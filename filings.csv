ARQ,"Arq, Inc.",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1515156/000151515625000014/arq-20241231.htm," Item 1A. Risk Factors 

The following risks relate to us as of the date this Report is filed with the SEC. This list of risks is not intended to be exhaustive, but reflects what we believe are the material risks inherent in our business and the ownership of our securities as of the specified dates. A statement to the effect that the occurrence of a specified event may have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, profitability, financial condition, or the like, is intended to reflect the fact that such an event, if it occurs, would be likely to have a negative impact on your investment in Arq, but should not imply the likelihood of the occurrence of such specified event. The order in which the following risk factors are presented is not intended as an indication of the relative seriousness of any given risk. 

Risks Related to Our Business 

We may be unable to meet our projected commissioning timelines, costs and production ramp up for our capital upgrades at our Red River Plant, or we may experience difficulties in generating and maintaining demand for products manufactured there. 

Our ability to increase production of GAC on a sustained basis is dependent on the construction, commissioning, and ramp of upgrades at our Red River Plant. We have achieved mechanical completion of construction at our Red River Plant. However, the commissioning, commencement and ramp of production at this facility are subject to a number of uncertainties inherent in all new manufacturing operations. These include ongoing liquidity requirements for funding the expansion of the facility, ongoing compliance with regulatory requirements, environmental and operational licenses and approvals for additional expansion, supply chain constraints, hiring, training and retention of qualified employees and the pace of bringing production equipment and processes online with the capability to manufacture high-quality GAC products at scale. In September 2024, we terminated an existing contract we had previously entered into with a third-party contractor for the construction of the GAC Facility at our Red River Plant after a number of construction delays and cost overruns became apparent. We then moved the construction and project management functions for the GAC Facility internally in order to limit any further construction delays. 

However, if we experience any further issues or delays in meeting our projected timelines, costs, or production capacity for the upgrades at our Red River Plant, or generating and maintaining demand for the products we manufacture there, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition may be harmed. We anticipate financing the completion and ramp-up of the GAC Facility with cash on hand, cash generation, ongoing cost reduction initiatives, and through borrowings on our Revolving Credit Facility. Mechanical completion of construction of the GAC Facility was completed in January 2025. We expect to complete commissioning activities and commence production at the GAC Facility by the end of the first quarter of 2025. If we experience any further delays or unexpected additional costs such as those described above, the project timeline for our Red River Plant expansion may be delayed beyond the end of the first quarter of 2025. 

Manufacturing Legacy Arq's products and GAC products requires significant capital. 

Legacy Arq was a development stage entity that, prior to the Arq Acquisition, had not generated any revenue. Legacy Arq historically had operating losses and required multiple financing rounds to fund its business plan. We are currently spending significant capital to execute our business plan to manufacture Legacy Arq&#8217;s products as a feedstock for GAC products. We have issued common stock in multiple equity offerings and entered into our Revolving Credit Facility to assist with funding these capital requirements, in addition to utilizing cash on hand. We are targeting the end of the first quarter of 2025 for our first commercial production of Legacy Arq products and for our first commercial production of GAC products at our Red River Plant. To meet these production timing goals and to fund ongoing production of our GAC products, we may need to raise additional capital. We may not be successful in obtaining the required financing or, if financing is available to us, such financing may not be on terms that are favorable to us. The failure to maintain adequate liquidity to enable the Company to produce Legacy Arq products and GAC products by the end of the first quarter of 2025 on a going forward basis could result in a delay in executing our business plan, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 

Current and future indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business. 

As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $13.8 million outstanding and $16.2 million available under our Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, upon completion of the Arq Acquisition, we assumed a term loan (the ""CTB Loan"") held by Legacy Arq with a financial institution (""CTB"") in the principal amount of $10.0 million. We may incur additional indebtedness. Our 

Revolving Credit Facility contains a floating interest rate. Our levels of indebtedness and higher interest rates could impact us as follows: 

&#8226; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund acquisitions or working capital; 

&#8226; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business; 

&#8226; restrict us from exploiting business opportunities; 

&#8226; make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy; 

&#8226; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness; 

&#8226; require the consent of our existing lenders to incur additional indebtedness; 

&#8226; limit our ability to borrow additional funds for acquisitions, working capital, or debt-service requirements; 

&#8226; increase our cost of capital, including as a result of higher interest rates; 

&#8226; decrease our future earnings; or 

&#8226; increase our exposure to the credit risks of bank group lenders or those institutions with which we maintain deposits. 

Our Revolving Credit Agreement and CTB Loan contain financial and other restrictive covenants. For example, the Revolving Credit Agreement includes financial covenants that require us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum liquidity level (as these terms are defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement). These covenants could limit our ability to engage in activities that are in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with these covenants would result in an event of default that, if not waived, could result in the acceleration of all outstanding indebtedness. Our Revolving Credit Facility and CTB Loan have maturity dates of December 27, 2029 and January 27, 2036, respectively. In the future, we may be unable to obtain new financing or refinancing on acceptable terms. See Note 5 ""Debt Obligations"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for further information. 

The Arq Acquisition has required significant technological changes in manufacturing that may adversely affect the market acceptance of Legacy Arq&#8217;s products. 

Upon completion and commencement of commercial production at our GAC Facility we will be producing GAC products that we have not yet sold commercially. Legacy Arq&#8217;s manufacturing technology has been extensively tested at scale, but continuous operations represent risks including an inability to achieve the scale-up efficiencies that have been assumed in our business plan. In turn, this could impact throughput or yields at our Corbin Facility, which could lead to lower production and higher operating costs. There is also risk of delays that are product-specific. For example, we may not receive required state or municipal approval for our new GAC products in a timely manner, adequate customer acceptance of our new GAC products or achieve acceptable performance given the specification differentiation between some of Legacy Arq&#8217;s products and the industry&#8217;s existing conventional products. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 

There could be no future demand for Legacy Arq&#8217;s products. 

Our initial use for Arq Powder is as a feedstock for AC, and although we believe current conditions are favorable as a result of excess demand versus supply, there can be no guarantee that this will continue. Drivers of demand include factors beyond our control such as population growth, regulatory requirements and gross domestic product growth, amongst others. Any major global downturn could also materially negatively impact this demand. New AC supply is driven by new manufacturing sites being built, and we have little visibility on what additional manufacturing capacity other manufacturers may add in the future. 

Our business plan and commercial success also assumes selling Arq Powder into new markets, including as an additive into the asphalt market. Although testing data and feedback from potential customers have been generally positive to date, there can be no assurance that these products will be commercially viable. As we attempt to develop and grow Arq Powder utilization worldwide, our success will depend on our ability to gain market acceptance and to correctly forecast demand in these new markets. There is no assurance that we will be able to increase our business to meet targets globally, or that projections on which such targets are based will prove accurate, or that the pace of growth or coverage will meet customer expectations. 

Our future financial results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following the Arq Acquisition. 

Following the Arq Acquisition, the size of our business has increased. Our future results depend, in part, upon our ability to manage this expanded business, which poses substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurance that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements and other benefits currently anticipated from the Arq Acquisition. 

Disruptions at any of our facilities could negatively impact our ability to meet customer supply requirements due to damage to or insufficient production capacity of the Red River Plant and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

We own and operate the Red River Plant, which is our sole manufacturing plant for producing and selling AC products to our customers, and own and operate the Corbin Facility, which is our sole production facility for manufacturing Arq Powder. Our current and future ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve our objectives for operating efficiencies depends on the full-time operation of the Red River Plant, and the execution of our business plan depends on the integration of the Corbin Facility as the primary source of feedstock for the GAC Facility's commissioning and ramp-up of commercial production. We cannot replicate our manufacturing methods at another plant due to the limited availability of similar manufacturing plants, the additional costs incurred in supplying raw materials such as lignite to another plant, and the risk of revealing our confidential and proprietary technologies and manufacturing processes. 

If we experience a disruption at these facilities, due to natural disasters, extreme weather, other unanticipated problems such as labor difficulties, pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), equipment failure, cyberattacks or other cybersecurity incidents, capacity expansion difficulties or unscheduled maintenance, we would suffer a loss of inventory to supply customers, likely incur additional costs to deliver products to our customers, and disrupt the ordinary course of our business. In addition, if contractual demand exceeds manufacturing capacity, we would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under our contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales, profitability, contract penalties or terminations and damage to our customer relationships and could have a material adverse effect on our business. While we have insured our facilities against damage or destruction as well as for losses from business interruptions, there can be no assurance that any insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover any such losses. 

Further, a prolonged disruption in our operations at the Red River Plant due to downtime or having to meet customer requirements that exceed our maximum manufacturing capacity would require us to seek alternative customer supply arrangements, which may not be on attractive terms to us or could lead to delays in distribution of products to our customers, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

There can be no assurance that the Arq Acquisition will result in additional value for our stockholders. 

There can be no assurance that the Arq Acquisition will provide greater value to our stockholders than that reflected in the current price of our common stock. As a result of the Arq Acquisition, perceived uncertainties related to our future may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and volatility in the market price of our common stock, which may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners. 

In connection with the Arq Acquisition, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could negatively affect our business, assets, liabilities, prospects, outlook, financial condition and results of operations. 

Although we conducted extensive due diligence in connection with the Arq Acquisition, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Further, as a result of the Arq Acquisition, we may be required to take write-offs or write-downs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could negatively affect our business, assets, liabilities, prospects, outlook, financial condition and results of operations. 

The failure to continue to successfully integrate the Legacy Arq businesses in the expected timeframe could adversely affect our future business and financial performance. 

The combination of two independent companies is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. As a result, we have devoted and continue to devote significant management attention and resources to integrate Legacy Arq's operations, including in connection with the completion of our GAC Facility. We may not be successful in integrating the operations of Legacy Arq or 

otherwise realizing the anticipated benefits of the Arq Acquisition. In addition, the continued integration of Legacy Arq may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer relationships and diversion of management&#8217;s attention, and may cause our stock price to decline. The difficulties of combining the operations of the two companies include, among others: 

&#8226; managing a larger company; 

&#8226; coordinating geographically separate organizations; 

&#8226; the potential diversion of management&#8217;s focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and from operational matters; 

&#8226; performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management&#8217;s attention caused by integrating the combined companies&#8217; operations; 

&#8226; aligning and executing a new business strategy; 

&#8226; retaining existing customers and attracting new customers; 

&#8226; maintaining employee morale and retaining key members of management and other employees; 

&#8226; the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, each company&#8217;s ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, systems, procedures and policies; 

&#8226; the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process; 

&#8226; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations; 

&#8226; coordinating sales, distribution and marketing efforts; 

&#8226; maintaining research and development technology momentum and leading customer technical collaboration progress; 

&#8226; significant changes to current market conditions that may adversely affect the business plan; 

&#8226; integrating IT, communications and other systems; 

&#8226; changes in applicable laws and regulations; 

&#8226; managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating Legacy Arq's operations; 

&#8226; unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the Arq Acquisition, including the completion of the GAC Facility; 

&#8226; creating a logistics network to reliably allow use of Arq Powder as a feedstock in the GAC Facility; and 

&#8226; taking actions that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals. 

Many of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue and diversion of management&#8217;s time and energy, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even if the operations of Legacy Arq are integrated successfully, we may not realize the full benefits from the Arq Acquisition, including the synergies, cost savings or growth opportunities that we expect. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated timeframe, or at all. 

Specifically, the realization of the full benefits from the Arq Acquisition is dependent on our ability to construct expansions to existing facilities and to integrate Arq Powder on the projected timeline and within the projected budget. If these anticipated capital expenditures are delayed, whether as a result of unanticipated challenges in permitting, construction or economic conditions, the cost of such activities may increase and the timing of projected revenue may be impacted. Further, the costs of such construction activities have and may continue to significantly exceed the budgeted costs. The costs of construction or other anticipated capital expenditures are subject to the effects of the current inflationary environment and we may not be able to successfully offset the effects of inflation. See ""Item 1A. Risk Factors - We may be unable to meet our projected construction timelines, costs and production ramp up for our capital upgrades at our Red River Plant, or we may experience difficulties in generating and maintaining demand for products manufactured there."" above for further information. 

The synergies attributable to the Arq Acquisition may vary from expectations. 

We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies expected from the Arq Acquisition. Our success will depend, in significant part, on our ability to successfully integrate the Legacy Arq business and realize the anticipated strategic benefits and synergies. We continue to believe that the combination of the two businesses will allow us to enter into more diversified, higher margin markets with our products. However, achieving these goals requires, among other things, realization of the targeted cost synergies expected from the Arq Acquisition. These anticipated benefits and actual operating, technological, strategic and revenue opportunities may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. If we are not able to achieve these objectives and realize the anticipated benefits and synergies expected from the Arq Acquisition within the anticipated timeframe or at all, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely impacted. 

Strategic relationships upon which we rely on are subject to change, which may diminish our ability to conduct our operations. 

Our ability to successfully produce Legacy Arq&#8217;s products and expand their utilization as intended depends on developing and maintaining close working relationships with industry participants. In addition, the dynamics of maintaining these relationships with strategic partners may require us to incur expenses or undertake activities we would not otherwise be inclined to do. If these strategic relationships are not established or maintained, our business prospects may be limited, which could negatively impact our business and results of operations. 

If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock. 

Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. We cannot be certain that our efforts to maintain an effective system of internal controls will be successful, will be able to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future, or will be able to comply with our obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. As we continue to integrate Legacy Arq's operations, any failure to maintain effective internal controls, or difficulties encountered in implementing or improving internal controls, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls could additionally lead to increased costs to remediate any failures and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. 

The financial effects of Tinuum Group providing indemnification under performance guarantees of its refined coal (""RC"") facilities are largely unknown and could adversely affect our financial condition. 

Tinuum Group, LLC (""Tinuum Group""), of which we hold a 42.5% ownership interest, indemnifies certain utilities and lessees of RC facilities for particular risks associated with the operations and tax treatment of those facilities. We have provided limited, joint and several guarantees of Tinuum Group&#8217;s obligations under those leases. To date, we have not been required to make any payments under such guarantees and are not aware of any actual or threatened requests or claims for payment under such guarantees. Nevertheless, if any such obligations are triggered in the future, any substantial payments made under such guarantees could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

A pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease such as COVID-19 may materially adversely affect our business. 

The global or national outbreak of an infectious disease, such as COVID-19, may cause disruptions to our business and operational plans, which may include (i) shortages of employees, (ii) inefficiencies, delays and additional costs in our manufacturing, sales and customer service efforts, (iii) recommendations of, or restrictions imposed by, government and health authorities, including quarantines, to address an infectious disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and (iv) restrictions that we impose, including facility shutdowns, to ensure the safety of employees and others. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response. While it is not possible to predict the outbreak of any new infectious disease, the disruptions that may result from such an outbreak may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Demand for our products and services depends significantly on environmental laws and regulations related to emissions. Uncertainty as to the future of such laws and regulations, changes to such laws and regulations or granting of extensions of compliance deadlines has had, and will likely continue to have, a material effect on our business. 

A significant market driver for our existing products and services and those planned in the future are existing and expected environmental laws and regulations, particularly those addressing the reduction of mercury and other emissions from coal-fired electricity generating units and regulation of PFAS and other pollutants. For example, we expect consumables revenue to increase in the coming years as a result of EPA regulations of PFAS substances in drinking water finalized in April 2024. If, as a result of the new U.S. presidential administration or developments in administrative law jurisprudence, such laws and regulations are delayed, not enacted, repealed, amended to be less strict, or include prolonged phase-in periods, or are not enforced, our business would be adversely affected by declining demand for such products and services. For example: 

1. The implementation of environmental regulations regarding certain pollution control and permitting requirements has been delayed from time to time due to various lawsuits. In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of the Chevron Doctrine in 2024 may result in further litigation challenging the validity of current or proposed environmental regulations. The uncertainty created by litigation and reconsideration of rule-making by the EPA or other regulatory agencies may negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition and will likely continue to do so. 

2. To the extent federal, state and local legislation mandating that electric power generating companies serving a state or region purchase a minimum amount of power from renewable energy sources such as wind, hydroelectric, solar and geothermal, and such amount lessens demand for electricity from coal-fired plants, the demand for our products and services would likely decrease. 

3. In January and February 2025, the new U.S. presidential administration issued a series of executive orders (""EOs"") that, among other things, (i) withdraws the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, adopted at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; (ii) calls upon the EPA to submit a report on the continuing applicability of its endangerment finding for greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act and issue guidance on the ""social cost of carbon"" to consider whether such metric should be eliminated, and (iii) directs federal executive departments and agencies to initiate a regulatory freeze for certain rules that have not taken effect, pending review by the newly appointed agency head. 

Federal, state and international laws or regulations addressing emissions from coal-fired electricity generating units, climate change or other actions to limit emissions, including public opposition to new coal-fired electricity generating units, has caused and could continue to cause electricity generators to transition from coal to other fuel and power sources, such as natural gas, nuclear, wind, hydroelectric and solar. The potential financial impact on us of future laws or regulations or public pressure will depend upon the degree to which electricity generators diminish their reliance on coal as a fuel source. That, in turn, will depend on a number of factors, including the specific requirements imposed by any such laws or regulations, the periods over which those laws or regulations are or will be phased in, the amount of public opposition and the state and cost of commercial development of related technologies and processes. In addition, public utility commissions may not allow utilities to charge consumers for, and pass on the cost of, emissions control technologies without federal or state mandates. 

Our development operations at our facilities are subject to environmental permitting and regulations that can make operations expensive, or prohibit them altogether. For example, at our Corbin Facility, we use high-quality recovered bituminous coal fines as a feedstock to produce Arq Powder, and the majority of sites we target for development and extraction of such fines contain potential environmental liabilities. Additionally, new CERCLA regulations and further regulations of PFAS substances may increase the costs of handling, transport, and disposal of PFAS-containing materials, including water treatment waste, such as spent GAC. Therefore, we may be subject to potential risks and liabilities associated with pollution of the environment and the disposal of waste products that could occur as a result of these development and production activities. Further, we cannot reasonably predict the impact that any such future laws or regulations or public opposition may have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. 

With the Arq Acquisition, we are subject to additional significant governmental regulations, which may negatively impact our operations and costs of conducting business. 

The Corbin Facility's operations are governed by extensive laws and regulations, including: 

&#8226; laws and regulations related to exports, taxes and fees; 

&#8226; labor standards and regulations related to the MSHA; and 

&#8226; environmental standards and regulations related to waste disposal, toxic substances, land use and environmental protection, including environmental protection regulations related to water and air. 

Existing and possible future laws, regulations and permits governing operations and activities of energy waste companies, or more stringent implementation, could have a material adverse impact on our business and cause increases in capital expenditures or require abandonment or delays in our products. Any future regulations regarding CO 2 emissions of coal reclamation and product manufacturing could also impact our future business. 

Action by the EPA related to MATS that decreases demand for our mercury removal products could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Our operating performance is largely dependent upon demand for mercury removal-related products, which is largely affected by the amount of coal-based power generation used in the U.S. and the continued regulation of utilities under the EPA's MATS Rule. In May 2020, the EPA reconsidered and withdrew its 2016 ""supplemental finding"" associated with the cost benefit analysis of the MATS Rule. In this action, the EPA found that it was not ""appropriate and necessary"" to regulate Hazardous Air Pollutants (""HAP"") emissions from coal- and oil-fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units (""EGUs""). However, the EPA expressly stated that the reconsideration neither removed coal- and oil-fired EGUs from the list of sources that must comply with the MATS Rule, nor rescinded the MATS Rule, which has remained continuously in effect. On February 9, 2022, the EPA published a new proposed rule revoking the May 2020 withdrawal of the 2016 supplemental finding and affirming that it is ""appropriate and necessary"" to regulate HAP emissions from coal- and oil-fired EGUs. On February 15, 2023, the EPA issued a final rule revoking the May 2020 reconsideration and affirming that it is ""appropriate and necessary"" to regulate HAP emissions from coal- and oil-fired EGUs. On April 3, 2023, the EPA issued a proposed update to MATS that amongst other potential modifications, proposed a reduction to the mercury emission limits for lignite coal-fired EGUs. The EPA adopted the final rule on April 25, 2024. However, there can be no assurance that the final rule will stand unchallenged, given the change in U.S. presidential administration, related EOs and developments in administrative law jurisprudence. Any action taken by the EPA related to MATS that decreases demand for our products for mercury removal will have a negative effect on our financial results. 

The failure of tariffs or duties placed on U.S. imports of Chinese AC to adequately address the impact of low-priced imports from China could have a material adverse effect on the competitiveness and financial performance of our business. 

Our business faces competition in the U.S. from low-priced imports of AC products. If the volumes of these low-priced imports increase, especially if they are sold at less than fair value, our sales of competing products could decline, which could have an adverse effect our earnings. In addition, sales of these low-priced imports may negatively impact our pricing. To limit these activities, regulators in the U.S. have enacted an anti-dumping duty order on steam AC products from China. In November 2023, the order was extended for an additional five years. The amount of anti-dumping duties collected on imports of steam AC from China is reviewed annually by the U.S. Department of Commerce. To the extent the anti-dumping margins do not adequately address the degree to which imports are unfairly traded, the anti-dumping order may be less effective in reducing the volume of these low-priced AC imports in the U.S., which could negatively affect demand and/or pricing for our products. 

The market for consumables and other products that provide pollutant reduction is highly competitive, and some of our competitors are significantly larger and more established than we are, which could adversely impede our growth opportunities and financial results. 

We operate in a highly competitive marketplace. Our ability to compete successfully depends in part upon our ability to maintain a production cost advantage, competitive technological capabilities and to continue to identify, develop and commercialize new and innovative products for existing and future customers. We may face increased competition from existing or newly developed products offered by industry competitors or other companies whose products offer a similar functionality as our products and could be substituted for our products, which may negatively affect demand for our products. In addition, market competition could negatively impact our ability to maintain or raise prices or maintain or grow our market position. Additionally, our competitors are significantly larger and/or more established companies in the market for consumables and other products that provide mercury emissions reduction, water treatment and air purification. 

Reduction of coal consumption by North American electricity power generators could result in less demand for our products and services. If utilities significantly reduce the number of coal-fired electricity generating units or the amount of coal burned without a corresponding increase in the services required at the remaining units, this could reduce our revenue and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The amount of coal consumed for North American electricity power generation is affected by, among other things, (1) the location, availability, quality and price of alternative energy sources for power generation, such as natural gas, fuel oil, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind, biomass and solar power; and (2) technological developments, including those related to competing alternative energy sources. 

Natural gas-fueled generation and renewable energy generation have displaced and may continue to displace coal-fueled generation, particularly from older, less efficient coal-powered generators. We expect that a significant amount of the new power generation necessary to meet increasing demand for electricity generation will be fueled by these sources. The price of natural gas has remained relatively competitive for power generation and the use of natural gas is perceived as having a lower environmental impact than burning coal. Natural gas-fired plants are cheaper to construct, and permits to construct these plants are easier to obtain, and ongoing costs of natural gas-fired plants associated with meeting environmental compliance are lower. Possible advances in technologies and incentives, such as tax credits that enhance the economics of renewable energy sources, could make those sources more competitive than coal. Any reduction in the amount of coal consumed by domestic electricity power generators, whether as a result of new power plants utilizing alternative energy sources or as a result of technological advances, could reduce the demand for our current products and services, thereby reducing our revenue and materially and adversely affecting our business and results of operations. 

Additionally, long-term changes in environmental regulation that threaten or preclude the use of coal or other fossil fuels as a primary fuel source for electricity production may result in the reduction or closure of a significant number of coal-fired electric generating units, and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The loss of, or significant reduction in, revenue from our largest customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

For 2024, we derived approximately 45% of our total revenue from our five largest customers. Our top three customers accounted for approximately 36% of our total revenue for 2024. While we attempt to mitigate such risk by entering into long-term contracts with minimum purchase obligations, if any of our five largest customers were to significantly reduce the quantities of consumables they purchase from us or cease purchasing from us altogether, it may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We depend on the services of our executives and other key employees, and the loss of one or more of these individuals could harm our business. 

We believe that our success depends on retaining qualified executives and other key employees, especially in light of the specialized nature of our business. These individuals have significant industry and Company-specific experience. If we are unsuccessful at retaining or attracting qualified personnel, our business could be disrupted and our reputation could be harmed, adversely affecting our ability to achieve our business objectives. 

Uncertain geopolitical conditions could adversely affect our business. 

Uncertain geopolitical conditions, including in connection with the new U.S. presidential administration, the conflicts in the Middle East, the invasion of Ukraine, sanctions against Russia, increased domestic and international tariffs and other potential impacts on the world economy and currencies may cause disruptions in our business. These include logistics delays or shortages in producing and shipping certain of our raw materials, increases in energy prices that could increase costs of certain of our raw materials, increases in transportation costs from overall higher gasoline prices, higher prices due to tariffs, and cyber-attacks targeted at U.S. power infrastructure that could impact demand for our products. 

Disruptions of supply chains may affect volatility in price and availability of raw materials. 

The continuation of geopolitical conflicts in 2024 has continued to disrupt supply chains, resulting in cost increases for commodities, goods and services in many parts of the world. Disruptions of supply chains and higher costs may continue into 2025 and beyond. The economic effects from these events over longer terms could negatively impact our business and results of operations. 

The manufacturing and processing of our consumable products requires significant amounts of raw materials. The price and availability of those raw materials can be impacted by factors beyond our control. Our consumable products, exclusive of lignite coal, use a variety of additives. Significant movements or volatility in the costs of additives could have an adverse effect on our working capital or results of operations. Additionally, we purchase certain raw materials from selected key suppliers. While we have inventory of such raw materials, if any of these suppliers are unable to meet their obligations with us on a timely basis or at an acceptable price, we may be forced to incur higher costs to obtain the necessary raw materials or be unable to obtain the materials. 

We may attempt to offset the increase in raw material costs or challenges in the supply of raw materials with price increases allowed in our contractual relationships, or through cost reduction efforts. If we are unable to fully offset the increased cost of raw materials through price increases, it could significantly impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We may experience a shortage of reliable and adequate transport capacity and any material increase in transportation costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 

We plan to transport our Arq Powder based feedstock produced at the Corbin Facility to the Red River Plant by rail and truck. Additionally, we use rail and truck transport to deliver our products to our customers. We may experience roadway or railway transportation disruptions that could have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure sufficient truck or railway transport capacity to transport raw materials from the Corbin Facility to the Red River Plant or our finished commercial products to our customers. Further, in the event of railway transport shortages, there can be no assurance that road transportation will be able to satisfy the shortfall. Potential transportation classifications of raw materials or spent product may require permitting, and special care and handling to transport such materials, including the transportation of spent PFAS filtration media. In addition, any material increase in transportation costs could have a negative effect on the competitiveness of our future products, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 

We face operational risks inherent in mining operations, and our mining operations have the potential to cause safety issues, including those that could result in significant personal injury. 

We own the Five Forks Mine, a lignite coal mine located in Louisiana, which is operated for us by a third party. Mining operations by their nature involve a high level of uncertainty and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control. At the Five Forks Mine, the risks are primarily operational risks associated with the maintenance and operation of the heavy equipment required to dig and haul the lignite and risks relating to producing lower than expected lignite quality or unfavorable recovery rates. Additionally, the cost of inputs in our mining operation, most notably fuel cost, can create operational risks. The failure to adequately manage these risks could result in significant personal injury, loss of life, damage to mineral properties, production facilities or mining equipment, damage to the environment, delays in or reduced production and potential legal liabilities. 

Our operations and products are subject to extensive safety, health and environmental requirements that could increase our costs and/or impair our ability to manufacture and sell certain products. 

Our ongoing operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to safety, health and environmental matters, many of which provide for substantial monetary fines and potential criminal sanctions for violations. These include requirements to obtain and comply with various environmental-related permits for constructing any new facilities (or modifications to existing facilities) and operating all of our existing facilities. Costs of complying with regulations could increase, as concerns related to greenhouse gases and climate change continue to emerge. 

The enactment of new environmental laws and regulations and/or the more aggressive interpretation of existing requirements could require us to incur significant costs for compliance or capital improvements or limit our current or planned operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings or cash flow. We may attempt to offset the effects of these compliance costs through price increases, productivity improvements and cost reduction efforts. Our success in offsetting any such increased regulatory costs is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the market segment served. Such increases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be sufficient to compensate for increased regulatory costs or may decrease demand for our products and our volume of sales. 

We may not be successful in achieving our growth expectations related to new products in our existing or new markets. 

Our ability to bring new products to the market will depend on various factors, including, but not limited to, solving potential technical or manufacturing difficulties, competition and market acceptance, which may hinder the timeliness and cost to bring 

such products to production. In addition, our anticipated production capacity for any new product, including our GAC products, may be limited if we experience material delays in commissioning or other areas as we ramp-up commercial production. Further, there can be no assurance that costs incurred to develop new products will result in an increase in revenue. These factors or delays could affect our future operating results. 

Natural disasters or extreme weather could affect our operations and financial results. 

We operate facilities, including the Red River Plant, Five Forks Mine and the Corbin Facility, that are exposed to natural hazards, such as floods, windstorms and hurricanes. Extreme weather events present physical risks that may become more frequent as a result of factors related to climate change. Such events could disrupt our supply of raw materials or otherwise affect production, transportation and delivery of our products or affect demand for our products. 

In addition, extreme and unusually cold or hot temperatures throughout the U.S. could result in abnormally high loads on geographic electrical grids that could result in the failure of coal-fired power plants to produce electricity. If these plants were off-line for a significant period of time, the demand for our products could be less, which would impact our operations and financial results. Conversely, abnormally high loads on geographic electrical grids, resulting in increased demand of coal-fired power plants to produce electricity, could impact our ability to meet customer contracts and demands. 

We are subject to risks related to environmental, social or governance (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) matters, including our ability to set and meet reasonable goals related to climate change and sustainability efforts, may negatively affect our business and operations. 

Regulatory developments and stakeholder expectations relating to ESG matters are rapidly changing. Concern over climate change has increased focus on the sustainability of practices and products in the markets we serve, and changes to laws and regulations regarding climate change mitigation may result in increased costs and disruption to operations. Moreover, stakeholder expectations are not uniform, and both opponents and proponents of various ESG matters have increasingly engaged in a range of activism and action to advocate for their positions. Navigating varying expectations of policymakers and other stakeholders has inherent costs, and any failure to successfully navigate such expectations may expose us to negative publicity, shareholder activism, and litigation or other engagement from stakeholders with opposing views, as well as the potential for civil investigations and enforcement by federal governmental authorities. If we are unable to recognize and respond to such developments, or if our existing practices and procedures are not adequate to meet changing regulatory requirements, market standards or investor expectations, some of which may be conflicting, we may miss corporate opportunities, become subject to regulatory scrutiny, litigation or third-party claims, or incur costs to revise operations to meet new or revised standards. Moreover, any harm to our reputation could impact employee engagement and retention and the willingness of customers and our partners to do business with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows. 

In 2024, we published our first corporate responsibility and sustainability tear sheet and inaugural ESG Report to address the impact of our operations on climate change and discuss material social, governance and environmental issues. Any failure or perceived failure to act responsibly with respect to such matters may negatively impact our operations and/or financial condition. While we monitor a broad range of ESG issues, there can be no assurance that we will manage such issues successfully, or that we will successfully meet the expectations of our stakeholders, consumers and employees. 

Information technology vulnerabilities and cyberattacks on our networks could have a material adverse impact on our business. 

We rely on information technology (""IT"") to manage and conduct business, both internally and externally, with our customers, suppliers and other third parties. Internet transactions involve the transmission and storage of data including customer and supplier business information. Therefore, maintaining the security of computers and other electronic devices, computer networks and data storage resources is a critical issue for us and our customers and suppliers because security breaches could result in reduced or lost ability to carry on our business and loss of, and/or unauthorized access to, confidential information. 

We have limited personnel and other resources to address information technology reliability and security of our computer networks, and to respond to known security incidents to minimize potential adverse impact. Experienced hackers, cybercriminals and perpetrators of threats may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. These perpetrators of cyberattacks also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, malware and other malicious software programs that attack our information and networks or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our information and networks. 

Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until after they are launched against a target, and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. A breach of our IT systems and security measures or those of our third party partners as a result of third party action, malware, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise could materially adversely impact our business and results of operations and expose us to customer, supplier and other third party liabilities. 

Risks Related to Intellectual Property 

Failure to protect our intellectual property or infringement of our intellectual property by a third party could have an adverse impact on our financial condition. 

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. Such means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate because they provide only limited protection or such protection may be prohibitively expensive to enforce. We also enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, consultants and many of our customers and vendors, and generally control access to and distribution of our proprietary information. Notwithstanding these measures, a third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information without authorization. We cannot provide assurance that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology and intellectual property, which could negatively impact our business and financial condition. In addition, such actions taken by third parties could divert the attention of our management from the operation of our business. 

We may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from third parties that are costly to defend and that may limit our ability to use the disputed technologies. 

If our technologies are alleged to infringe the intellectual property rights of others, we may be forced to mount a defense to such claims, which may be expensive and time consuming. During the pendency of litigation, we could be prevented from marketing and selling existing products or services and from pursuing research, development or commercialization of new or complimentary products or services. Further, we may be required to obtain licenses to third party intellectual property or be forced to develop or obtain alternative technologies. Our failure to obtain a license to a technology that we may require, or the need to develop or obtain alternative technologies, could significantly and negatively affect our business. 

Indemnification of third-party licensees of our technologies against intellectual property infringement claims concerning our licensed technology and our products could be financially significant to us. 

We have agreed to indemnify licensees of our technologies (including Tinuum Group) and purchasers of our products, and we may enter into additional agreements with others under which we agree to indemnify and hold them harmless from losses they may incur as a result of the alleged infringement of third-party rights caused by the use of our technologies and products. Infringement claims, which may be expensive and time-consuming to defend, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition, even if we are successful in defending ourselves (and the indemnified parties) against them. 

Our future success depends in part on our ongoing identification and development of intellectual property and our ability to invest in and deploy new products, services and technologies into the marketplace efficiently and cost effectively. 

The process of identifying customer needs and developing and enhancing products, services and solutions for our customer markets is complex, costly and uncertain. Any failure by us to identify and anticipate changing needs, emerging trends and new regulations could significantly harm our future market share and results of operations. 

Risk related to tax matters 

Our ability to utilize our tax assets to offset future income tax liability could be limited from an ""ownership change."" 

In general, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (""IRC') a corporation that undergoes an ""ownership change"" is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses (""NOLs"") and tax credits to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders (generally 5% stockholders (as defined in IRC Section 382), applying certain look-through rules) increases by more than 50 percentage points during the testing period (generally a three-year lookback period). An entity that experiences an ownership change generally is subject to an annual limitation on its pre-ownership change tax asset carryforwards. The annual limitation is increased each year to the extent that there is an unused limitation in a prior year. 

We acquired certain tax assets (the ""Legacy Arq Tax Assets"") in the Arq Acquisition, totaling approximately $12.5 million. The Legacy Arq Tax Assets are comprised of NOL carryforwards, of which $8.8 million were incurred in the U.S. Further, as of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $86.1 million of general business credit carryforwards (the ""Tax Credits""), totaling approximately 75% of consolidated tax assets. Under the IRC and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS, we may carry forward or otherwise utilize our NOLs and Tax Credits (collectively, ""Tax Assets"") in certain circumstances to offset current and future federal income tax liabilities, subject to certain requirements and restrictions. However, our ability to use our Tax Assets to offset future federal income tax liability is limited if Legacy Arq or Arq, or both, experience an ""ownership change"" as discussed above. To the extent that the Tax Assets do not otherwise become limited, we believe that we will have available a significant amount of Tax Assets in future years, and therefore the Tax Assets could be a substantial asset to us. 

In connection with the Arq Acquisition and PIPE Investment, the May 2024 Private Placement and the September 2024 Offering, we issued additional shares of our common stock. With respect to the Arq Acquisition and PIPE Investment, we performed an IRC Section 382 analysis as of the Acquisition Date and determined that we had not experienced an ""ownership change"" as of that date. If we were to experience an ""ownership change,"" it is possible that a significant portion of our Tax Assets could expire before we would be able to use them to offset future federal income tax liability. 

Prior to the Acquisition Date, Legacy Arq completed numerous equity offerings that resulted in ownership changes. We have not completed a formal IRC Section 382 analysis of Legacy Arq equity changes from its inception through the Acquisition Date, however, we believe that one or more ""ownership changes"" occurred during this time period as defined under Sections 382 and 383 and that a portion or all the Legacy Arq Tax Assets may subject to an annual limitation. 

To mitigate the risk of an ""ownership change,"" on May 5, 2017, our Board approved the Tax Asset Protection Plan (the ""TAPP"") and declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (each, a ""Right"") for each outstanding share of our common stock. The TAPP was adopted in an effort to protect stockholder value by attempting to diminish the risk that our ability to use the existing Tax Credits to reduce potential future federal income tax obligations may become substantially limited (the ""Protection Plan""). During the years 2018 through 2024, we executed amendments to the TAPP (the ""TAPP Amendments""), which amended the definition of ""Final Expiration Date"" under the TAPP to extend the duration of the TAPP and makes associated changes in connection therewith. The most recent TAPP Amendment was approved at our 2024 annual meeting of stockholders and extended the Final Expiration Date to the close of business on December 31, 2025. 

The TAPP, as amended, is intended to act as a deterrent to any person acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.99% or more of our outstanding common stock without the approval of the Board. Stockholders who beneficially owned 4.99% or more of our outstanding common stock upon execution of the Protection Plan will not trigger the Protection Plan so long as they do not acquire beneficial ownership of additional shares of our common stock. The Board may, in its sole discretion, also exempt any person from triggering the Protection Plan. 

In connection with the Arq Acquisition and PIPE Investment, the May 2024 Private Placement and the September 2024 Offering, we granted waivers under the TAPP for certain stockholders to allow such stockholders to acquire the shares offered in the respective offerings and acquire more shares of our stock in the future, provided that such acquisition is not expected to, and does not, effect an ""ownership change"" under IRC Sections 382 and 383. Despite the TAPP, our projections of what will effect an ownership change could be wrong, and with a waiver in place for certain stockholders, there is a risk that we experience an ownership change for purposes of IRC Sections 382 and 383 because of future acquisitions of our common stock, which would limit the use of our existing Tax Assets. 

Risks Related to Our Common Stock 

Our stock price is subject to volatility. 

The market price of our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so. The market price of our common stock may continue to be affected by numerous factors, including: 

&#8226; market perception of the Arq Acquisition; 

&#8226; actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition; 

&#8226; changes in laws or regulations and court rulings and trends in our industry; 

&#8226; announcements of sales awards; 

&#8226; changes in supply and demand of our products and raw materials; 

&#8226; adoption of new tax regulations or accounting standards affecting our industry; 

&#8226; changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; 

&#8226; trends in social responsibility and investment guidelines; 

&#8226; whether we are able and elect to pay cash dividends; 

&#8226; the continuation of repurchasing shares of common stock under our stock repurchase programs; and 

&#8226; the degree of trading liquidity in our common stock and general market conditions. 

From January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024, the closing price of our common stock ranged from $2.59 to $8.02 per share. Stock price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which we repurchase shares of our common stock under our existing stock repurchase program to exceed the stock&#8217;s price at a given point in time. We believe our stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Board, and under our current stock repurchase program, we are not obligated to acquire any specific number of shares. If we fail to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, stock repurchases or other market expectations, our stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain additional capital and erode investor confidence, which could further reduce the liquidity of our common stock. We do not expect to repurchase additional shares of our common stock in the near term. 

Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us. 

Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. These include provisions that: 

&#8226; Limit the business at special meetings of stockholders to the purpose stated in a notice of the meeting; 

&#8226; Authorize the issuance of ""blank check"" preferred stock, which is preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede a takeover attempt and that the Board can create and issue without prior stockholder approval; 

&#8226; Establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the Board and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting; and 

&#8226; Require the affirmative vote of the ""disinterested"" holders of a majority of our common stock to approve certain business combinations involving an ""interested stockholder"" or its affiliates, unless either minimum price criteria or procedural requirements are met, or the transaction is approved by a majority of our ""continuing directors"" (known as ""fair price provisions""). 

These provisions, alone or in combination with each other, may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our common stock, or could limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interest. 

An increased focus on environmental, social and governance factors by institutional investors may negatively impact our access to capital and the liquidity of our stock price. 

Some institutional investors have recently adopted ESG investing guidelines that may prevent them from increasing or taking new stakes with companies with exposure to fossil fuels. Additional institutional investors may adopt similar ESG investment guidelines. This could limit both the demand for owning our common stock and/or our access to capital. If such capital is desired, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain any additional equity or debt financing on terms that are acceptable to us. Given these emerging trends, liquidity in our common stock and our stock price may be negatively impacted. 

We require additional funding for our growth plans, and such funding may require us to issue additional shares of our common stock resulting in a dilution of your investment. 

We estimate our funding requirements in order to implement our growth plans. If the actual funding required to implement growth initiatives should exceed funding estimates significantly, or our funds generated from our operations from such growth 

initiatives prove insufficient for such purposes, we may need to raise additional funds to meet these funding requirements. For example, as previously disclosed, capital expenditures related to the GAC Facility in the fourth quarter of 2024 were above what was originally budgeted, bringing fiscal year 2024 capital expenditures to approximately $80 million. 

Any additional funds required may be raised by issuing equity or debt securities or by borrowing from banks or other resources. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain any additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If we fail to obtain additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, we may not be able to implement such plans fully. Such financing, even if obtained, may be accompanied by conditions that limit our ability to pay dividends or require us to seek lenders&#8217; consent for payment of dividends, or restrict our ability to operate our business by requiring lender&#8217;s consent for certain corporate actions. Further, if we raise additional funds through the issuance of new shares of our common stock, any existing stockholders who are unable or unwilling to participate in such an additional round of fund raising may suffer dilution of their investment. 

Certain Legacy Arq shareholders and participants in the PIPE Investment hold a significant portion of the voting power of our common stock. 

Certain Legacy Arq shareholders and participants in the PIPE Investment hold a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock, and such persons, acting individually or together, could have the ability to exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a stockholder vote. The influence of these significant stockholders may be used in a manner that other stockholders may not support. Any such concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying certain corporate actions, and may consequently impact the ability of other stockholders to influence the management and policies of the Company.

There are many factors that affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and distributions. The following is a description of important factors that may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or discussed in forward-looking statements set forth in this Annual Report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we may currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. Forward-looking statements and such risks, uncertainties and other factors speak only as of the date of this Annual Report, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except to the extent otherwise required by law. See &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements.&#8221; 

Risks Related to Our Business and Operations 

The value of our real estate is subject to fluctuation, and risks related to investing in real estate may have an adverse effect on our financial condition. 

We are subject to all of the general risks associated with the ownership of real estate. While the revenues from our leases are not directly dependent upon the value of the underlying real estate, significant declines in real estate values could adversely affect us in many ways, including a decline in the residual values of properties at lease expiration, possible lease abandonments by our customers and a decline in the attractiveness of triple-net lease transactions to potential sellers. Moreover, significant declines in real estate values may also affect our ability to execute leases on attractive terms with potential customers. In addition, we periodically review our real estate assets for impairment based on the projected operating cash flow of the property over our anticipated holding period. Impairment charges have a direct impact on our results of operation. A financial failure or other default by a customer will likely reduce or eliminate the operating cash flow generated by that customer&#8217;s leased property and might decrease the value of that property and result in a non-cash impairment charge. Also, to the extent we purchase real estate in an unstable market, we are subject to the risk that if the real estate market ceases to attract the same level of capital investment in the future that it attracts at the time of our purchases, or the number of companies seeking to acquire properties decreases, the value of our investments may not appreciate or may decrease significantly below the amounts we paid. 

Contingent rent escalators may expose us to inflation risk and can hinder our growth and profitability. 

A substantial portion of our leases contain variable-rate contingent rent escalators that periodically increase the base rent payable by the customer. Our leases with rent escalators indexed to future increases in the Consumer Price Index (&#8220;CPI&#8221;) primarily adjust over a one-year period but may adjust over multiple-year periods. Generally, these escalators increase rent at (i) 1 to 1.25 times the change in the CPI over a specified period or (ii) a fixed percentage. As a result of these escalators, during periods of deflation or low inflation, small increases or decreases in the CPI may cause us to receive lower rental revenues than we would receive under leases with fixed-rate rent escalators. Conversely, when inflation is higher, contingent rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation. Higher inflation may also have an adverse impact on our customers if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue, which may adversely affect our customers&#8217; ability to satisfy their financial obligations to us. 

The success of our business depends upon the success of our customers&#8217; businesses, and bankruptcy laws will limit our remedies in the event of customer defaults. 

We lease substantially all of our properties to customers who operate businesses at the leased properties. We underwrite and evaluate investment risk on the basis that the profitability of these businesses is the primary source that supports the payments on our leases and loans, which we refer to as &#8220;unit-level profitability.&#8221; We believe the success of our investments materially depends upon whether our customers generate unit level profitability at the locations we acquire and lease back or finance. 

&#160; 

If any of our customers struggle financially, they may decline to extend or renew their leases, miss rental payments or declare bankruptcy. Claims for unpaid future rent are rarely paid in full and are subject to statutory limitations that would likely cause us to receive rental revenues substantially below the contractually specified rent. We are often subject to this risk because our triple-net leases generally involve a single tenant, but this risk is magnified when we lease multiple properties to a single customer under a master lease. Federal bankruptcy laws may prohibit us from evicting bankrupt customers solely upon bankruptcy, and we may not recover the premises promptly from the tenant or from a trustee or debtor-in-possession in bankruptcy proceedings. We may also be unable to re-lease a terminated or rejected space on comparable terms, or at all, or sell a vacant space upon a customer&#8217;s bankruptcy. We will be responsible for all of the operating costs at vacant properties until they are sold or re-let. 

Some service and service-oriented retail customers may be susceptible to e-commerce pressures. 

Most of our portfolio is leased to, or financed by, customers operating service or service-oriented retail businesses. Service and service-oriented retail businesses using physical outlets face increasing competition from online retailers and service providers. While we believe the businesses in our portfolio are relatively insulated from e-commerce pressures, these businesses may face increased competition from alternative online providers given the rapidly changing business conditions spurred by technological innovation, changing consumer preferences and non-traditional competitors. There can be no assurance that our customers&#8217; businesses will remain competitive with e-commerce providers in the future; any failure to do so would impair their ability to meet their lease obligations to us and materially and adversely affect us. 

Geographic, market sector or industry concentrations within our portfolio may negatively affect our financial results. 

Our operating performance is impacted by the economic conditions affecting the specific locales, market sectors and industries in which we have concentrations of properties. As a result of these concentrations, local economic, market sector, and industry conditions, changes in state or local governmental rules and regulations, acts of nature, epidemics, pandemics and public health crises and actions taken in response thereto, and other factors affecting those states, market sectors or industries could result in an adverse effect on our customers&#8217; businesses and their ability to meet their obligations to us. Additionally, a failure to increase demand for our products by, among other ways, failing to convince middle-market and larger companies to sell and lease back their properties, or an increase in the availability of properties for rent, could materially and adversely affect us. As we continue to acquire properties, our portfolio may become more concentrated by customer, industry or geographic area. A less diverse portfolio could cause us to be more sensitive to the bankruptcy of fewer customers, changes in consumer trends of a particular industry and a general economic downturn in a particular geographic area. 

Failure of our underwriting and risk management procedures to accurately evaluate a potential customer&#8217;s credit risk could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial position. 

Our success depends in part on the creditworthiness of our middle-market and larger customers who generally are not rated by any nationally recognized rating agency. We analyze creditworthiness using Moody&#8217;s Analytics RiskCalc, our methodology of estimating probability of lease rejection and our proprietary &#8216;Probability of Default&#8217; model, each of which may fail to adequately assess a particular customer&#8217;s default risk. An expected default frequency (&#8220;EDF&#8221;) score from Moody&#8217;s Analytics RiskCalc lacks the extensive company participation required to obtain a credit rating published by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization such as Moody&#8217;s Investors Services, Inc. or S&#38;P Global Ratings, a division of S&#38;P Global, Inc., and may not be as indicative of creditworthiness. Substantially all of our customers are required to provide corporate-level financial information to us periodically or at our request. EDF scores and the financial ratios we calculate are based on unverified financial information from our customers, may reflect only a limited operating history and include various estimates and judgments made by the party preparing the financial information. The probability of lease rejection we assign to a particular investment may be inaccurate and may not incorporate significant risks of which we are unaware, which may cause us to invest in properties and lease them to customers who ultimately default, and we may be unable to recover our investment by re-leasing or selling the related property, on favorable terms, or at all. 

We may be unable to identify and complete acquisitions of suitable properties, which may impede our growth. 

Our ability to continue to acquire properties we believe to be suitable and compatible with our growth strategy may be constrained by numerous factors, including the following: 

&#8226; We may be unable to locate properties that will produce a sufficient spread between our cost of capital and the lease rate we can obtain from a customer, which will decrease our profitability. 

&#8226; Our ability to grow requires that we overcome many customers&#8217; preference to own, rather than lease, their real estate and convince customers that it is in their best interests to lease, rather than own, their properties, either of which we may not be able to accomplish. 

&#160; 

&#8226; We may be unable to reach an agreement with a potential customer due to failed negotiations or our discovery of previously unknown matters, conditions or liabilities during our real property, legal and financial due diligence review with respect to a transaction and may be forced to abandon the opportunity after incurring significant costs and diverting management&#8217;s attention. 

&#8226; We may fail to obtain sufficient financing to complete acquisitions on favorable terms or at all. 

We typically acquire only a small percentage of all properties that we evaluate (which we refer to as our &#8220;pipeline&#8221;). To the extent any of the foregoing decreases our pipeline or otherwise impacts our ability to continue to acquire suitable properties, our ability to grow our business will be adversely affected. 

We face significant competition for customers, which may negatively impact the occupancy and rental rates of our properties, reduce the number of acquisitions we are able to complete or increase the cost of these acquisitions. 

We compete with numerous developers, owners and operators of properties that often own similar properties in similar markets, and if our competitors offer lower rents than we are offering, we may be pressured to lower our rents or to offer more substantial rent abatements, customer improvements, early termination rights, below-market renewal options or other lease incentive payments in order to remain competitive. Competition for customers could negatively impact the occupancy and rental rates of STORE properties. 

We also face competition for acquisitions of real property from investors, including traded and non-traded public REITs, private equity investors and other institutional investment funds, as well as private wealth management advisory firms, some of which have greater financial resources, a greater ability to borrow funds to acquire properties, the ability to offer more attractive terms to prospective customers and the willingness to accept greater risk or lower returns than we can prudently manage. This competition may increase the demand for STORE Properties and, therefore, reduce the number of, or increase the price for, suitable acquisition opportunities, all of which could materially and adversely affect us. 

As leases expire, we may be unable to renew those leases or re-lease the space on favorable terms or at all. 

We may not be able to renew leases or re-lease spaces without interruptions in rental revenue, at or above our current rental rates or without offering substantial rent abatements, customer improvement allowances, early termination rights or below market renewal options, and the terms of renewal, extension or re-lease may be less favorable to us than the prior lease. Because some of our properties are specifically designed for a particular customer&#8217;s business, we may be required to renovate the property, decrease the rent we charge or provide other concessions in order to lease the property to another prospective customer. If we need to sell such properties, we may have difficulty selling them to a third party due to the property&#8217;s unique design. 

Some of our customers operate under franchise or license agreements, which, if terminated or not renewed prior to the expiration of their leases with us, would likely impair their ability to pay us rent. 

Some of our customers operate their businesses under franchise or license agreements, which generally have terms that end earlier than the respective expiration dates of the related leases. In addition, a customer&#8217;s rights as a franchisee or licensee typically may be terminated by the franchisor or licensor and the customer may be precluded from competing with the franchisor or licensor upon termination. A franchisor&#8217;s or licensor&#8217;s termination or refusal to renew a franchise or license agreement would impact the customer&#8217;s ability to make payments under its lease or loan with us. We typically have no notice or cure rights with respect to such a termination and have no rights to assignment of any such agreement, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to mitigate losses arising from a default by a terminated franchisee on any of our leases or loans. 

If a customer defaults under either the ground lease or mortgage loan of a hybrid lease, we may be required to undertake foreclosure proceedings on the mortgage before we can re-lease or sell the property. 

In certain circumstances, we may enter into hybrid leases with customers. A hybrid lease is a modified sale-leaseback transaction, where the customer sells us land and then we lease the land back to the customer under a ground lease and simultaneously make a mortgage loan to the customer secured by the improvements the customer continues to own. If a customer defaults under a hybrid lease, we may: (i) evict the customer under the ground lease and assume ownership of the improvements; or (ii) if required by a court, foreclose on the mortgage loan that is secured by the improvements. Under a ground lease, we, as the ground lessor, generally become the owner of the improvements on the land at lease maturity or if the customer defaults. If, upon default, a court requires us to foreclose on the mortgage, rather than evicting the customer, we might encounter delays and expenses in obtaining possession of the improvements, which in turn could delay our ability to promptly sell or re-lease the property. 

&#160; 

Defaults by customers on mortgages we hold could lead to losses on our investments. 

From time to time, we make or assume commercial mortgage loans. We have also made a limited number of investments on properties we own or finance in the form of loans secured by equipment or other fixtures owned by our customers. In the event of a default, we would not earn interest or receive a return of the principal of our loan and may also experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as lender. Foreclosure and other similar proceedings used to enforce payment of real estate loans are generally subject to principles of equity, which are designed to relieve the indebted party from the legal effect of that party&#8217;s default. Foreclosure and other similar laws may limit our right to obtain a deficiency judgment against the defaulting party after a foreclosure or sale, and may lead to a loss or delay in the payment on loans we hold. If we do have to foreclose on a property, we may receive less in the foreclosure sale than the amount the customer owes us or that is needed to cover the costs to foreclose, repossess and sell the property. 

Some of our customers rely on government funding, and their failure to continue to qualify for such funding could adversely impact their ability to make timely lease payments to us. 

Some of our customers operate businesses that depend on government funding or reimbursements, such as customers in the education, healthcare and childcare related industries, which may require them to satisfy certain licensure or certification requirements in order to qualify for these government payments. The amount and timing of these government payments depend on various factors that often are beyond our or our customers&#8217; control. If these customers fail to receive necessary government funding or fail to comply with related regulations, their cash flow could be materially affected, which may cause them to default on their leases and adversely impact our business. 

Construction and renovation risks could adversely affect our profitability. 

In certain instances, we provide financing to our customers for the construction and/or renovation of their properties. We are therefore subject to the risk that this construction or renovation may not be completed. Construction and renovation costs for a property may exceed a customer&#8217;s original estimates due to increased costs of materials or labor, or other unexpected costs. A customer may also be unable to complete construction or renovation of a property on schedule, which could result in increased debt service expenses or construction costs. These additional expenses may affect the ability of the customer to make payments to us. 

Our ability to fully control the maintenance of our net-leased properties may be limited. 

Because our customers are the tenants of our net-leased properties and are responsible for the day-to-day maintenance and management of our properties, after lease expiration, we may incur expenses for deferred maintenance or other liabilities if a property is not adequately maintained. We visit our properties periodically, but these visits are not comprehensive inspections and deferred maintenance items may go unnoticed. Our leases generally provide for recourse against a customer in these instances, but bankrupt or financially troubled customers may be more likely to defer maintenance, and it may be more difficult to enforce remedies against such customers. We may not always be able to ascertain the financial circumstances of a given customer or forestall deterioration in the condition of a property. 

Failure to qualify as a REIT could adversely affect our financial condition. 

Our qualification as a REIT requires us to satisfy numerous highly technical and complex requirements for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations, and which involve the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. No guarantee can be made that we will be able to continue to be qualified as a REIT in the future. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax (and state and local taxes) on our taxable income at the regular corporate rate and be unable to deduct dividends when computing our taxable income. Also, unless the Internal Revenue Service granted us relief under certain statutory provisions, we could not re-elect REIT status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we first failed to qualify as a REIT. The additional tax liability from such a failure could adversely affect our financial condition. 

To the extent state taxing authorities treat us as a &#8220;captive&#8221; REIT, our state income tax obligations may increase and we will be required to calculate deferred income taxes attributable to temporary differences between tax and financial reporting. 

Following the Merger, the Company's new ownership structure and status as a privately held REIT caused multiple state income tax jurisdictions to view the Company as a &#8220;captive&#8221; REIT, a term which generally refers to a REIT of which 50% of the voting power or value of the beneficial interest or shares is owned by a single entity treated as an association taxable as a corporation. Within the jurisdictions where the Company is treated as a captive REIT, the dividends paid deduction may be disallowed, resulting in state income tax liabilities to which the Company was not previously subject when it was publicly traded. Based on the projected increase 

&#160; 

in income tax liabilities related to STORE Capital's new status as a captive REIT in multiple state tax jurisdictions, the Company, in addition to its existing obligation to compute current income tax expense, is now in a position where it needs to calculate deferred income taxes attributable to its temporary differences. While current income taxes are based upon the current period's income taxable for state tax reporting purposes, deferred income taxes (benefits) are provided for certain income and expenses, which are recognized in different periods for tax and financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed for differences between the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and tax basis of assets and liabilities that could result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the period in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. The additional tax liability may impact the operations of the business. 

Risks Related to the Financing of Our Business 

Our growth depends on external sources of debt and equity capital, which are outside of our control and affect our ability to seize strategic opportunities, satisfy debt obligations and make distributions to our members. 

We rely on third-party sources to fund our debt and equity capital needs. Our access to third-party sources of capital depends, in part, on general market conditions, the market&#8217;s perception of our growth potential, our current debt levels, our credit ratings, our current and expected future earnings, and our cash flows and cash distributions. 

In addition, in order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we are generally required under the Code to, among other things, distribute annually at least 90% of our net REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gain, and we will be subject to income tax to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and including any net capital gain. Because of these distribution requirements, without access to third-party sources of capital, we may not be able to acquire properties when strategic opportunities exist, meet the capital and operating needs of our existing properties, satisfy our debt service obligations or make the cash distributions to our members necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT. 

Current market conditions, including increases in interest rates, could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing indebtedness or obtain additional financing for growth on acceptable terms or at all. 

In periods during which credit markets experience significant price volatility, displacement and liquidity disruptions, liquidity in the financial markets can be impacted, making financing terms for customers less attractive, and in certain cases, rendering certain types of debt financing unavailable. In such periods, we may be unable to obtain debt financing on favorable terms, or at all, or fully refinance maturing indebtedness with new indebtedness. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to that refinanced indebtedness would increase, and the increased interest rates could cause our interest costs and overall costs of capital to increase. 

Our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if we or our subsidiaries are unable to make required payments on our debt. 

We are subject to risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flows will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest. If we are unable to make debt service payments as required on loans secured by properties we own, a lender could foreclose on the property or properties securing its debt. This could cause us to lose part or all of our investment. In addition, a significant portion of our investment portfolio consists of assets owned by our consolidated, bankruptcy remote, special purpose entity subsidiaries (&#8220;SPEs&#8221;) that have been pledged to secure the long-term borrowings of those SPEs. We or our other consolidated subsidiaries are the equity owners of our SPEs, which entitles us to the excess cash flows after debt service and all other required payments are made on the debt of our SPEs. If our SPEs fail to make the required payments on such indebtedness or fail to maintain the required debt service coverage ratios, distributions of excess cash flows to us may be reduced or suspended and the indebtedness may become immediately due and payable. If our SPEs are unable to pay the accelerated indebtedness, the pledged assets could be foreclosed upon and distributions of excess cash flows to us may be suspended or terminated, which could reduce the value of our portfolio and revenues available for distribution to our members. 

Our hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our risks associated with interest rates and could reduce our overall net return. 

We attempt to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk by entering into long-term fixed-rate financing through the combination of periodic debt offerings under our secured and unsecured debt programs including our STORE Master Funding program, our asset-backed securities conduit, through non-recourse secured borrowings, through insurance company and bank borrowings, by laddering our borrowing maturities and by using leases that generally provide for rent escalations during the term of the lease. However, the weighted average term of our borrowings does not match the weighted average term of our investments, and the methods we employ 

&#160; 

to mitigate our exposure to changes in interest rates involve risks, including the risk that the debt markets are volatile and tend to reflect the conditions of the then current economic climate. Our efforts may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes, which may increase our cost of capital and reduce the net returns we earn on our portfolio. 

We depend on the asset backed securities (&#8220;ABS&#8221;) market for a substantial portion of our long-term debt financing. 

Historically, we have raised a significant amount of long-term debt capital through our STORE Master Funding program, which accesses the ABS market. Our ABS debt is issued by our SPEs, which issue multiple series of investment grade ABS notes from time to time as additional collateral is added to the collateral pool. Our ABS debt is generally non-recourse, but there are customary limited exceptions to recourse for matters such as fraud, misrepresentation, gross negligence or willful misconduct, misapplication of payments, bankruptcy and environmental liabilities. 

We have generally used the proceeds from these ABS financings to repay debt and fund real estate acquisitions. Our obligations under these loans are generally secured by liens on certain of our properties. In the case of our STORE Master Funding program, subject to certain conditions and limitations, we may substitute real estate collateral for assets in the collateral pool from time to time. No assurance can be given that the ABS market or financing facilities with similar flexibility to substitute collateral will be available to us in the future. 

A disruption in the financial markets for ABS debt may affect our ability to obtain long-term debt, which, in turn, may force us to acquire real estate assets at a lower than anticipated growth rate and negatively affect our return on equity. Furthermore, a reduction in the difference, or spread, between the rate we earn on our assets (primarily the lease rates we charge our customers) and the rate we pay on our liabilities (primarily the interest rates on our debt) could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition. 

A downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 

The credit ratings assigned to us and our debt, which are subject to ongoing evaluation by the rating agencies who have published them, could change based upon, among other things, our historical and projected business, prospects, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition, or the real estate industry generally. If any credit rating agency downgrades or lowers our credit rating, places any such rating on a so-called &#8220;watch list&#8221; for a possible downgrading or lowering or otherwise indicates a negative outlook for that rating, it could materially adversely affect the market price of our debt securities, as well as our costs and availability of debt capital. 

The agreements governing some of our indebtedness contain restrictions and covenants which may limit our ability to enter into or obtain funding for certain transactions, operate our business or make distributions to our members. 

The agreements governing some of our indebtedness contain restrictions and covenants, including financial covenants, that limit or will limit our ability to operate our business. These covenants, as well as any additional covenants to which we may be subject in the future because of additional indebtedness, could cause us to forego investment opportunities, reduce or eliminate distributions to our members or obtain financing on less than favorable terms. The covenants and other restrictions under our debt agreements may affect our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens on assets, sell or substitute assets, modify certain terms of our leases, prepay debt with higher interest rates, manage our cash flows and make distributions to our members. Additionally, these restrictions may adversely affect our operating and financial flexibility and may limit our ability to respond to changes in our business or competitive environment, all of which may materially and adversely affect us. 

General Real Estate Risks 

Real estate investments are relatively illiquid and property vacancies could result in significant capital expenditures. 

We may desire to sell a property in the future because of changes in market conditions, poor customer performance or default under any mortgage we hold, or to avail ourselves of other opportunities. We may also be required to sell a property in the future to meet debt obligations or avoid a default. Particularly with respect to certain types of real estate assets, such as movie theaters, that cannot always be sold quickly, we may be unable to realize our investment objective by sale, other disposition or refinancing at attractive prices within any given period of time or may otherwise be unable to complete any exit strategy. In addition, as a REIT, the Code limits our ability to dispose of properties in ways that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies. In particular, the tax laws applicable to REITs effectively require that we hold our properties for investment, rather than primarily for sale in the ordinary course of business, which may cause us to forgo or defer sales of properties that otherwise would be in our best interest. We may be required to invest in the restoration or modification of a property before we can sell it. The inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our property portfolio could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to service our debt and make distributions to our members. 

&#160; 

The loss of a customer, either through lease expiration or customer bankruptcy, may require us to spend significant amounts of capital to renovate the property before it is suitable for a new customer and cause us to incur significant costs in the form of ongoing expenses for property maintenance, taxes, insurance and other expenses. 

Uninsured losses relating to real property may adversely affect our returns. 

Our contracts generally require our customers to maintain insurance customary for similar types of commercial property. Depending on the location of the property or nature of its use, losses of a catastrophic nature may be covered by insurance policies held by our customers with limitations, such as large deductibles or copayments, that a customer may not be able to meet. In addition, factors such as inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations, public safety threats and others may result in insurance proceeds that are insufficient to repair or replace a damaged or destroyed property. In the event of a substantial or comprehensive loss of any of our properties, we may not be able to rebuild such property to its existing specifications without significant capital expenditures, which may exceed any amounts received under insurance policies, due to the upgrades needed to meet zoning and building code requirements. The loss of our capital investment in, or anticipated future returns from, our properties due to material uninsured losses could materially and adversely affect us. 

Environmentally hazardous conditions may adversely affect our operating results. 

Our properties may be subject to known and unknown environmental liabilities under various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to human health and the environment, some of which may impose joint and several liability on certain statutory classes of persons, including owners or operators, for the costs of investigation or remediation of contaminated properties. These laws and regulations apply to past and present business operations on the properties, and the use, storage, handling and recycling or disposal of hazardous substances or wastes. We may be liable regardless of our knowledge of the contamination, the timing of the contamination, the cause of the contamination or the party responsible for the contamination. Our customers generally must indemnify us from all or most environmental compliance costs, but if a customer fails to, or cannot, comply, we may be required to pay such costs. These costs could be substantial, and because these potential environmental liabilities are generally uncapped, these costs could significantly exceed the property&#8217;s value. There can be no assurance that our environmental due diligence efforts will reveal all environmental conditions at the properties in our pipeline. 

Under the laws of many states, contamination on a site may give rise to a lien on the site for clean-up costs. Several states will grant priority to a &#8220;super lien&#8221; for clean-up costs over all existing liens, including those of existing mortgages. If any of the properties on which we have a mortgage are or become contaminated and subject to a super lien, we may not be able to recover the full value of our investment. 

Certain federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances govern the use, removal and/or replacement of underground storage tanks in the event of a release on, or an upgrade or redevelopment of, certain properties. Such laws, as well as common law standards, may impose liability for any releases of hazardous substances associated with the underground storage tanks and may allow third parties to seek recovery from the owners or operators of such properties for damages associated with such releases. 

In a few states, transfers of some types of sites are conditioned upon cleanup of contamination prior to transfer, including in cases where a lender has become the owner of the site through a foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise. If any of our properties in these states are subject to such contamination, we may be subject to substantial clean-up costs before we are able to sell or otherwise transfer the property. Additionally, certain federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances govern the removal, encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials (&#8220;ACMs&#8221;) in the event of the remodeling, renovation or demolition of a building. Such laws, as well as common law standards, may impose liability for releases of ACMs and may impose fines and penalties against us or our customers for failure to comply with these requirements or allow third parties to seek recovery from us or our customers. 

In addition, our properties may contain or develop harmful mold, exposure to which may cause a variety of adverse health effects. Exposure to mold at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold and could subject us to liability if property damage or health concerns arise. 

If we or our customers become subject to any of the above-mentioned environmental risks, we may be materially and adversely affected. 

We may be subject to liabilities and costs associated with the impacts of climate change. 

The impacts of climate change on our properties or operations are highly uncertain and would be particular to the geographic areas in which we operate. Such impacts may result from increased frequency of natural disasters, changes in rainfall and storm 

&#160; 

patterns and intensities, water shortages, changing sea levels, rising energy and environmental costs, and changing temperatures, which may impact our or our tenants&#8217; ability to obtain property insurance on acceptable terms. While most all of our leases are triple-net, and generally impose responsibility on our tenants for the property-level operating costs and require our tenants to indemnify us for environmental liabilities, there can be no assurance that a given tenant will be able to satisfy its payment obligations to us under its lease if climate change adversely impacts a particular property. 

Certain provisions of our leases or loan agreements may be unenforceable, which could adversely impact us. 

Our rights and obligations with respect to our leases, mortgage loans or other loans are governed by written agreements. A court could determine that one or more provisions of such an agreement are unenforceable, such as a particular remedy (including rights to indemnification), a loan prepayment provision or a provision governing our security interest in the underlying collateral of a customer. We could be adversely impacted if, for example, this were to happen with respect to a master lease governing our rights relating to multiple properties. 

General Risk Factors 

We face risks associated with security breaches through cyber-attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise, as well as other significant disruptions of our IT networks and related systems. 

While we do not collect or maintain the types of information that are most often targeted in cyber-attacks, such as credit card data, bank account information, or sensitive personal information, we nevertheless face risks associated with security breaches through cyber-attacks, malware, computer viruses and malicious codes, ransomware, unauthorized access attempts, denial of service attacks, phishing, social engineering, bad actors with access to systems inside our organization, and other significant disruptions of our IT networks and related systems. The risk of a security breach has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. There are also emerging threats that include the use of artificial intelligence (&#8220;AI&#8221;) to automate and enhance cyberattacks, generate sophisticated phishing attempts, bypass traditional security controls, and exploit vulnerabilities more efficiently. AI-powered attacks may increase the speed and complexity of cyber threats, making detection and response more challenging. Our IT networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business, the availability and integrity of our data and our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and security breaches or system interruptions could result in misstated financial reports, violations of loan covenants, missed reporting deadlines, our inability to monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations regarding our qualification as a REIT, unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others, the diversion of management&#8217;s attention and resources to remedy any resulting damages, liability for claims for breach of contract, damages, credits, penalties or termination of leases or other agreements, or damage to our reputation among our customers, lenders, vendors and investors generally. 

We rely on information systems across our operations and corporate functions, in particular our finance and accounting departments, and depend on such systems to ensure payment of obligations, collection of cash, data warehousing to support analytics, and other various processes and procedures, and there can be no assurance that our security efforts will be effective in deterring security breaches or disruptions. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because the techniques, tools and tactics used in such attempted security breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed to not be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers, disaster recovery or other preventative or corrective measures, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely counteract this risk or fully mitigate the harms after such an attack. And as we periodically upgrade our IT systems, we face the risk that these systems may not function properly and expose us to increased cybersecurity breaches and failures, which would expose us to reputational, competitive, operational, financial and business harm, as well as potential litigation and regulatory action. 

We depend on key personnel; the loss of their full service could impair our ability to operate successfully. 

We rely on the experience, efforts and abilities of senior leadership and other key personnel. We cannot guarantee the continued employment of any of the members of our senior leadership team or key personnel, each of whom could be difficult to replace, given their extensive knowledge and experience. The loss of services of one or more members of our senior leadership team, or our inability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, could adversely affect our business and be negatively perceived in the capital markets, diminish our investment opportunities and weaken our relationships with lenders, business partners and customers. 

&#160; 

We are subject to litigation which could materially and adversely affect us. 

From time to time, we are subject to litigation in connection with the ordinary course operation of our business, including instances in which we are named as defendants in lawsuits arising out of accidents causing personal injuries or other events that occur on the properties operated by our customers. We generally seek to have our customers defend and assume liability for such matters involving their properties. In other cases, we may defend ourselves, invoke our insurance coverage or the coverage of our customers, and/or invoke our indemnification rights included in our leases. Resolution of these types of matters against us may result in significant legal fees and/or require us to pay significant fines, judgments or settlements, which, to the extent uninsured or in excess of insured limits, or not subject to indemnification, could adversely impact our earnings and cash flows. We also may become subject to litigation relating to our financing and other transactions. Certain types of litigation, if determined adversely to us, may affect the availability or cost of some of our insurance coverage, which could expose us to increased risks that would be uninsured and materially and adversely impact our ability to attract directors and officers. 

Future federal, state and local rules or regulations may adversely affect our and our customers&#8217; results of operations. 

Compliance with future federal, state and local governmental rules or regulations, or stricter interpretation of existing governmental rules or regulations, may result in new costs, new liabilities, restrictions on current business activities and could cause a material and adverse effect on our and our customers&#8217; results of operation. There is no way to predict what governmental rules or regulations will be enacted in the future, how future rules or regulations will be administered or interpreted or how future rules or regulations will affect our or our customers&#8217; businesses.

&#160;

Investing in our securities involves a number of significant risks. Before you invest in our securities, you should be aware of various risks, including those described below. You should carefully consider these risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K, before you decide whether to make an investment in our securities. The risks set out below are the principal risks with respect to an investment in our securities generally and with respect to a BDC with investment objectives, investment policies, capital structures or trading markets similar to ours. However, they may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or not presently deemed material by us may also impair our operations and performance. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. In such case, our net asset value and the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. 

&#160;

Risks Relating to our Business and Structure 

&#160;

There are significant potential conflicts of interest that could negatively affect our investment returns. 

&#160;

The investment professionals of House Hanover serve, or may serve, as officers, directors, members, or principals of entities that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do, or of investment funds, accounts, or investment vehicles managed by House Hanover. Similarly, House Hanover may have other clients with similar, different or competing investment objectives. In serving in these multiple capacities, they may have obligations to other clients or investors in those entities, the fulfillment of which may not be in the best interests of us or our stockholders.

&#160;

The management fee structure we have with House Hanover may create incentives that are not fully aligned with the interests of our stockholders. 

&#160;

In the course of our investing activities, we will pay management fees to House Hanover. We have entered into an investment advisory agreement with House Hanover that provides that these fees will be based on the value of our net assets. As a result, investors in our common stock will invest on a gross basis and receive distributions on a net basis after expenses, resulting in a lower rate of return than one might achieve through direct investments.

&#160;

Our board of directors is charged with protecting our interests by monitoring how House Hanover addresses these and other conflicts of interests associated with its management services and compensation. While our board of directors is not expected to review or approve each investment decision, borrowing or incurrence of leverage, our independent directors will periodically review House Hanover&#8217;s services and fees as well as its portfolio management decisions and performance of our portfolio. In connection with these reviews, our independent directors will consider whether our fees and expenses (including those related to leverage) remain appropriate. As a result of this arrangement, House Hanover may from time to time have interests that differ from those of our stockholders, giving rise to a conflict.

&#160;

- 9&#160;-

&#160;

&#160;

The involvement of our interested directors in the valuation process may create conflicts of interest. 

&#160;

We expect to make many of our portfolio investments in the form of loans and securities that are not publicly traded and for which no market based price quotation is available. As a result, our board of directors will determine the fair value of these loans and securities in good faith as described below in &#8220;&#8212; Our portfolio investments will be recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors and, as a result, there may be uncertainty as to the value of our portfolio investments.&#8221; In connection with that determination, investment professionals from House Hanover may provide our board of directors with valuations based upon the most recent portfolio company financial statements available and projected financial results of each portfolio company. While the valuation for most portfolio investments will be prepared quarterly by an independent valuation firm with the assistance of the Company&#8217;s Valuation Committee, the ultimate determination of fair value will be made by our board of directors, including our interested directors, and not by such third-party valuation firm. In addition, Mr. Mark DiSalvo, an interested member of our board of directors, has a direct pecuniary interest in House Hanover. The participation of House Hanover&#8217;s investment professionals in our valuation process, and the pecuniary interest in House Hanover by a member of our board of directors, could result in a conflict of interest as House Hanover&#8217;s management fee is based, in part, on the value of our gross assets.

&#160;

The time and resources that House Hanover devote to us may be diverted, and we may face additional competition due to the fact that House Hanover and its affiliates are not prohibited from raising money for, or managing, another entity that makes the same types of investments that we target. 

&#160;

House Hanover and some of its affiliates, including our officers and our non-independent directors, are not prohibited from raising money for, or managing, another investment entity that makes the same types of investments as those we target. For example, House Hanover could seek to raise capital for a private credit fund that will have an investment strategy that is identical to our investment strategy. House Hanover and we may seek exemptive relief from the SEC that would establish a co-investment program with investment funds, accounts and investment vehicles managed by House Hanover; however, there can be no assurance if and when the SEC would grant such relief. In addition, we may compete with any such investment entity for the same investors and investment opportunities.

&#160;

House Hanover&#8217;s liability is limited under the House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement and we have agreed to indemnify House Hanover against certain liabilities, which may lead House Hanover to act in a riskier manner on our behalf than it would when acting for its own account. 

&#160;

Under the House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement, House Hanover has not assumed any responsibility to us other than to render the services called for under that agreement. It will not be responsible for any action of our board of directors by following or declining to follow House Hanover&#8217;s advice or recommendations. Under the House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement, House Hanover, its officers, members and personnel, and any person controlling or controlled by House Hanover will not be liable to us, any subsidiary of ours, our directors, our stockholders or any subsidiary&#8217;s stockholders or partners for acts or omissions performed in accordance with and pursuant to the House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement, except those resulting from acts constituting gross negligence, willful misfeasance, bad faith or reckless disregard of the duties that House Hanover owes to us under the House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement. In addition, as part of the House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to indemnify House Hanover and each of its officers, directors, members, managers and employees from and against any claims or liabilities, including reasonable legal fees and other expenses reasonably incurred, arising out of or in connection with our business and operations or any action taken or omitted on our behalf pursuant to authority granted by the House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement, except where attributable to gross negligence, willful misfeasance, bad faith or reckless disregard of such person&#8217;s duties under the House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement. These protections may lead House Hanover to act in a riskier manner when acting on our behalf than it would when acting for its own account.

&#160;

&#160; 

Our ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates will be restricted, which may limit the scope of investments available to us. 

&#160;

We are prohibited under the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our independent directors and, in some cases, the SEC. Any person that owns, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of our outstanding voting securities will be our affiliate for purposes of the 1940 Act, and we are generally prohibited from buying or selling any security from or to such affiliate without the prior approval of our independent directors. The 1940 Act also prohibits certain &#8220;joint&#8221; transactions with certain of our affiliates, which could include concurrent investments in the same portfolio company, without prior approval of our independent directors and, in some cases, of the SEC. We are prohibited from buying or selling any security from or to any person that controls us or who owns more than 25% of our voting securities or certain of that person&#8217;s affiliates, or entering into prohibited joint transactions with such persons, absent the prior approval of the SEC. As a result of these restrictions, we may be prohibited from buying or selling any security (other than any security of which we are the issuer) from or to any portfolio company of a private fund managed by House Hanover or its affiliates without the prior approval of the SEC, which may limit the scope of investment opportunities that would otherwise be available to us.

&#160;

We may, however, invest alongside House Hanover&#8217;s investment funds, accounts and investment vehicles in certain circumstances where doing so is consistent with our investment strategy as well as applicable law and SEC staff interpretations. For example, we may invest alongside such investment funds, accounts and investment vehicles consistent with guidance promulgated by the SEC staff to purchase interests in a single class of privately placed securities so long as certain conditions are met, including that House Hanover, acting on our behalf and on behalf of such investment funds, accounts and investment vehicles, negotiates no term other than price. We may also invest alongside House Hanover&#8217;s investment funds, accounts and investment vehicles as otherwise permissible under regulatory guidance, applicable regulations and House Hanover&#8217;s allocation policy. This allocation policy provides that allocations among us and investment funds, accounts and investment vehicles managed by House Hanover and its affiliates will generally be made pro rata based on capital available for investment, as determined, in our case, by our board of directors as well as the terms of our governing documents and those of such investment funds, accounts and investment vehicles. It is our policy to base our determinations on such factors as the amount of cash on-hand, existing commitments and reserves, if any, our targeted leverage level, our targeted asset mix and diversification requirements and other investment policies and restrictions set by our board of directors or imposed by applicable laws, rules, regulations or interpretations. We expect that these determinations will be made similarly for investment funds, accounts and investment vehicles managed by House Hanover. However, we can offer no assurance that investment opportunities will be allocated to us fairly or equitably in the short-term or over time.

&#160;

In situations where co-investment with investment funds, accounts and investment vehicles managed by House Hanover, prior to receiving exemptive relief, is not permitted or appropriate, such as when there is an opportunity to invest concurrently in different securities of the same issuer or where the different investments could be expected to result in a conflict between our interests and those of House Hanover&#8217;s clients, subject to the limitations described in the preceding paragraph, House Hanover will need to decide which client will proceed with the investment. House Hanover will make these determinations based on its policies and procedures, which generally require that such opportunities be offered to eligible accounts on an alternating basis that will be fair and equitable over time. Moreover, except in certain circumstances, we will be unable to invest in any issuer in which an investment fund, account or investment vehicle managed by House Hanover has previously invested.

&#160;

We and House Hanover may seek exemptive relief from the SEC to permit greater flexibility to negotiate the terms of co-investments if our board of directors determines that it would be advantageous for us to co-invest with investment funds, accounts and investment vehicles managed by House Hanover in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. We believe that co-investment by us and investment funds, accounts and investment vehicles managed by House Hanover may afford us additional investment opportunities and an ability to achieve greater diversification. Accordingly, if we make an application for exemptive relief, we will seek an exemptive order permitting us to invest with investment funds, accounts and investment vehicles managed by House Hanover in the same portfolio companies under circumstances in which such investments would otherwise not be permitted by the 1940 Act. We expect that such exemptive relief permitting co-investments, if granted, would not require review and approval of each co-investment by our independent directors. There can be no assurance if and when the SEC would grant such relief.

&#160;

You may not receive distributions, or our distributions may not grow over time. 

&#160;

We cannot assure you that we will achieve investment results that will allow us to make a specified level of cash distributions or year-to-year increases in cash distributions. Our ability to pay distributions might be adversely affected by the impact of one or more of the risk factors described in this filing. Due to the asset coverage test applicable to us under the 1940 Act as a BDC, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions. All distributions will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, maintenance of RIC status, compliance with applicable BDC requirements, and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relative from time to time. We cannot assure you that we will make distributions to our stockholders in the future.

&#160;

- 11&#160;-

&#160;

&#160;

We may have difficulty paying required distributions to qualify as a RIC if we recognize income before, or without, receiving cash representing such income. 

&#160;

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we will include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as the accrual of original issue discount. This may arise if we receive warrants in connection with the making of a loan and in other circumstances, or through contracted PIK interest, which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance and due at the end of the loan term. Such original issue discount, which could be significant relative to our overall investment activities, and increases in loan balances as a result of contracted PIK arrangements will be included in income before we receive any corresponding cash payments. We also may be required to include in income certain other amounts that we will not receive in cash.

&#160;

Since we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to distribute at least 90% of our net ordinary income and net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses, if any, to achieve qualification as a RIC. In such a case, we may have to sell some of our investments at times we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or reduce new investment originations to meet these distribution requirements. If we are not able to obtain such cash from other sources, we may continue to fail to qualify as a RIC and thus be subject to corporate-level income tax.

&#160; 

PIK interest payments we receive will increase our assets under management and, as a result, will increase the amount of base management fees payable by us to House Hanover. 

&#160;

Certain of our debt investments may contain provisions providing for the payment of PIK interest. Because PIK interest results in an increase in the size of the loan balance of the underlying loan, the receipt by us of PIK interest will have the effect of increasing our assets under management. As a result, because the base management fee that we pay to House Hanover is based on the value of our gross assets, the receipt by us of PIK interest will result in an increase in the amount of the base management fee payable by us.

&#160;

Our portfolio investments will be recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors and, as a result, there may be uncertainty as to the value of our portfolio investments. 

&#160;

As a BDC, we generally invest in illiquid loans and securities including debt and equity securities of middle-market companies. Under procedures established by our board of directors, we value investments for which market quotations are readily available at such market quotations. We obtain these market values from an independent pricing service or at the mean between the bid and ask prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers (if available, otherwise by a principal market maker or a primary market dealer). Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors. Such determination of fair values may involve subjective judgments and estimates, although we engage independent valuation providers to review the valuation of each portfolio investment that does not have a readily available market quotation quarterly. Investments purchased within 60 days of maturity are valued at cost plus accreted discount, or minus amortized premium, which approximate fair value. With respect to unquoted securities, our board of directors values each investment considering, among other measures, discounted cash flow models, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public and other factors, which are provided by a nationally recognized independent valuation firm. The Company has engaged a third-party valuation firm to perform its independent valuations of the Company&#8217;s Level 3 investments. This valuation firm provides a range of values for selected investments, which is presented to the Valuation Committee to determine the value for each of the selected investments.

&#160;

When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, our board of directors uses the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate and/or assist us in our valuation. Because there is not a readily available market for substantially all of the investments in our portfolio, we value our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material.

&#160;

- 12&#160;-

&#160;

&#160;

With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#9679; Our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by an independent valuation firm, except for those investments where market quotations are readily available; ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#9679; Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with our senior management, our investment advisor, and our auditors; ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#9679; The valuation committee of our board of directors then reviews these preliminary valuations and approves them for recommendation to the board of directors; ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#9679; The board of directors then discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith, based on the input of our investment advisor, the independent valuation firm and the valuation committee. ##TABLE_END 

&#160;

Our common stock is traded on the Over the Counter Pink Market, which may make it more difficult for investors to resell their shares due to suitability requirements. 

&#160;

Our common stock is currently traded on the OTC Market under the symbol &#8220;PIAC&#8221; where we expect it to remain in the foreseeable future. We do not believe that we will become eligible for the OTCQB Market in the foreseeable future because of our inability to meet the required public float restrictions of the OTCQB Market. Broker-dealers often decline to trade in OTC Pink stocks given the markets for such securities are often limited, the stocks are more volatile, and the risk to investors is greater. These factors may reduce the potential market for our common stock by reducing the number of potential investors. This may make it more difficult for investors in our common stock to sell shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of their shares. This could cause our stock price to decline.

&#160;

Our board of directors may change our investment objective, operating policies and strategies without prior notice or stockholder approval. 

&#160;

Our board of directors has the authority, except as otherwise provided in the 1940 Act, to modify or waive certain of our operating policies and strategies without prior notice and without stockholder approval. However, absent stockholder approval, we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC. We cannot predict the effect any changes to our current operating policies and strategies would have on our business, operating results and the market price of our common stock. Nevertheless, any such changes could adversely affect our business and impair our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.

&#160;

Provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law and of our charter and bylaws could deter takeover attempts and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock. 

&#160;

The Maryland General Corporation Law and our charter and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage, delay or make more difficult a change in control of the Company or the removal of our directors. We are subject to the Maryland Business Combination Act, subject to any applicable requirements of the 1940 Act. Our board of directors has adopted a resolution exempting from the Business Combination Act any business combination between us and any other person, subject to prior approval of such business combination by our board of directors, including approval by a majority of our independent directors. If the resolution exempting business combinations is repealed or our board of directors does not approve a business combination, the Business Combination Act may discourage third parties from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating such an offer. Our bylaws exempt from the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act acquisitions of our stock by any person. If we amend our bylaws to repeal the exemption from the Control Share Acquisition Act, the Control Share Acquisition Act also may make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating such a transaction.

&#160;

We have also adopted measures that may make it difficult for a third party to obtain control of us, including authorizing our board of directors to classify or reclassify shares of our stock in one or more classes or series, to cause the issuance of additional shares of our stock and to amend our charter without stockholder approval to increase or decrease the number of shares of stock that we have authority to issue. These provisions, as well as other provisions of our charter and bylaws, may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.

&#160;

- 13&#160;-

&#160;

&#160;

The foregoing provisions are expected to discourage certain coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate first with our board of directors. However, these provisions may deprive a stockholder of the opportunity to sell such stockholder&#8217;s shares of a premium to a potential acquirer. We believe that the benefits of these provisions outweigh the potential disadvantages of discouraging any such acquisition proposals because, among other things, the negotiation of such proposals may improve their terms. Our board of directors has considered both the positive and negative effects of the foregoing provisions and determined that they are in the best interests of our stockholders.

&#160;

House Hanover can resign as our investment advisor and administrator upon 60 days&#8217; notice and we may not be able to find suitable replacements within that time, or at all, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations. 

&#160;

House Hanover has the right under the House Hanover Investment Advisory Agreement to resign as our investment adviser and administrator at any time upon 60 days&#8217; written notice, whether we have found a replacement or not. If House Hanover was to resign, we may not be able to find a new investment adviser or administrator or hire internal management with similar expertise and ability to provide the same or equivalent services on acceptable terms within 60 days, or at all. If we are unable to do so quickly, our operations are likely to experience a disruption, our financial condition, business and results of operations as well as our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders are likely to be adversely affected and the market price of our shares may decline. In addition, the coordination of our internal management and investment or administrative activities, as applicable, is likely to suffer if we are unable to identify and reach an agreement with a single institution or group of executives having the expertise possessed by House Hanover. Even if we are able to retain comparable management, whether internal or external, the integration of such management and their lack of familiarity with our investment objective may result in additional costs and time delays that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

&#160;

The impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had and will continue to have on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flow. 

&#160;

The global economy has been effected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the small and medium sized businesses in which we are invested. The extent to which our operations may be impacted will depend largely on future developments, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted, including duration, the restrictions by governmental authorities to operate businesses and the effect that programs, such as the Paycheck Protection Program by the U.S. Small Business Administration, will have.

&#160;

Cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents may adversely affect our business or those of our portfolio companies by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of confidential information and/or damage to business relationships, or those of our portfolio companies, all of which could negatively impact our business, results of operations or financial condition. 

&#160;

A cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our information resources. These incidents may be an intentional attack or an unintentional event and could involve gaining unauthorized access to, use, alteration or destruction of our information systems for purposes of misappropriating assets, obtaining ransom payments, stealing confidential information, corrupting data or causing operational disruption, or may involve phishing. The result of these incidents may include disrupted operations, misstated or unreliable financial data, liability for stolen information, misappropriation of assets, increased cybersecurity protection and insurance costs, litigation and damage to our business relationships. This could result in significant losses, reputational damage, litigation, regulatory fines or penalties, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures and to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from operational and security risks. The costs related to cybersecurity incidents may not be fully insured or indemnified. As our and our portfolio companies&#8217; reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our information systems, both internal and those provided by our Investment Adviser and third-party service providers, and the information systems of our portfolio companies. We, our Investment Adviser and its affiliates have implemented processes, procedures and internal controls to help mitigate cybersecurity risks and cyber intrusions, but these measures, as well as our increased awareness of the nature and extent of a risk of a cyber incident, may be ineffective and do not guarantee that a cyber incident will not occur or that our financial results, operations or confidential information will not be negatively impacted by such an incident.

&#160;

- 14&#160;-

&#160;

&#160;

Third parties with which we do business (including, but not limited to, service providers, such as accountants, attorneys, custodians, transfer agents and administrators, and the issuers of securities in which we invest) may also be sources or targets of cybersecurity or other technological risks. We outsource certain functions and these relationships allow for the storage and processing of our information and assets, as well as certain investor, counterparty and borrower information. While we engage in actions to reduce our exposure resulting from outsourcing, we cannot control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by these third parties and ongoing threats may result in unauthorized access, loss, exposure or destruction of data, or other cybersecurity incidents, with increased costs and other consequences, including those described above. Privacy and information security laws and regulation changes, and compliance with those changes, may also result in cost increases due to system changes and the development of new administrative processes.

&#160;

Risks Relating to our Investments 

&#160;

We may hold the loans and debt securities of leveraged companies that may, due to the significant operating volatility typical of such companies, enter into bankruptcy proceedings. 

&#160;

Leveraged companies may experience bankruptcy or similar financial distress. The bankruptcy process has a number of significant inherent risks. Many events in a bankruptcy proceeding are the product of contested matters and adversary proceedings and are beyond the control of the creditors. A bankruptcy filing by a portfolio company may adversely and permanently affect that company. If the proceeding is converted to a liquidation, the value of the portfolio company may not equal the liquidation value that was believed to exist at the time of the investment. The duration of a bankruptcy proceeding is also difficult to predict, and a creditor&#8217;s return on investment can be adversely affected by delays until the plan of reorganization or liquidation ultimately becomes effective. The administrative costs in connection with a bankruptcy proceeding are frequently high and would be paid out of the debtor&#8217;s estate prior to any return to creditors. Because the standards for classification of claims under bankruptcy law are vague, our influence with respect to the class of securities or other obligations we own may be lost by increases in the number and amount of claims in the same class or by different classification and treatment. In the early stages of the bankruptcy process, it is often difficult to estimate the extent of, or even to identify, any contingent claims that might be made. In addition, certain claims that have priority by law (for example, claims for taxes) may be substantial.

&#160;

Our investments in private and small and lower middle-market portfolio companies are risky, and we could lose all or part of our investment. 

&#160;

Investments in private and small and lower middle-market companies involve a number of significant risks. Generally, little public information exists about these companies, and we will rely on the ability of House Hanover&#8217;s investment professionals to obtain adequate information to evaluate the potential returns from investing in these companies. If we are unable to uncover all material information about these companies, we may not make a fully informed investment decision, and we may lose money on our investments. Small and lower middle-market companies may have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations under their loans and debt securities that we hold, which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of any collateral and a reduction in the likelihood of our realizing any guarantees we may have obtained in connection with our investment. In addition, such companies typically have shorter operating histories, narrower product lines and smaller market shares than larger businesses, which tend to render them more vulnerable to competitors&#8217; actions and adverse market conditions, as well as general economic downturns. Additionally, middle-market companies are more likely to depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of persons. Therefore, the death, disability, resignation or termination of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on one or more of the portfolio companies we invest in and, in turn, on us. Small and lower middle-market companies also may be parties to litigation and may be engaged in rapidly changing businesses with products subject to a substantial risk of obsolescence. In addition, our executive officers, directors and investment advisor may, in the ordinary course of business, be named as defendants in litigation arising from our investments in portfolio companies.

&#160;

- 15&#160;-

&#160;

&#160;

The lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business. 

&#160;

All of our assets may be invested in illiquid loans and securities, and a substantial portion of our investments in leveraged companies will be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or will otherwise be less liquid than more broadly traded public securities. The illiquidity of these investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments if the need arises. In addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have previously recorded our investments. Also, as noted above, we may be limited or prohibited in our ability to sell or otherwise exit certain positions in our initial portfolio as such a transaction could be considered a joint transaction prohibited by the 1940 Act.

&#160;

We are a non-diversified investment company as defined under the 1940 Act, and therefore we are not limited with respect to the proportion of our assets that may be invested in securities of a single issuer. 

&#160;

We are classified as a non-diversified investment company as defined under the 1940 Act, which means that we are not limited by the 1940 Act with respect to the proportion of our assets that we may invest in securities of a single issuer. Beyond the asset diversification requirements associated with our qualification as a RIC under the Code, we do not have fixed guidelines for diversification. To the extent that we assume large positions in the securities of a small number of issuers or our investments are concentrated in relatively few industries, our net asset value may fluctuate to a greater extent than that of a diversified investment company as a result of changes in the financial condition or the market&#8217;s assessment of the issuer. We may also be more susceptible to any single economic or regulatory occurrence than a diversified investment company.

&#160;

Our failure to make follow-on investments in our portfolio companies could impair the value of our portfolio. 

&#160;

Following an initial investment in a portfolio company, we may make additional investments in that portfolio company as &#8220;follow-on&#8221; investments, in seeking to increase or maintain in whole or in part our position as a creditor or equity ownership percentage in a portolio company, exercise warrants, options or convertible securities that were acquired in the original or subsequent financing, or preserve or enhance the value of our investment.

&#160;

We have discretion to make follow-on investments, subject to the availability of capital resources. Failure on our part to make follow-on investments may, in some circumstances, jeopardize the continued viability of a portfolio company and our initial investment, or may result in a missed opportunity for us to increase our participation in a successful operation. Even if we have sufficient capital to make a desired follow-on investment, we may elect not to make a follow-on investment because we may not want to increase our level of risk, because we prefer other opportunities or because we are inhibited by compliance with BDC requirements of the 1940 Act or the desire to maintain our qualification as a RIC. Our ability to make follow-on investments may also be limited by House Hanover&#8217;s allocation policy.

&#160;

When we do not hold controlling equity interests in our portfolio companies, we may not be able to exercise control over our portfolio companies or to prevent decisions by management of our portfolio companies that could decrease the value of our investments. 

&#160;

If we do not hold controlling equity positions in the portfolio companies included in our portfolio, we will be subject to the risk that a portfolio company may make business decisions with which we disagree, and that the management and/or stockholders of a portfolio company may take risks or otherwise act in ways that are adverse to our interests. Due to the lack of liquidity of the debt and equity investments that we expect to hold in our portfolio companies, we may not be able to dispose of our investments in the event we disagree with the actions of a portfolio company and may therefore suffer a decrease in the value of our investments.

&#160;

- 16&#160;-

&#160;

&#160;

Our portfolio companies may incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, our investments in such companies. 

&#160;

We intend to invest a portion of our capital in second lien and subordinated loans issued by our portfolio companies. The portfolio companies usually have, or may be permitted to incur, other debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, the loans in which we invest. By their terms, such debt instruments may provide that the holders are entitled to receive payment of interest or principal on or before the dates on which we are entitled to receive payments in respect of the loans in which we invest. Also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a portfolio company, holders of debt instruments ranking senior to our investment in that portfolio company would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any distribution in respect of our investment. After repaying senior creditors, a portfolio company may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying its obligation to us. In the case of debt ranking equally with loans in which we invest, we would have to share any distributions on an equal and ratable basis with other creditors holding such debt in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of the relevant portfolio company.

&#160;

Additionally, certain loans that we may make to portfolio companies may be secured on a second priority basis by the same collateral securing senior secured debt of such companies. The first priority liens on the collateral will secure the portfolio company&#8217;s obligations under any outstanding senior debt and may secure certain other future debt that may be permitted to be incurred by the portfolio company under the agreements governing the loans. The holders of obligations secured by first priority liens on the collateral will generally control the liquidation of, and be entitled to receive proceeds from, any realization of the collateral to repay their obligations in full before us. In addition, the value of the collateral in the event of liquidation will depend on market and economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. There can be no assurance that the proceeds, if any, from sales of all of the collateral would be sufficient to satisfy the loan obligations secured by the second priority liens after payment in full of all obligations secured by the first priority liens on the collateral. If such proceeds were not sufficient to repay amounts outstanding under the loan obligations secured by the second priority liens, then we, to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the collateral, will only have an unsecured claim against the portfolio company&#8217;s remaining assets, if any.

&#160;

If we make subordinated investments, the obligors or the portfolio companies may not generate sufficient cash flow to service their debt obligations to us. 

&#160;

We may make subordinated investments that rank below other obligations of the obligor in right of payment. Subordinated investments are subject to greater risk of default than senior obligations as a result of adverse changes in the financial condition of the obligor or economic conditions in general. If we make a subordinated investment in a portfolio company, the portfolio company may be highly leveraged, and its relatively high debt-to-equity ratio may create increased risks that its operations might not generate sufficient cash flow to service all of its debt obligations.

&#160;

Risks Relating to our Common Stock 

&#160; 

Our share ownership is concentrated. 

&#160;

As of March 29, 2024 the Partnerships beneficially own approximately 95% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, the Partnerships will exert significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the assets, as well as any charter amendment and other matters requiring stockholder approval. This concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control and may have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock by discouraging third party investors. In addition, the interests of the Partnerships may not always coincide with the interests of our other stockholders.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s common stock may be subject to the penny stock rules which might make it harder for stockholders to sell. 

&#160;

As a result of our stock price, our shares are subject to the penny stock rules. Because a &#8220;penny stock&#8221; is, generally speaking, one selling for less than $5.00 per share, the Company&#8217;s common stock may be subject to the foregoing rules. The application of the penny stock rules may affect stockholders&#8217; ability to sell their shares because some broker-dealers may not be willing to make a market in the Company&#8217;s common stock because of the burdens imposed upon them by the penny stock rules which include but are not limited to:

&#160;

Section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rules 15g-1 through 15g-6, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell Company securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors.

&#160;

Rule 15g-2 declares unlawful any broker-dealer transactions in penny stocks unless the broker-dealer has first provided to the customer a standardized disclosure document.

&#160;

- 17&#160;-

&#160;

&#160;

Rule 15g-3 provides that it is unlawful for a broker-dealer to engage in a penny stock transaction unless the broker-dealer first discloses and subsequently confirms to the customer the current quotation prices or similar market information concerning the penny stock in question.

&#160;

Rule 15g-4 prohibits broker-dealers from completing penny stock transactions for a customer unless the broker-dealer first discloses to the customer the amount of compensation or other remuneration received as a result of the penny stock transaction.

&#160;

Rule 15g-5 requires that a broker-dealer executing a penny stock transaction, other than one exempt under Rule 15g-1, disclose to its customer, at the time of or prior to the transaction, information about the sales persons compensation.

&#160;

Potential stockholders of the Company should also be aware that, according to SEC Release No. 34-29093, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include (i) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (ii) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (iii) &#8220;boiler room&#8221; practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (iv) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differential and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (v) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequent investor losses.

Investing in our securities involves a number of significant risks. In addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 -K , you should consider carefully the following information before making an investment in our securities. The risk factors described below are the principal risk factors associated with an investment in our securities, as well as those factors generally associated with a business development company with investment objectives, investment policies, capital structure or trading markets similar to ours, including the risks associated with investing in a portfolio of small and developing or financially troubled businesses. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or not presently deemed material by us might also impair our operations and performance. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In such case, our net asset value and the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. 

RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AND STRUCTURE 

Any failure on our part to maintain our status as a BDC would reduce our operating flexibility, including our ability to borrow money. 

If we do not remain a BDC, we might be regulated as a closed -end investment company under the 1940 Act, which would subject us to substantially more regulatory restrictions under the 1940 Act and correspondingly decrease our operating flexibility, including our ability to borrow money.

We are dependent upon Oxford Square Management&#8217;s key management personnel for our future success, particularly Jonathan H. Cohen and Saul B. Rosenthal. 

We depend on the diligence, skill and network of business contacts of the senior management of Oxford Square Management. The senior management, together with other investment professionals, will evaluate, negotiate, structure, close, monitor and service our investments. Our future success will depend to a significant extent on the continued service and coordination of the senior management team, particularly Jonathan H. Cohen, the Chief Executive Officer of Oxford Square Management, and Saul B. Rosenthal, the President and Chief Operating Officer of Oxford Square Management. Neither Mr. Cohen nor Mr. Rosenthal will devote all of their business time to our operations, and both will have other demands on their time as a result of their other activities. Neither Mr. Cohen nor Mr. Rosenthal is subject to an employment contract. The departure of either of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our investment objective. In addition, due to Oxford Square Management&#8217;s relatively small staff size, the departure of any of Oxford Square Management&#8217;s personnel, including investment, accounting and compliance professionals, could have a material adverse effect on us.

Our financial condition and results of operations will depend on our ability to manage our existing portfolio and future growth effectively. 

Our ability to achieve our investment objective will depend on our ability to manage our existing investment portfolio and to grow, which will depend, in turn, on our investment adviser&#8217;s ability to identify, analyze, invest in and finance companies that meet our investment criteria, and our ability to raise and retain debt and equity capital. Accomplishing this result on a cost -effective basis is largely a function of our investment adviser&#8217;s structuring of the investment process, its ability to provide competent, attentive and efficient services to us and our access to financing on acceptable terms.

We and Oxford Square Management, through its managing member, Oxford Funds, will need to continue to hire, train, supervise and manage new employees. Failure to manage our future growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities. 

A large number of entities compete with us to make the types of investments that we make. We compete with a large number of hedge funds and CLO investment vehicles, other equity and non -equity based investment funds, including other BDCs, investment banks and other sources of financing, including traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks and specialty finance companies. Many of our competitors are substantially larger than us and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC. If we are unable to source attractive investments, we may hold a greater percentage of our assets in cash than anticipated, which could impact potential returns on our portfolio. There can be no assurance that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, as a result of this competition, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities from time to time, and we can offer no assurance that we will be able to identify and make investments that are consistent with our investment objective.

Our business model depends to a significant extent upon strong referral relationships with financial sponsors, and the inability of the senior investment professionals of our investment adviser to maintain or develop these relationships, or the failure of these relationships to generate investment opportunities, could adversely affect our business. 

We expect that the principals of our investment adviser will maintain and develop their relationships with financial sponsors, brokers and agents and we will rely to a significant extent upon these relationships to provide us with potential investment opportunities. If the senior investment professionals of our investment adviser fail to maintain their existing relationships or develop new relationships with other sponsors or sources of investment opportunities, we will not be able to grow our investment portfolio. In addition, individuals with whom the senior investment professionals of our investment adviser have relationships are not obligated to provide us with investment opportunities, and, therefore, there is no assurance that such relationships will generate investment opportunities for us. If our investment adviser is unable to source investment opportunities, we may hold a greater percentage of our assets in cash than anticipated, which could impact potential returns on our portfolio.

There will be uncertainty as to the value of our portfolio investments, which may impact our net asset value. 

A large percentage of our portfolio investments are in the form of securities that are not publicly traded. The fair value of securities and other investments that are not publicly traded may not be readily determinable. We value these securities on a quarterly basis in accordance with our valuation policy, which is consistent with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;). Our board of directors utilizes the services of third -party valuation firms to aid it in determining the fair value of certain securities. The board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value in good faith based on the input of our investment adviser and the respective third -party valuation firms. The factors that may be considered in fair value pricing our investments include the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company&#8217;s ability to make payments and its earnings, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons to publicly traded companies, discounted cash flow and other relevant factors. Because such valuations, and particularly valuations of private securities and private companies, are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on estimates, our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these securities existed. Our net asset value could be adversely affected if our determinations regarding the fair value of our investments were materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon the disposal of such securities.

Market conditions affect debt and equity capital markets in the U.S. and abroad and may in the future have a negative impact on our business and operations. 

Equity capital may be difficult to raise because, subject to some limited exceptions which apply to us, as a BDC we are generally not able to issue additional shares of our common stock at a price less than net asset value. In addition, our ability to incur indebtedness (including by issuing preferred stock) is limited by applicable regulations such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, must equal at least 150% immediately after each time we 

incur indebtedness. The debt capital that will be available, if at all, may be at a higher cost and on less favorable terms and conditions in the future. Any inability to raise capital could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments if required. As a result, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded our investments. In addition, significant changes in the capital markets, including periods of extreme volatility and disruption, have had, and may in the future have, a negative effect on the valuations of our investments and on the potential for liquidity events involving our investments. An inability to raise capital, and any required sale of our investments for liquidity purposes, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Further downgrades of the U.S. credit rating, impending automatic spending cuts or another government shutdown could negatively impact our liquidity, financial condition and earnings. 

U.S. debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns have increased the possibility of additional credit -rating downgrades and economic slowdowns, or a recession in the United States. Although U.S. lawmakers passed legislation to raise the federal debt ceiling on multiple occasions, ratings agencies have lowered or threatened to lower the long -term sovereign credit rating on the United States. The impact of this or any further downgrades to the U.S. government&#8217;s sovereign credit rating or its perceived creditworthiness could adversely affect the U.S. and global financial markets and economic conditions. Absent further quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve, these developments could cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise, which may negatively impact our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms. In addition, disagreement over the federal budget has caused the U.S. federal government to shut down for periods of time. Continued adverse political and economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our business is subject to increasingly complex corporate governance, public disclosure and accounting requirements that could adversely affect our business and financial results. 

We are subject to changing rules and regulations of federal and state government as well as the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed. These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC and the NASDAQ Stock Market, have issued a significant number of new and increasingly complex requirements and regulations over the course of the last several years and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to laws enacted by Congress. Our efforts to comply with these requirements have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, an increase in expenses and a diversion of management&#8217;s time from other business activities.

A disruption in the capital markets and the credit markets could negatively affect our business. 

As a BDC, we seek to maintain our ability to raise additional capital for investment purposes. Without sufficient access to the capital markets or credit markets, we may not be able to pursue new business opportunities. Disruptive conditions in the financial industry and the impact of new legislation in response to those conditions could restrict our business operations and could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.

Our ability to grow our business could be impaired by an inability to access the capital markets or to enter into new credit facilities. Reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets, many lenders and institutional investors have reduced or ceased providing funding to borrowers. This market disruption and tightening of credit has led to increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity generally. If we are unable to raise additional equity capital or consummate new credit facilities on terms that are acceptable to us, we may not be able to initiate significant originations.

These situations may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as access to the credit markets, a severe decline in the value of the U.S. dollar, another economic downturn or an operational problem that affects third parties or us, and could materially harm our business. Even though such conditions have improved broadly and significantly over the short -term , adverse conditions in particular sectors of the financial markets could adversely impact our business over the long -term .

Even in the event the value of your investment declines, the Base Fee and, in certain circumstances, the Net Investment Income Incentive Fee will still be payable. 

The Base Fee is calculated as a percentage of our gross assets at a specific time. Accordingly, the Base Fee will be payable regardless of whether the value of our gross assets and/or your investment have decreased. Moreover, a portion of the incentive fee is payable if our net investment income for a calendar quarter exceeds a designated hurdle rate. Although this portion of the incentive fee (the Net Investment Income Incentive Fee) is subject to the Total Return Requirement, the Net Investment Income Incentive Fee may still be payable during a quarter with net capital losses. Accordingly, this portion of our adviser&#8217;s incentive fee may also be payable notwithstanding a decline in net asset value that quarter. In addition, in the event we recognize PIK loan interest or PIK preferred dividends in excess of our available capital, we may be required to liquidate assets in order to pay a portion of the incentive fee. Oxford Square Management, however, is not required to reimburse us for the portion of any fees attributable to accrued deferred loan interest or dividends in the event of a default or other non -payment by the obligor.

Price declines and illiquidity in the corporate debt markets have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, the fair value of our portfolio investments, reducing our net asset value through increased net unrealized depreciation. Any unrealized depreciation that we experience on our loan portfolio may be an indication of future realized losses, which could reduce our income available for distribution and could adversely affect our ability to service our outstanding borrowings. 

As a BDC, we are required to carry our investments at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our Board of Directors. Decreases in fair values of our investments are recorded as unrealized depreciation. Any unrealized depreciation in our loan portfolio could be an indication of a portfolio company&#8217;s inability to meet its repayment obligations to us with respect to the affected loans. This could result in realized losses in the future and ultimately in reductions of our income available for distribution in future periods and could materially adversely affect our ability to service our outstanding borrowings. Depending on market conditions, we may incur substantial losses in future periods, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

PIK interest/dividend payments we receive will increase our assets under management and, as a result, will increase the amount of Base Fee and incentive fees payable by us to our investment adviser. 

Certain of our debt and preferred stock investments contain provisions providing for the payment of contractual PIK interest or dividends. Because PIK interest/dividends results in an increase in the size of the loan/preferred stock balance of the underlying investment, the receipt by us of PIK interest/dividend will have the effect of increasing our assets under management. As a result, because the Base Fee that we pay to our investment adviser is based on the value of our gross assets, the receipt by us of PIK interest/dividend will result in an increase in the amount of the Base Fee payable by us. In addition, any such increase in an investment balance due to the receipt of PIK interest/dividend will cause such investment to accrue interest/dividend on the higher investment balance, which will result in an increase in our pre -incentive fee net investment income and, as a result, a potential increase in incentive fees that are payable by us to our investment adviser.

Our investment adviser is not obligated to reimburse us for any part of the incentive fee it receives that is based on accrued income that we never receive. 

Part of the incentive fee payable by us to our investment adviser that relates to our net investment income is computed and paid on income that may include interest that has been accrued but not yet received in cash, such as market discount, debt instruments with PIK interest, preferred stock with PIK dividends and zero -coupon securities. If a portfolio company defaults on a loan that is structured to provide accrued interest, it is possible that accrued interest previously used in the calculation of the incentive fee will become uncollectible. Our investment adviser will not be under any obligation to reimburse us for any part of the incentive fee it received that was based on accrued income that we never receive as a result of a default by an entity on the obligation that resulted in the accrual of such income.

Our investment adviser can resign on 60 days&#8217; notice, and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement within that time, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations. 

Our investment adviser has the right, under our investment advisory agreement, to resign at any time upon 60 days&#8217; written notice, whether we have found a replacement or not. If our investment adviser resigns, we may not be able to find a new investment adviser or hire internal management with similar expertise and ability to provide the same or equivalent services on acceptable terms within 60 days, or at all. If we are unable to do so quickly, our operations are likely to experience a disruption, our financial condition, business and results of operations as well as our ability to pay distributions are likely to be adversely affected and the market price of our shares may decline. In addition, the coordination of our internal management and investment activities is likely to suffer if we are unable to identify and reach an agreement with a single institution or group of executives having the expertise possessed by our investment adviser and its affiliates. Even if we are able to retain comparable management, whether internal or external, the integration of such management and their lack of familiarity with our investment objective may result in additional costs and time delays that may adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations.

We are permitted to borrow money, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us. 

Borrowings, also known as leverage, magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and, therefore, increase the risks associated with investing in our securities. We may borrow from and issue senior debt securities to banks, insurance companies, and other lenders. Lenders of these senior securities have fixed dollar claims on our assets that are superior to the claims of our common stockholders. If the value of our assets increases, then leveraging would cause the net asset value attributable to our common stock to increase more sharply than it would have had we not leveraged. Conversely, if the value of our assets decreases, leveraging would cause net asset value to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have had we not leveraged. Similarly, any increase in our income in excess of interest payable on the borrowed funds would cause our net income to increase more than it would without the leverage, while any decrease in our income would cause net income to decline more sharply than it would have had we not borrowed. Such a decline could negatively affect our ability to make common stock distribution payments. Leverage is generally considered a speculative investment technique. Our ability to service any debt that we incur will depend largely on our financial performance and will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and competitive pressures. Moreover, as the Base Fee (and a portion of the incentive fee) payable to Oxford Square Management will be payable on our gross assets, including those assets acquired through the use of leverage, Oxford Square Management may have a financial incentive to incur leverage which may not be consistent with our stockholders&#8217; interests. In addition, our common stockholders will bear the burden of any increase in our expenses as a result of leverage, including any increase in the Base Fee (and incentive fee) payable to Oxford Square Management.

Our asset coverage requirement under the 1940 Act for senior securities is 150%, effective as of April 6, 2019. If we incur additional leverage, general interest rate fluctuations may have a more significant negative impact on our investments and investment opportunities than they would have absent such additional incurrence, and, accordingly, may have a material adverse effect on our investment objectives and rate of return on investment capital.

On April 3, 2019, we completed an underwritten public offering of approximately $44.8 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% Unsecured Notes. The 6.25% Unsecured Notes will mature on April 30, 2026, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option on or after April 30, 2022. The 6.25% Unsecured Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.25% per year payable quarterly on January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 31, of each year. The 6.25% Unsecured Notes are our general unsecured obligations, rank equally in right of payment with our future senior unsecured debt, and rank senior in right of payment to any potential subordinated debt, should any be issued in the future.

On May 20, 2021, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of approximately $80.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.50% Unsecured Notes. The 5.50% Unsecured Notes will mature on July 31, 2028, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at the Company&#8217;s option on or after May 31, 2024. The 5.50% Unsecured Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.50% per year payable quarterly on January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 31, of each year. The 5.50% Unsecured Notes are our general unsecured obligations, rank equally in right of payment with our future senior unsecured debt, and rank senior in right of payment to any potential subordinated debt, should any be issued in the future.

##TABLE_END ____________

(1) &#160; Assumes $299.7 million in total assets and $125.3 million in total debt principal outstanding, which reflects our total assets and total debt outstanding as of December 31, 2024, and a cost of funds of approximately 6.26%.

Our portfolio must have an annual return of at least 2.62% in order to cover the annual interest payments on our current borrowings.

If we are unable to comply with the covenants or restrictions in our borrowings, our business could be materially adversely affected. 

Our borrowings may include covenants, among others, that, subject to exceptions, restrict our ability to pay distributions, create liens on assets, make investments, make acquisitions and engage in mergers or consolidations. Complying with these restrictions may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would help us grow our business or are otherwise consistent with our investment objective. These restrictions could also limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs or otherwise restrict corporate activities. In addition, certain covenants or restrictions could limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders in certain circumstances, which could result in us failing to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC and thus becoming subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates (and any applicable state and local taxes).

The breach of any of the covenants or restrictions, unless cured within the applicable grace period, would result in a default under our borrowings that would permit the lender thereunder to declare all amounts outstanding to be due and payable. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness. As a result, any default could have serious consequences to our financial condition. An event of default or an acceleration under any future borrowings also cause a cross -default or cross -acceleration of another debt instrument or contractual obligation, which would adversely impact our liquidity.

The terms of our future borrowings may contractually limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness. 

We will need additional capital to fund new investments and grow our portfolio of investments. We intend to access the capital markets periodically to issue debt or equity securities or borrow from financial institutions in order to obtain such additional capital. We believe that having the flexibility to incur additional leverage could augment the returns to our stockholders and would be in the best interests of our stockholders. Contractual leverage limitations under our future borrowings may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness. An inability on our part to access additional leverage could limit our ability to take advantage of the benefits described above related to our ability to incur additional leverage and could decrease our earnings, if any, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of our shares of common stock.

We may need to raise additional capital to grow because we must distribute most of our income. 

We may need additional capital to fund growth in our investments. We expect to issue equity securities and expect to borrow from financial institutions in the future. A reduction in the availability of new capital could limit our ability to grow. We must distribute at least 90% of our investment company taxable income to our stockholders to maintain our tax treatment as a RIC. As a result, any such cash earnings may not be available to fund investment originations. We expect to borrow from financial institutions and issue additional debt and equity securities. If we fail to obtain funds from such sources or from other sources to fund our investments, it could limit our ability to grow, which may have an adverse effect on the value of our securities. In addition, as a BDC, our ability to borrow or issue preferred stock may be restricted if our total assets are less than 150% of our total borrowings and preferred stock.

Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to, and the way in which we raise additional capital, which may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage. 

Our ability to grow our business requires a substantial amount of capital, which we may acquire from the following sources:

Senior Securities and Other Indebtedness 

We may issue debt securities or preferred stock and/or borrow money from banks or other financial institutions, which we refer to collectively as &#8220;senior securities,&#8221; up to the maximum amount permitted by the 1940 Act. Under the provisions of the 1940 Act, we are permitted, as a BDC, to issue senior securities in amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 150% immediately after each issuance of senior securities.

This requirement of sustaining a 150% asset coverage ratio limits the amount that we may borrow. Because we will continue to need capital to grow our loan and investment portfolio, this limitation may prevent us from incurring debt. Further additional debt financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, or may be restricted by the terms of our debt facilities. If we are unable to incur additional debt, we may be required to raise additional equity at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so.

As a result of the issuance of senior securities, including preferred stock and debt securities, we are exposed to typical risks associated with leverage, including an increased risk of loss and an increase in expenses, which are ultimately borne by our common stockholders. Because we may incur leverage to make investments, a decrease in the value of our investments would have a greater negative impact on the value of our common stock. When we issue debt securities or preferred stock, it is likely that such securities will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. In addition, such securities may be rated by rating agencies, and in obtaining a rating for such securities, we may be required to abide by operating and investment guidelines that could further restrict our operating flexibility. Refer to &#8220;&#8212; We are permitted to borrow money, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us&#8221; for a description of our outstanding senior securities.

Our ability to pay distributions or issue additional senior securities may be restricted if our asset coverage ratio is not at least 150%. If the value of our assets declines, we may be unable to satisfy this test. If that happens, we may be required to sell a portion of our investments and, depending on the nature of our leverage, repay a portion of our indebtedness at a time when such sales may be disadvantageous. Furthermore, any amounts that we use to service our indebtedness would not be available for distributions to our common stockholders.

Common Stock 

We are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then -current net asset value of our common stock if our Board of Directors determines that such sale is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale.

In certain limited circumstances, we may also issue shares at a price below net asset value in connection with a transferable rights offering so long as: (1) the offer does not discriminate among stockholders; (2) we use our best efforts to ensure an adequate trading market exists for the rights; and (3) the ratio of the offering does not exceed one new share for each three rights held. If we raise additional funds by issuing more common stock or senior securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, our common stock, the percentage ownership of our stockholders at that time would decrease and they may experience dilution. Moreover, we can offer no assurance that we will be able to issue and sell additional equity securities in the future, on favorable terms or at all.

Our Board of Directors is authorized to reclassify any unissued shares of common stock into one or more classes of preferred stock, which could convey special rights and privileges to its owners. 

Our charter permits our Board of Directors to reclassify any authorized but unissued shares of stock into one or more classes of preferred stock. We are currently authorized to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 69,789,527 shares are issued and outstanding as of February 27, 2025. In the event our Board of Directors opts to reclassify a portion of our unissued shares of common stock into a class of preferred stock, those preferred 

shares would have a preference over our common stock with respect to distributions and liquidation. The cost of any such reclassification would be borne by our existing common stockholders. The class voting rights of any preferred shares we may issue could make it more difficult for us to take some actions that may, in the future, be proposed by our Board of Directors and/or the holders of our common stock, such as a merger, exchange of securities, liquidation, or alteration of the rights of a class of our securities, if these actions were perceived by the holders of preferred shares as not in their best interests. The issuance of preferred shares convertible into shares of common stock might also reduce the net income and net asset value per share of our common stock upon conversion. These effects, among others, could have an adverse effect on your investment in our common stock.

A change in interest rates may adversely affect our profitability and we may expose ourselves to risks if we engage in hedging transactions to mitigate changes in interest rates. 

Currently, all of the debt investments in our investment portfolio are at variable rates. In addition, our CLO equity investments are sensitive to risks associated with changes in interest rates. Although we have not done so in the past, we may in the future choose to hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, forward contracts, options and interest rate swaps, caps, collars and floors to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in market interest rates. Hedging against a decline in the values of our portfolio positions does not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the values of such positions or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline. However, such hedging can establish other positions designed to gain from those same developments, thereby offsetting the decline in the value of such portfolio positions. Such hedging transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the values of the underlying portfolio positions should increase. It may not be possible to hedge against an interest rate fluctuation that is so generally anticipated that we are not able to enter into a hedging transaction at an acceptable price.

The success of our hedging transactions will depend on our ability to correctly predict movements in interest rates. Therefore, while we may enter into such transactions to seek to reduce interest rate risks, unanticipated changes in interest rates may result in poorer overall investment performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions. In addition, the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in a hedging strategy and price movements in the portfolio positions being hedged may vary. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the portfolio holdings being hedged. Any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss. To the extent we engage in hedging transactions, we also face the risk that counterparties to the derivative instruments we hold may default, which may expose us to unexpected losses from positions where we believed that our risk had been appropriately hedged. These activities may limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the hedged portfolio. Adverse developments resulting from changes in interest rates or hedging transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, we have limited experience in entering into hedging transactions, and we will initially have to purchase or develop such expertise if we choose to employ hedging strategies in the future.

Our ability to enter into transactions involving derivatives and financial commitment transactions may be limited. 

Through comprehensive new global regulatory regimes impacting derivatives ( e.g. , the Dodd -Frank Act, European Market Infrastructure Regulation (&#8220;EMIR&#8221;), Markets in Financial Investments Regulation (&#8220;MIFIR&#8221;)/Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (&#8220;MIFID II&#8221;)), certain over -the-counter derivatives transactions in which we may engage are either now or will soon be subject to various requirements, such as mandatory central clearing of transactions which include additional margin requirements and in certain cases trading on electronic platforms, pre -and post -trade transparency reporting requirements and mandatory bi -lateral exchange of initial margin for non -cleared swaps. The Dodd -Frank Act also created new categories of regulated market participants, such as &#8220;swap dealers,&#8221; &#8220;security -based swap dealers,&#8221; &#8220;major swap participants,&#8221; and &#8220;major security -based swap participants&#8221; who are subject to significant new capital, registration, recordkeeping, reporting, disclosure, business conduct and other regulatory requirements. The European Unions (&#8220;EU&#8221;) and some other jurisdictions are implementing similar requirements. Because these requirements are new and evolving (and some of the rules are not yet final), their ultimate impact remains unclear. However, even if the Company itself is not located in a particular jurisdiction or directly subject to the jurisdiction&#8217;s derivatives regulations, we may still be impacted to the extent we enter into a derivatives transaction with a regulated market participant or counterparty that is organized in that jurisdiction or otherwise subject to that jurisdiction&#8217;s derivatives regulations.

Based on information available as of the date of this annual report on Form 10 -K , the effect of such requirements will be likely to (directly or indirectly) increase our overall costs of entering into derivatives transactions. In particular, new margin requirements, position limits and significantly higher capital charges resulting from new global capital regulations, even if not directly applicable to us, may cause an increase in the pricing of derivatives transactions entered into by market participants to whom such requirements apply or affect our overall ability to enter into derivatives transactions with certain counterparties. Such new global capital regulations and the need to satisfy the various requirements by counterparties are resulting in increased funding costs, increased overall transaction costs, and significantly affecting balance sheets, thereby resulting in changes to financing terms and potentially impacting our ability to obtain financing. Administrative costs, due to new requirements such as registration, recordkeeping, reporting, and compliance, even if not directly applicable to us, may also be reflected in our derivatives transactions. New requirements to trade certain derivatives transactions on electronic trading platforms and trade reporting requirements may lead to (among other things) fragmentation of the markets, higher transaction costs or reduced availability of derivatives, and/or a reduced ability to hedge, all of which could adversely affect the performance of certain of our trading strategies. In addition, changes to derivatives regulations may impact the tax and/or accounting treatment of certain derivatives, which could adversely impact us.

In November 2020, the SEC adopted new rules regarding the ability of a BDC (or a registered investment company) to use derivatives and other transactions that create future payment or delivery obligations. BDCs that use derivatives would be subject to a value -at-risk leverage limit, certain other derivatives risk management program and testing requirements and requirements related to board reporting. These new requirements would apply unless the BDC qualified as a &#8220;limited derivatives user,&#8221; as defined in the SEC&#8217;s adopted rules. The Company intends to operate under the limited derivatives user exemption of Rule 18f -4 and has adopted written policies and procedures reasonably designed to manage the Company&#8217;s derivatives risk pursuant to Rule 18f -4 . A BDC that enters into reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions would need to aggregate the amount of indebtedness associated with the reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions could either (i) comply with the asset coverage requirements of the Section 18 of the 1940 Act when engaging in reverse repurchase agreements or (ii) choose to treat such agreements as derivative transactions under the adopted rule. Under the adopted rule, a BDC may enter into an unfunded commitment agreement that is not a derivatives transaction, such as an agreement to provide financing to a portfolio company, if the BDC has a reasonable belief, at the time it enters into such an agreement, that it will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet its obligations with respect to all of its unfunded commitment agreements, in each case as it becomes due. If the BDC cannot meet this test, it is required to treat unfunded commitments as a derivatives transaction subject to the requirements of the rule. Collectively, these requirements may limit our ability to use derivatives and/or enter into certain other financial contracts.

There are significant potential conflicts of interest between the Company and its management team. 

In the course of our investing activities, we pay management and incentive fees to Oxford Square Management, and reimburse Oxford Funds for certain expenses it incurs on our behalf. As a result, investors in our common stock invest on a &#8220;gross&#8221; basis and receive distributions on a &#8220;net&#8221; basis after expenses, resulting in, among other things, a lower rate of return than one might achieve through direct investments. As a result of this arrangement, there may be times when the management team of Oxford Square Management has interests that differ from those of our stockholders, giving rise to a conflict.

Oxford Square Management receives a quarterly incentive fee based, in part, on our &#8220;Pre -Incentive Fee Net Investment Income,&#8221; if any, for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. This incentive fee is subject to a quarterly hurdle rate before providing an incentive fee return to Oxford Square Management. To the extent we or Oxford Square Management are able to exert influence over our portfolio companies, the quarterly pre -incentive fee may provide Oxford Square Management with an incentive to induce our portfolio companies to accelerate or defer interest or other obligations owed to us from one calendar quarter to another.

In addition, our executive officers and directors, and the executive officers of Oxford Square Management, and its managing member, Oxford Funds, serve or may serve as officers and directors of entities that operate in a line of business similar to our own. Accordingly, they may have obligations to investors in those entities, the fulfillment of which might not be in the best interests of us or our stockholders. Charles M. Royce, a member of our Board of Directors, holds a minority, non -controlling interest in our investment adviser.

Messrs. Cohen and Rosenthal currently serve as Chief Executive Officer and President, respectively, of Oxford Lane Capital Corp., a non -diversified closed -end management investment company that currently invests primarily in CLO debt and equity tranches, and its investment adviser, Oxford Lane Management. Messrs. Cohen and Rosenthal also currently serve as Chief Executive Officer and President, respectively, of Oxford Park Income Fund, Inc., a non -diversified closed -end management investment company that invests primarily in equity and junior debt tranches of CLO vehicles, and its investment adviser, Oxford Park Management. Messrs. Cohen and Rosenthal also currently serve as Chief Executive Officer and President, respectively, of Oxford Gate Management, the investment adviser to the Oxford Gate Funds and Oxford Bridge II, LLC. Oxford Bridge II, LLC and Oxford Gate Funds are private funds that invest principally in CLO debt and equity. Oxford Funds is the managing member of Oxford Park Management, Oxford Lane Management and Oxford Gate Management. As a result, certain conflicts of interest may arise with respect to the management of our portfolio by Messrs. Cohen and Rosenthal, on the one hand, and the obligations of Messrs. Cohen and Rosenthal to manage the portfolios of Oxford Lane Capital Corp., Oxford Park Income Fund, Inc., Oxford Bridge II, LLC and the Oxford Gate Funds, respectively, on the other hand. In addition, Bruce L. Rubin, our Chief Financial Officer, Corporate Secretary and Treasurer, currently serves in similar capacities for Oxford Lane Capital Corp. and Oxford Park Income Fund, Inc. Mr. Rubin also currently serves as the Chief Financial Officer and Secretary of Oxford Lane Management, Oxford Square Management, Oxford Gate Management, LLC, Oxford Park Management and Oxford Funds. Further, Mr. Gerald Cummins, our Chief Compliance Officer, currently serves in similar capacities for Oxford Lane Management, Oxford Lane Capital Corp., Oxford Square Management, Oxford Gate Management, Oxford Park Income Fund, Inc. and Oxford Park Management. Because of these possible conflicts of interest, these individuals may direct potential business and investment opportunities to other entities rather than to us or such individuals may undertake or otherwise engage in activities or conduct on behalf of such other entities that is not in, or which may be adverse to, our best interests.

Oxford Square Management, Oxford Lane Management, Oxford Gate Management, and Oxford Park Management are subject to a written policy with respect to the allocation of investment opportunities among the Company, Oxford Lane Capital Corp., Oxford Park Income Fund, Inc., Oxford Bridge II, LLC and the Oxford Gate Funds. Where investments are suitable for more than one entity, the allocation policy generally provides that, depending on size and subject to current and anticipated cash availability, the absolute size of the investment as well as its relative size compared to the total assets of each entity, current and anticipated weighted average costs of capital, and whether the proposed investment is an add -on investment to an existing investment, among other factors, an investment amount will be determined by the adviser to each entity. If the investment opportunity is sufficient for each entity to receive its investment amount, then each entity receives the investment amount; otherwise, the investment amount is reduced pro rata.

On October 13, 2016, we filed an exemptive application with the SEC to permit us to co -invest with funds or entities managed by Oxford Square Management or its affiliates in certain negotiated transactions where co -investing would otherwise be prohibited under the 1940 Act. On June 14, 2017, the SEC issued an order permitting the Company and certain of its affiliates to complete negotiated co -investment transactions in portfolio companies, subject to certain conditions, or the &#8220;Order.&#8221; Subject to satisfaction of certain conditions to the Order, the Company and certain of its affiliates are now permitted, together with any future BDCs, registered closed -end funds and certain private funds, each of whose investment adviser is Oxford Square&#8217;s investment adviser or an investment adviser controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Oxford Square Management, to co -invest in negotiated investment opportunities where doing so would otherwise be prohibited under the 1940 Act, providing the Company&#8217;s stockholders with access to a broader array of investment opportunities. Pursuant to the Order, we are permitted to co -invest in such investment opportunities with our affiliates if a &#8220;required majority&#8221; (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co -investment transaction, including, but not limited to, that (1) the terms of the potential co -investment transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the potential co -investment transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our then -current investment objective and strategies.

In the ordinary course of business, we may enter into transactions with portfolio companies that may be considered related party transactions. In order to ensure that we do not engage in any prohibited transactions with any persons affiliated with us, we have implemented certain policies and procedures whereby our executive officers screen each of our transactions for any possible affiliations between the proposed portfolio investment, us, companies controlled by us and our employees and directors. We will not enter into any agreements unless and 

until we are satisfied that doing so will not raise concerns under the 1940 Act or, if such concerns exist, we have taken appropriate actions to seek board review and approval or exemptive relief for such transaction. Our Board of Directors reviews these procedures on an annual basis.

We have also adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics which applies to our senior officers, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as well as all of our officers, directors and employees. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics requires that all employees and directors avoid any conflict, or the appearance of a conflict, between an individual&#8217;s personal interests and our interests. Pursuant to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, each employee and director must disclose any conflicts of interest, or actions or relationships that might give rise to a conflict. Our Audit Committee is charged with approving any waivers under our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. As required by the NASDAQ Global Select Market corporate governance listing standards, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors is also required to review and approve any transactions with related parties (as such term is defined in Item 404 of Regulation S -K ).

Changes in laws or regulations governing our operations may adversely affect our business. 

Changes in the laws or regulations, or the interpretations of the laws and regulations, which govern BDCs, RICs or non -depository commercial lenders could significantly affect our operations and our cost of doing business. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations and are subject to judicial and administrative decisions that affect our operations, including our loan originations, maximum interest rates, fees and other charges, disclosures to portfolio companies, the terms of secured transactions, collection and foreclosure procedures, and other trade practices. If these laws, regulations or decisions change, or if we expand our business into jurisdictions that have adopted more stringent requirements than those in which we currently conduct business, then we may have to incur significant expenses in order to comply or we may have to restrict our operations. In addition, if we do not comply with applicable laws, regulations and decisions, then we may lose licenses needed for the conduct of our business and be subject to civil fines and criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business results of operations or financial condition.

If we do not invest a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets, we could fail to qualify as a business development company or be precluded from investing according to our current business strategy. 

As a BDC, we may not acquire any assets other than &#8220;qualifying assets&#8221; unless, at the time of such acquisition, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets.

We believe that most of our portfolio investments will constitute qualifying assets. However, we may be precluded from investing in what we believe are attractive investments if such investments are not qualifying assets for purposes of the 1940 Act. If we do not invest a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets, we could lose our status as a BDC, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, these rules could prevent us from making follow -on investments in existing portfolio companies (which could result in the dilution of our position) or could require us to dispose of investments at inappropriate times in order to comply with the 1940 Act. If we need to dispose of such investments quickly, it would be difficult to dispose of such investments on favorable terms. For example, we may have difficulty in finding a buyer and, even if we do find a buyer, we may have to sell the investments at a substantial loss.

Provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law and of our charter and bylaws could deter takeover attempts and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock. 

The Maryland General Corporation Law and our charter and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage, delay or make more difficult a change in control of the Company or the removal of our directors. We are subject to the Maryland Business Combination Act, subject to any applicable requirements of the 1940 Act. Our Board of Directors has adopted a resolution exempting from the Business Combination Act any business combination between us and any other person, subject to prior approval of such business combination by our board, including approval by a majority of our disinterested directors. If the resolution exempting business combinations is repealed or our board does not approve a business combination, the Business Combination Act may discourage third parties from trying to acquire control of us and increases the difficulty of consummating such an offer. Our bylaws exempt from the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act acquisitions of our stock by any person. If we amend our bylaws to repeal 

the exemption from the Control Share Acquisition Act (in accordance with any applicable law, rules or regulations), the Control Share Acquisition Act also may make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of us and increases the difficulty of consummating such a transaction.

We have also adopted measures that may make it difficult for a third party to obtain control of us, including provisions of our charter classifying our board of directors in three classes serving staggered three -year terms, and authorizing our board of directors to classify or reclassify shares of our stock in one or more classes or series, to cause the issuance of additional shares of our stock and to amend our charter without stockholder approval to increase or decrease the number of shares of stock that we have authority to issue. These provisions, as well as other provisions of our charter and bylaws, may delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.

The foregoing provisions are expected to discourage certain coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate first with our Board of Directors. However, these provisions may deprive a stockholder of the opportunity to sell such stockholder&#8217;s shares at a premium to a potential acquirer. We believe that the benefits of these provisions outweigh the potential disadvantages of discouraging any such acquisition proposals because, among other things, the negotiation of such proposals may improve their terms. Our Board of Directors has considered both the positive and negative effects of the foregoing provisions and determined that they are in the best interest of our stockholders.

Our Board of Directors may change our investment objective, operating policies and strategies without prior notice or stockholder approval. 

Our Board of Directors has the authority to modify or waive certain of our operating policies and strategies without prior notice (except as required by the 1940 Act) and without stockholder approval. However, absent stockholder approval, we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as a BDC. We cannot predict the effect any changes to our current operating policies and strategies would have on our business, operating results and value of our stock. Nevertheless, the effects may adversely affect our business and impact our ability to make distributions.

Our business and operation could be negatively affected if we become subject to any securities litigation or stockholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of our investment strategy and impact our stock price. 

In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company&#8217;s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against such company. Stockholder activism, which could take many forms or arise in a variety of situations, has been increasing in the BDC space. While we are currently not subject to any securities litigation, due to the volatility of our stock price and for a variety of other reasons, we may in the future become the target of additional securities litigation and the subject of additional stockholder activism. If at any time our current Investment Advisory Agreement is terminated we may not be able to find a new investment adviser or hire internal management with similar expertise and ability to provide the same or equivalent services on acceptable terms. If we are unable to do so quickly, our operations are likely to experience a disruption, our financial condition, business and results of operations as well as our ability to pay distributions are likely to be adversely affected and the market price of our shares may decline.

Securities litigation and stockholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs and divert management&#8217;s and our Board of Directors&#8217; attention and resources from our business. Additionally, such securities litigation and stockholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, we may be required to incur significant legal fees and other expenses related to any securities litigation and activist stockholder matters. Further, our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any securities litigation and stockholder activism.

RISKS RELATED TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX 

We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates, if we are unable to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. 

To remain entitled to the tax benefits accorded to RICs under the Code, we must meet certain income source, asset diversification and Annual Distribution Requirements. In order to qualify as a RIC, we must derive each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale of stock or other securities, or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities. The Annual Distribution Requirement for a RIC is satisfied if we distribute at least 90% of our ordinary income and realized net short -term capital gains in excess of realized net long -term capital losses, if any, to our stockholders on an annual basis. Because we use debt financing, we are subject to certain asset coverage ratio requirements under the 1940 Act and financial covenants under loan and credit agreements that could, under certain circumstances, restrict us from making distributions necessary to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement. If we are unable to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify for special tax treatment as a RIC and, thus, may be subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates on all of our income.

To qualify as a RIC, we must also meet certain asset diversification requirements at the end of each quarter of our taxable year. Failure to meet these tests may result in our having to dispose of certain investments quickly in order to prevent the loss of RIC treatment. Because most of our investments will be in private companies, any such dispositions could be made at disadvantageous prices and may result in substantial losses. If we fail to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC for any reason and remain or become subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates, the resulting corporate taxes could substantially reduce our net assets, the amount of income available for distribution and the amount of our distributions. Such a failure would have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders.

Our investments in CLOs may be subject to special anti-deferral provisions that could result in us incurring tax or recognizing income prior to receiving cash distributions related to such income. 

We have purchased and may in the future purchase residual or subordinated interests in CLOs that are treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as shares in a passive foreign investment company or PFIC. If we acquire investments in a PFIC (including equity tranche investments in CLOs that are PFICs), we may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a portion of any &#8220;excess distribution&#8221; or gain from the disposition of such shares. Additional charges, in the nature of interest, generally will be imposed on us in respect of deferred taxes arising from any such excess distribution or gain. This additional tax and interest may apply even if we make a distribution in an amount equal to any &#8220;excess distribution&#8221; or gain from the disposition of such shares as a taxable dividend by us to our stockholders. Certain elections may be available to mitigate or eliminate such tax on excess distributions, but such elections (if available) will generally require us to recognize our share of the PFICs income for each year regardless of whether we receive any distributions from such PFICs. We must nonetheless distribute such income to maintain our tax treatment as a RIC.

If we hold more than 10% of the shares in a foreign corporation that is treated as a controlled foreign corporation or CFC (including equity tranche investments in a CLO treated as CFC), we may be treated as receiving a deemed distribution (taxable as ordinary income) each year from such foreign corporation in an amount equal to our pro rata share of the corporation&#8217;s income for the tax year (including both ordinary earnings and capital gains). If we are required to include such deemed distributions from a CFC in our income, we will be required to distribute such income to maintain our RIC tax treatment regardless of whether or not the CFC makes an actual distribution during such year.

If we are required to include amounts in income prior to receiving distributions representing such income, we may have to sell some of our investments at times and/or at prices we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or forgo new investment opportunities for this purpose. If we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment and thus become subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates.

If we do not receive timely distributions from our CLO investments, we may fail to qualify as a RIC. 

We are required to include in our taxable income our proportionate share of the income of certain CLO investments to the extent that such CLOs are PFICs for which we have made a qualifying electing fund, or &#8220;QEF,&#8221; election or are CFCs. To the extent that such CLOs do not distribute all of their earnings and profits on a current basis, we may fail to satisfy the 90% Income Test and thus fail to qualify as a RIC. Income inclusions from a QEF or a CFC will be &#8220;good income&#8221; for purposes of the 90% Income Test provided that they are derived in connection with our business of investing in stocks and securities or the QEF or the CFC distribute such income to us in the same taxable year to which the income is included in our income.

The CLOs in which we invest may be subject to withholding tax if they fail to comply with certain reporting requirements. 

Legislation commonly referred to as the &#8220;Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act,&#8221; or &#8220;FATCA,&#8221; generally imposes a 30% withholding tax on payments of certain types of income to foreign financial institutions (&#8220;FFIs&#8221;) unless such FFIs either: (i) enter into an agreement with the U.S. Treasury to report certain required information with respect to accounts held by certain specified U.S. persons (or held by foreign entities that have certain specified U.S. persons as substantial owners) or (ii) reside in a jurisdiction that has entered into an intergovernmental agreement (&#8220;IGA&#8221;) with the United States to collect and share such information and are in compliance with the terms of such IGA and any enabling legislation or regulations. The types of income subject to the tax include U.S. source interest and dividends. While the Code would also require withholding on payments of the gross proceeds from the sale of any property that could produce U.S. source interest or dividends, the U.S. Treasury Department has indicated its intent to eliminate this requirement in subsequent proposed regulations, which state that taxpayers may rely on the proposed regulations until final regulations are issued. The information required to be reported includes the identity and taxpayer identification number of each account holder that is a specified U.S. person and transaction activity within the holder&#8217;s account. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, FATCA also imposes a 30% withholding on certain payments to certain foreign entities that are not FFIs unless such foreign entities certify that they do not have a greater than 10% owner that is a specified U.S. person or provide the withholding agent with identifying information on each greater than 10% owner that is a specified U.S. person. Most CLO vehicles in which we invest will be treated as FFIs for this purpose, and therefore will be required to comply with these reporting requirements to avoid the 30% withholding. If a CLO vehicle in which we invest fails to properly comply with these reporting requirements, it could reduce the amounts available to distribute to equity and junior debt holders in such CLO vehicle, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.

We may have difficulty paying our required distributions if we recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income. 

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we will include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as original issue discount (&#8220;OID&#8221;), which may arise if we receive warrants in connection with the making of a loan or possibly in other circumstances, or contracted PIK interest, which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance and due at the end of the loan term. In addition, we may be required to accrue for U.S. federal income tax purposes amounts attributable to our investment in CLOs that may differ from the distributions received in respect of such investments. We also may be required to include in income certain other amounts that we will not receive in cash.

Because in certain cases we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty satisfying the Annual Distribution Requirement applicable to RICs. Accordingly, we may have to sell some of our investments at times we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital, reduce new investments or make taxable distributions of our stock or debt securities to meet that distribution requirement. If we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment and thus be subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates.

In addition, OID income for certain portfolio investments may or may not be included as a factor in the determination of the fair value of such investments.

RISKS RELATING TO OUR INVESTMENTS 

Our investment portfolio may be concentrated in a limited number of portfolio companies, which will subject us to a risk of significant loss if any of these companies defaults on its obligations under any of its debt securities that we hold or if the sectors in which we invest experience a market downturn. 

A consequence of our limited number of investments is that the aggregate returns we realize may be significantly adversely affected if a small number of investments perform poorly or if we need to write down the value of any one investment. Beyond the asset diversification requirements applicable to RICs, we do not have fixed guidelines for diversification, and our investments could be concentrated in relatively few issuers. While we have historically focused on the technology sector, we are actively seeking new investment opportunities outside this sector that otherwise meet our investment criteria. As a result, a market downturn, including a downturn in the sectors in which we invest, could materially adversely affect us.

The lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business. 

As stated above, our investments are generally not in publicly traded securities. Substantially all of these securities are subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or will otherwise be less liquid than publicly traded securities. For example, there is a limited secondary market for any of our investments in warehouse facilities and our investments in warehouse facilities are less liquid than our investments in CLOs. The illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments if the need arises. Also, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have previously recorded our investments.

In addition, because we generally invest in debt securities with a term of up to seven years and generally intend to hold such investments until maturity of the debt, we do not expect realization events, if any, to occur in the near -term . We expect that our holdings of equity securities may require several years to appreciate in value, and we can offer no assurance that such appreciation will occur.

If we cannot obtain additional capital because of either regulatory or market price constraints, we could be forced to curtail or cease our new lending and investment activities, our net asset value could decrease and our level of distributions and liquidity could be affected adversely. 

Our ability to secure additional financing and satisfy our financial obligations under indebtedness outstanding from time to time will depend upon our future operating performance, which is subject to the prevailing general economic and credit market conditions, including interest rate levels and the availability of credit generally, and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. The worsening of current economic and capital market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our ability to secure financing on favorable terms, if at all.

If we are unable to obtain debt capital, then our equity investors will not benefit from the potential for increased returns on equity resulting from leverage to the extent that our investment strategy is successful and we may be limited in our ability to make new commitments or fundings to our portfolio companies.

We are exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates. 

General interest rate fluctuations may have a substantial negative impact on our investments and our investment returns and, accordingly, may have a material adverse effect on our investment objective and our net investment income.

Because we will borrow money and may issue debt securities or preferred stock to make investments, our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds or pay interest or dividends on such debt securities or preferred stock and the rate at which we invest these funds. In periods of rising interest rates, our interest income will increase as the majority of our portfolio bears interest at variable rates while our cost of funds will also increase, which could result in an increase to our net investment income. Conversely, if interest rates decrease, we may earn less interest income from investments and our cost of funds will also decrease, which could result in lower net investment income. From time to time, we may also enter into certain 

hedging transactions to mitigate our exposure to changes in interest rates. However, we cannot assure you that such transactions will be successful in mitigating our exposure to interest rate risk. There can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income.

Rising interest rates may also increase the cost of debt for our underlying portfolio companies, which could adversely impact their financial performance and ability to meet ongoing obligations to us. Also, an increase in interest rates available to investors could make an investment in our shares less attractive if we are not able to pay dividends at a level that provides a similar return, which could reduce the value of our shares.

Subordinated liens on collateral securing debt investments that we will make to our portfolio companies may be subject to control by senior creditors with first priority liens. If there is a default, the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to repay in full both the first priority creditors and us. 

Certain debt investments that we make in portfolio companies will be secured on a second priority basis by the same collateral securing senior debt of such companies. The first priority liens on the collateral will secure the portfolio company&#8217;s obligations under any outstanding senior debt and may secure certain other future debt that may be permitted to be incurred by the portfolio company under the agreements governing the debt. The holders of obligations secured by the first priority liens on the collateral will generally control the liquidation of and be entitled to receive proceeds from any realization of the collateral to repay their obligations in full before us. In addition, the value of the collateral in the event of liquidation will depend on market and economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. We can offer no assurance that the proceeds, if any, from the sale or sales of all of the collateral would be sufficient to satisfy the debt obligations secured by the second priority liens after payment in full of all obligations secured by the first priority liens on the collateral. If such proceeds are not sufficient to repay amounts outstanding under the debt obligations secured by the second priority liens, then we, to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the collateral, will only have an unsecured claim against the portfolio company&#8217;s remaining assets, if any. Similarly, investments in &#8220;last out&#8221; pieces of tranched first lien loans will be similar to second lien loans in that such investments will be junior in priority to the &#8220;first out&#8221; piece of the same tranched loan with respect to payment of principal, interest and other amounts.

We may also make unsecured debt investments in portfolio companies, meaning that such investments will not benefit from any interest in collateral of such companies. Liens on such portfolio companies&#8217; collateral, if any, will secure the portfolio company&#8217;s obligations under its outstanding secured debt and may secure certain future debt that is permitted to be incurred by the portfolio company under its secured debt agreements. The holders of obligations secured by such liens will generally control the liquidation of, and be entitled to receive proceeds from, any realization of such collateral to repay their obligations in full before us. In addition, the value of such collateral in the event of liquidation will depend on market and economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. We can offer no assurance that the proceeds, if any, from sales of such collateral would be sufficient to satisfy our unsecured debt obligations after payment in full of all secured debt obligations. If such proceeds were not sufficient to repay the outstanding secured debt obligations, then our unsecured claims would rank equally with the unpaid portion of such secured creditors&#8217; claims against the portfolio company&#8217;s remaining assets, if any.

The rights we may have with respect to the collateral securing the debt investments we make in our portfolio companies with senior debt outstanding, or first -out pieces of tranched first lien debt, may also be limited pursuant to the terms of one or more inter -creditor agreements that we enter into with the holders of senior debt. Under such an inter -creditor agreement, at any time that obligations that have the benefit of the first priority liens are outstanding, any of the following actions that may be taken in respect of the collateral will be at the direction of the holders of the obligations secured by the first priority liens: the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against the collateral; the ability to control the conduct of such proceedings; the approval of amendments to collateral documents; releases of liens on the collateral; and waivers of past defaults under collateral documents. We may not have the ability to control or direct such actions, even if our rights are adversely affected.

Most of our debt investments will not fully amortize during their lifetime, which may subject us to the risk of loss of our principal in the event a portfolio company is unable to repay us prior to maturity. 

Most of our debt investments are not structured to fully amortize during their lifetime. Accordingly, if a portfolio company has not previously pre -paid its debt investment to us, a significant portion of the principal amount due on such a debt investment may be due at maturity. In order to create liquidity to pay the final principal 

payment, a portfolio company typically must raise additional capital. If it is unable to raise sufficient funds to repay us, the debt investment may go into default, which may compel us to foreclose on the borrower&#8217;s assets, even if the debt investment was otherwise performing prior to maturity. This may prevent us from immediately obtaining full recovery on the debt investment and may prevent or delay the reinvestment of the investment proceeds in other, possibly more profitable investments.

Our portfolio companies may prepay loans, which may reduce our yields if capital returned cannot be invested in transactions with equal or greater expected yields. 

The loans in our investment portfolio may be prepaid at any time, generally with little advance notice. Whether a loan is prepaid will depend both on the continued positive performance of the portfolio company and the existence of favorable financing market conditions that allow such company the ability to replace existing financing with less expensive capital. As market conditions change, we do not know when, and if, prepayment may be possible for each portfolio company. In some cases, the prepayment of a loan may reduce our achievable yield if the capital returned cannot be invested in transactions with equal or greater expected yields, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The application of the risk retention rules to CLOs may have broader effects on the CLO and loan markets in general, potentially resulting in fewer or less desirable investment opportunities for the Company. 

The securitization industry in both European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) and the United Kingdom (&#8220;UK&#8221;) has also undergone a number of significant changes in the past few years. Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 relating to a European framework for simple, transparent and standardized securitization (as amended by Regulation (EU) 2021/557 and as further amended from time to time, the &#8220;EU Securitization Regulation&#8221;) applies to certain specified EU investors, and Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 relating to a European framework for simple, transparent and standardized securitization in the form in effect on 31 December 2020 (which forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended, the &#8220;EUWA&#8221;)) (as amended by the Securitization (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 and as further amended from time to time, the &#8220;UK Securitization Regulation&#8221; and, together with the EU Securitization Regulation, the &#8220;Securitization Regulations&#8221;) applies to certain specified UK investors, in each case, who are investing in a &#8220;securitization&#8221; (as such term is defined under each Securitization Regulation).

The due diligence requirements of Article 5 of the EU Securitization Regulation (the &#8220;EU Due Diligence Requirements&#8221;) apply to each investor that is an &#8220;institutional investor&#8221; (as such term is defined in the EU Securitization Regulation), being an investor which is one of the following: (a) an insurance undertaking as defined in Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009 on the taking -up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (Solvency II) (recast) (&#8220;Solvency II&#8221;); (b) a reinsurance undertaking as defined in Solvency II; (c) subject to certain conditions and exceptions, an institution for occupational retirement provision falling within the scope of Directive (EU) 2016/2341 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2016 on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision (IORPs) (the &#8220;IORP Directive&#8221;), or an investment manager or an authorized entity appointed by an institution for occupational retirement provision pursuant to the IORP Directive; (d) an alternative investment fund manager (&#8220;AIFM&#8221;) as defined in Directive 2011/61/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2011 on Alternative Investment Fund Managers that manages and/or markets alternative investment funds in the EU; (e) an undertaking for the collective investment in transferable securities (&#8220;UCITS&#8221;) management company, as defined in Directive 2009/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) (the &#8220;UCITS Directive&#8221;); (f) an internally managed UCITS, which is an investment company authorized in accordance with the UCITS Directive and which has not designated a management company authorized under the UCITS Directive for its management; or (g) a credit institution as defined in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms (the &#8220;CRR&#8221;) for the purposes of the CRR, or an investment firm as defined in the CRR, in each case, such investor an &#8220;EU Institutional Investor&#8221;.

The due diligence requirements of Article 5 of the UK Securitization Regulation (the &#8220;UK Due Diligence Requirements&#8221; and, together with the EU Due Diligence Requirements, the &#8220;Due Diligence Requirements&#8221;) apply to each investor that is an &#8220;institutional investor&#8221; (as such term is defined in the UK Securitization Regulation), 

being an investor which is one of the following: (a) an insurance undertaking as defined in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (as amended, the &#8220;FSMA&#8221;); (b) a reinsurance undertaking as defined in the FSMA; (c) an occupational pension scheme as defined in the Pension Schemes Act 1993 that has its main administration in the UK, or a fund manager of such a scheme appointed under the Pensions Act 1995 that, in respect of activity undertaken pursuant to that appointment, is authorized under the FSMA; (d) an AIFM (as defined in the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Regulations 2013 (the &#8220;AIFM Regulations&#8221;)) which markets or manages AIFs (as defined in the AIFM Regulations) in the UK; (e) a management company as defined in the FSMA; (f) a UCITS as defined by the FSMA, which is an authorized open ended investment company as defined in the FSMA; (g) a FCA investment firm as defined by the CRR as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of EUWA (the &#8220;UK CRR&#8221;); or (h) a CRR investment firm as defined in the UK CRR, in each case, such investor a &#8220;UK Institutional Investor&#8221; and, such investors together with EU Institutional Investors, &#8220;Institutional Investors&#8221;.

Among other things, the applicable Due Diligence Requirements require that prior to holding a &#8220;securitization position&#8221; (as defined in each Securitization Regulation) an Institutional Investor (other than the originator, sponsor or original lender) has verified that:

(1) &#160; the originator, sponsor or original lender will retain on an ongoing basis a material net economic interest which, in any event, shall be not less than five per cent. in the securitization, determined in accordance with Article 6 of the applicable Securitization Regulation, and has disclosed the risk retention to such Institutional Investor;

(2) &#160; (in the case of each EU Institutional Investor only) the originator, sponsor or securitization special purpose entity (&#8220;SSPE&#8221;) has, where applicable, made available the information required by Article 7 of the EU Securitization Regulation in accordance with the frequency and modalities provided for thereunder;

(3) &#160; (in the case of each UK Institutional Investor only) the originator, sponsor or SSPE:

(i) &#160; if established in the UK has, where applicable, made available the information required by Article 7 of the UK Securitization Regulation (the &#8220;UK Transparency Requirements&#8221;) in accordance with the frequency and modalities provided for thereunder; or

(ii) &#160; if established in a country other than the UK, where applicable, made available information which is substantially the same as that which it would have made available under the UK Transparency Requirements if it had been established in the UK, and has done so with such frequency and modalities as are substantially the same as those with which it would have made information available under the UK Transparency Requirements if it had been established in the UK; and

(4) &#160; in the case of each Institutional Investor, where the originator or original lender either (i) is not a credit institution or an investment firm (each as defined in the applicable Securitization Regulation) or (ii) is established in a third country (being (x) in respect of the EU Securitization Regulation, a country other than an EU member state, or (y) in respect of the UK Securitization Regulation, a country other than the UK), the originator or original lender grants all the credits giving rise to the underlying exposures on the basis of sound and well -defined criteria and clearly established processes for approving, amending, renewing and financing those credits and has effective systems in place to apply those criteria and processes in order to ensure that credit -granting is based on a thorough assessment of the obligor&#8217;s creditworthiness.

The Due Diligence Requirements further require that prior to holding a securitization position, an Institutional Investor, other than the originator, sponsor or original lender, carry out a due diligence assessment which enables it to assess the risks involved, including but not limited to (a) the risk characteristics of the individual securitization position and the underlying exposures; and (b) all the structural features of the securitization that can materially impact the performance of the securitization position, including the contractual priorities of payment and priority of payment -related triggers, credit enhancements, liquidity enhancements, market value triggers, and transaction -specific definitions of default.

Any Institutional Investor that fails to comply with the applicable Due Diligence Requirements in respect of a securitization position which it holds may become subject to a range of regulatory sanctions including, in the case of a credit institution, investment firm, insurer or reinsurer, a punitive regulatory capital charge with respect to such securitization position, or, in certain other cases, a requirement to take corrective action.

To the extent a CLO is structured in compliance with the Securitization Regulations, the Company&#8217;s ability to invest in the CLO equity of such CLOs could be limited, or the Company could be required to hold its investment for the life of the CLO. If a CLO has not been structured to comply with the Securitization Regulations, it will limit the ability of Institutional Investors to purchase CLO securities, which may adversely affect the price and liquidity of the securities (including the CLO equity) in the secondary market. Additionally, the Securitization Regulations and any regulatory uncertainty in relation thereto may reduce the issuance of new CLOs and reduce the liquidity provided by CLOs to the leveraged loan market generally. Reduced liquidity in the loan market could reduce investment opportunities for collateral managers, which could negatively affect the return of the Company&#8217;s investments. Any reduction in the volume and liquidity provided by CLOs to the leveraged loan market could also reduce opportunities to redeem or refinance the securities comprising a CLO in an optional redemption or refinancing and could negatively affect the ability of obligors to refinance their collateral obligations, either of which developments could increase defaulted obligations above historic levels.

The Japanese Financial Services Agency (the &#8220;JFSA&#8221;) published a risk retention rule as part of the regulatory capital regulation of certain categories of Japanese investors seeking to invest in securitization transactions (the &#8220;JRR Rule&#8221;). The JRR Rule mandates an &#8220;indirect&#8221; compliance requirement, meaning that certain categories of Japanese investors will be required to apply higher risk weighting to securitization exposures they hold unless the relevant originator commits to hold a retention interest equal to at least 5% of the exposure of the total underlying assets in the transaction (the &#8220;Japanese Retention Requirement&#8221;) or such investors determine that the underlying assets were not &#8220;inappropriately originated.&#8221; The Japanese investors to which the JRR Rule applies include banks, bank holding companies, credit unions (shinyo kinko), credit cooperatives (shinyo kumiai), labor credit unions (rodo kinko), agricultural credit cooperatives (nogyo kyodo kumiai), ultimate parent companies of large securities companies and certain other financial institutions regulated in Japan (such investors, &#8220;Japanese Affected Investors&#8221;). Such Japanese Affected Investors may be subject to punitive capital requirements and/or other regulatory penalties with respect to investments in securitizations that fail to comply with the Japanese Retention Requirement.

The JRR Rule became effective on March 31, 2019. At this time, there are a number of unresolved questions and no established line of authority, precedent or market practice that provides definitive guidance with respect to the JRR Rule, and no assurances can be made as to the content, impact or interpretation of the JRR Rule. In particular, the basis for the determination of whether an asset is &#8220;inappropriately originated&#8221; remains unclear and, therefore, unless the JFSA provides further specific clarification, it is possible that CLO securities the Company purchases may contain assets deemed to be &#8220;inappropriately originated&#8221; and, as a result, may not be exempt from the Japanese Retention Requirement. The JRR Rule or other similar requirements may deter Japanese Affected Investors from purchasing CLO securities, which may limit the liquidity of CLO securities and, in turn, adversely affect the price of such CLO securities in the secondary market. Whether and to what extent the JFSA may provide further clarification or interpretation as to the JRR Rule is unknown.

We may be subject to risks associated with our investments in covenant-lite loans 

We have made and may in the future make or obtain significant exposure to covenant -lite loans, which generally are loans that do not require a borrower to comply with financial maintenance covenants, and may not include terms that allow the lender to monitor the financial performance of the borrower, including financial ratios, and declare a default if certain financial criteria are breached. While these loans may still contain other collateral protections, a covenant -lite loan may carry more risk than a covenant -heavy loan made by the same borrower as it does not require the borrower to provide affirmation that certain specific financial tests have been satisfied on a routine basis as is generally required under a covenant -heavy loan agreement. Generally, covenant -lite loans permit borrowers more opportunity to negatively impact lenders because their covenants, if any, tend to be incurrence -based , which means they are only tested and can only be breached following certain actions of the borrower, rather than by a deterioration in the borrower&#8217;s financial condition. Our investment in or exposure to a covenant -lite loan may potentially hinder our ability to reprice credit risk associated with the issuer and reduce our ability to restructure a problematic loan and mitigate potential loss. As a result, our exposure to losses may be increased, which could result in an adverse impact on our revenues, net income and net asset value.

Our investments in the companies that we target may be extremely risky and we could lose all or part of our investments. 

Although a prospective portfolio company&#8217;s assets are one component of our analysis when determining whether to provide debt capital, we generally do not base investment decisions primarily on the liquidation value of a company&#8217;s balance sheet assets. Instead, given the nature of the companies that we invest in, we also review the company&#8217;s historical and projected cash flows, equity capital and &#8220;soft&#8221; assets, including intellectual property (patented and non -patented ), databases, business relationships (both contractual and non -contractual ) and the like. Accordingly, considerably higher levels of overall risk will likely be associated with our portfolio compared with that of a traditional asset -based lender whose security consists primarily of receivables, inventories, equipment and other tangible assets. Interest rates payable by our portfolio companies may not compensate for these additional risks, any of which could cause us to lose part or all of our investment.

Specifically, investment in certain of the companies that we are invested in involves a number of significant risks, including:

&#8226; &#160; these companies may have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations under their debt securities that we hold, which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of any collateral and a reduction in the likelihood of us realizing any value from the liquidation of such collateral;

&#8226; &#160; they may have limited operating histories, narrower product lines and smaller market shares than larger businesses, which may tend to render them more vulnerable to competitors&#8217; actions and market conditions, as well as general economic downturns;

&#8226; &#160; because many of them tend to be privately owned, there is generally little publicly available information about these businesses; therefore, although Oxford Square Management&#8217;s agents will perform &#8220;due diligence&#8221; investigations on these portfolio companies, their operations and their prospects, we may not learn all of the material information we need to know regarding these businesses;

&#8226; &#160; some of these companies are more likely to depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of persons; therefore, the death, disability, resignation or termination of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on our portfolio company and, in turn, on us;

&#8226; &#160; some of these companies may have less predictable operating results, may from time to time be parties to litigation, may be engaged in rapidly changing businesses with products subject to a substantial risk of obsolescence, and may require substantial additional capital to support their operations, finance expansion or maintain their competitive position; and

&#8226; &#160; many of these companies may be more susceptible to economic recessions or downturns than other better capitalized companies that operate in less capital -intensive industries.

A portfolio company&#8217;s failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by us or other lenders could lead to defaults and, potentially, termination of its loans and foreclosure on its assets, which could trigger cross -defaults under other agreements and jeopardize our portfolio company&#8217;s ability to meet its obligations under the debt securities that we hold. We may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms with a defaulting portfolio company. In addition, if a portfolio company goes bankrupt, even though we may have structured our interest as senior debt, depending on the facts and circumstances, including the extent to which we actually provided significant &#8220;managerial assistance&#8221; to that portfolio company, a bankruptcy court might recharacterize our debt holding and subordinate all or a portion of our claim to that of other creditors.

Inflation may adversely affect our and our portfolio companies&#8217; business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Inflation could negatively impact our business, including our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms, or could negatively impact our portfolio companies. Sustained inflation could increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. These events could limit 

our investment originations, limit our ability to grow and negatively impact our operating results. Further, inflation could make it difficult to extend the maturity of, or refinance existing indebtedness or obtain new indebtedness on favorable terms.

Certain of our portfolio companies may be impacted by inflation. If such portfolio companies are unable to pass any increases in their costs along to their customers, it could adversely affect their results and impact their ability to pay interest and principal on our loans. In addition, any projected future decreases in our portfolio companies&#8217; operating results due to inflation could adversely impact the fair value of those investments. Any decreases in the fair value of our investments could result in future unrealized losses and therefore reduce our net assets resulting from operations.

Our failure to make follow-on investments in our portfolio companies could impair the value of our investment portfolio. 

Following an initial investment in a portfolio company, we may make additional investments in that portfolio company as &#8220;follow -on &#8221; investments, in order to: (i) increase or maintain in whole or in part our equity ownership percentage; (ii) exercise warrants, options or convertible securities that were acquired in the original or subsequent financing; or (iii) attempt to preserve or enhance the value of our investment.

We may elect not to make follow -on investments or otherwise lack sufficient funds to make those investments. We have the discretion to make any follow -on investments, subject to the availability of capital resources. The failure to make follow -on investments may, in some circumstances, jeopardize the continued viability of a portfolio company and our initial investment, or may result in a missed opportunity for us to increase our participation in a successful operation. Even if we have sufficient capital to make a desired follow -on investment, we may elect not to make a follow -on investment because we may not want to increase our concentration of risk, because we prefer other opportunities, or because we are inhibited by compliance with BDC requirements or the desire to maintain our tax status.

Our incentive fee may induce Oxford Square Management to use leverage and to make speculative investments. 

The incentive fee payable by us to Oxford Square Management may create an incentive for Oxford Square Management to use leverage and to make investments on our behalf that are risky or more speculative than would be the case in the absence of such compensation arrangement. The way in which the incentive fee on &#8220;Pre -Incentive Fee Net Investment Income&#8221; is determined, which is calculated as a percentage of the return on invested capital, may encourage Oxford Square Management to use leverage to increase the return on our equity capital. Under certain circumstances, the use of leverage may increase the likelihood of default, which would disfavor holders of our common stock. Similarly, because Oxford Square Management may also receive an incentive fee based, in part, upon the capital gains realized on our investments, the investment adviser may invest more than would otherwise be appropriate in companies whose securities are likely to yield capital gains, compared to income producing securities. Such a practice could result in our investing in more speculative securities than would otherwise be the case, which could result in higher investment losses, particularly during an economic downturn.

Our portfolio companies may incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, our investments in such companies. 

We intend to invest primarily in senior debt securities, but may also invest in subordinated debt securities, issued by our portfolio companies. In some cases, portfolio companies will be permitted to have other debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, the debt securities in which we invest. By their terms, such debt instruments may provide that the holders thereof are entitled to receive payment of interest or principal on or before the dates on which we are entitled to receive payments in respect of the debt securities in which we invest. Also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a portfolio company, holders of debt instruments ranking senior to our investment in that portfolio company would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any distribution in respect of our investment. After repaying such senior creditors, such portfolio company may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying its obligations to us. In the case of debt ranking equally with debt securities in which we invest, we would have to share on an equal basis any distributions with other creditors holding such debt in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of the relevant portfolio company. 

In addition, we will not be in a position to control any portfolio company by investing in its debt securities. As a result, we are subject to the risk that a portfolio company in which we invest may make business decisions with which we disagree and the management of such companies, as representatives of the holders of their common equity, may take risks or otherwise act in ways that do not best serve our interests as debt investors.

We may not realize gains from our equity investments. 

When we invest in debt securities, we may acquire warrants or other equity securities as well. However, the equity interests we receive may not appreciate in value and, in fact, may decline in value. Accordingly, we may not be able to realize gains from our equity interests, and any gains that we do realize on the disposition of any equity interests may not be sufficient to offset any other losses we experience.

Because we generally do not hold controlling equity interests in our portfolio companies, we may not be in a position to exercise control over our portfolio companies or to prevent decisions by the managements of our portfolio companies that could decrease the value of our investments. 

Although we have taken and may in the future take controlling equity positions in our portfolio companies from time to time, we generally do not do so. As a result, we are subject to the risk that a portfolio company may make business decisions with which we disagree, and the stockholders and management of a portfolio company may take risks or otherwise act in ways that are adverse to our interests. Due to the lack of liquidity for the debt and equity investments that we typically hold in our portfolio companies, we may not be able to dispose of our investments in the event we disagree with the actions of a portfolio company, and may therefore suffer a decrease in the value of our investments.

Our investments in CLO vehicles are riskier and less transparent to us and our stockholders than direct investments in the underlying senior loans. 

We have invested in equity and junior debt tranches issued by CLO vehicles. Generally, there may be less information available to us regarding the underlying debt investments held by such CLO vehicles than if we had invested directly in the debt of the underlying companies. As a result, our stockholders may not know the details of the underlying securities of the CLO vehicles in which we will invest. Our CLO investments will also be subject to the risk of leverage associated with the debt issued by such CLOs and the repayment priority of senior debt holders in such CLO vehicles. Additionally, CLOs in which we invest are often governed by a complex series of legal documents and contracts. As a result, the risk of dispute over interpretation or enforceability of the documentation may be higher relative to other types of investments. For example, some documents governing the loans underlying our CLO investments may allow for &#8220;priming transactions,&#8221; in connection with which majority lenders or debtors can amend loan documents to the detriment of other lenders, amend loan documents in order to move collateral, or amend documents in order to facilitate capital outflow to other parties/subsidiaries in a capital structure, any of which may adversely affect the rights and security priority of the CLOs in which we are invested.

The accounting and tax implications of such investments are complicated. In particular, reported earnings from the equity tranche investments of these CLO vehicles are recorded under GAAP based upon an effective yield calculation. Current taxable earnings on these investments, however, will generally not be determinable until after the end of the fiscal year of each individual CLO vehicle that ends within the Company&#8217;s fiscal year, even though the investments are generating cash flow. In general, the tax treatment of these investments may result in higher distributable earnings in the early years and a capital loss at maturity, while for reporting purposes the totality of cash flows are reflected in a constant yield to maturity.

Some instruments issued by CLO vehicles may not be readily marketable and may be subject to restrictions on resale. Securities issued by CLO vehicles are generally not listed on any U.S. national securities exchange and no active trading market may exist for the securities of CLO vehicles in which we may invest. Although a secondary market may exist for our investments in CLO vehicles, the market for our investments in CLO vehicles may be subject to irregular trading activity, wide bid/ask spreads and extended trade settlement periods. As a result, these types of investments may be more difficult to value.

Failure by a CLO vehicle in which we are invested to satisfy certain tests will harm our operating results. 

The failure by a CLO vehicle in which we invest to satisfy certain financial covenants, specifically those with respect to adequate collateralization and/or interest coverage tests, could lead to a reduction in its payments to us. In the event that a CLO vehicle failed these certain tests, holders of debt senior to us may be entitled to additional 

payments that would, in turn, reduce the payments we would otherwise be entitled to receive. Separately, we may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms, which may include the waiver of certain financial covenants, with a defaulting CLO vehicle or any other investment we may make. If any of these occur, it could materially and adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.

Our financial results may be affected adversely if one or more of our significant equity or junior debt investments in a CLO vehicle defaults on its payment obligations or fails to perform as we expect or if the market price fluctuates significantly in such illiquid investments. 

As a BDC, we may not acquire equity and junior debt investments in CLO vehicles unless, at the time of such acquisition, at least 70% of our total assets are &#8220;qualifying assets.&#8221; CLO vehicles that we invest in are typically very highly levered, and therefore, the junior debt and equity tranches that we invest in are subject to a higher degree of risk of total loss. As of December 31, 2024, the CLO vehicles in which we were invested had average leverage of 6.49 times and ranged from approximately 0.41 times to 9.69 times levered. In particular, investors in CLO vehicles indirectly bear risks of the underlying debt investments held by such CLO vehicles. We will generally have the right to receive payments only from the CLO vehicles, and will generally not have direct rights against the underlying borrowers or the entity that sponsored the CLO vehicle. While the CLO vehicles we have and continue to target generally enable the investor to acquire interests in a pool of leveraged corporate loans without the expenses associated with directly holding the same investments, we will generally indirectly pay a proportionate share of the CLO vehicles&#8217; administrative and other expenses. Although it is difficult to predict whether the prices of indices and securities underlying CLO vehicles will rise or fall, these prices (and, therefore, the prices of the CLO vehicles) will be influenced by the same types of political and economic events that affect issuers of securities and capital markets generally. The failure by a CLO vehicle in which we invest to satisfy certain financial covenants, including as a result of political and economic events not directly associated with the leveraged corporate loans held by the CLO, and specifically those with respect to adequate collateralization and/or interest coverage tests, could lead to a reduction in its payments to us. In the event that a CLO vehicle failed those tests, holders of debt senior to us may be entitled to additional payments that would, in turn, reduce the payments we would otherwise be entitled to receive. Separately, we may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms with a defaulting CLO vehicle or any other investment we may make. If any of these occur, it could materially and adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.

The interests we intend to acquire in CLO vehicles will likely be thinly traded or have only a limited trading market. CLO vehicles are typically privately offered and sold, even in the secondary market. As a result, investments in CLO vehicles may be characterized as illiquid securities. In addition to the general risks associated with investing in debt securities, CLO vehicles carry additional risks, including, but not limited to: (i) the possibility that distributions from collateral securities will not be adequate to make interest or other payments; (ii) the quality of the collateral may decline in value or default; (iii) the fact that our investments in CLO tranches will likely be subordinate to other senior classes of note tranches thereof; and (iv) the complex structure of the security may not be fully understood at the time of investment and may produce disputes with the CLO vehicle or unexpected investment results. Our net asset value may also decline over time if our principal recovery with respect to CLO equity investments is less than the price we paid for those investments.

Investments in structured vehicles, including equity and junior debt instruments issued by CLO vehicles, involve risks, including credit risk and market risk. Changes in interest rates and credit quality may cause significant price fluctuations. Additionally, changes in the underlying leveraged corporate loans held by a CLO vehicle may cause payments on the instruments we hold to be reduced, either temporarily or permanently.

Structured investments, particularly the subordinated interests in which we intend to invest, are less liquid than many other types of securities and may be more volatile than the leveraged corporate loans underlying the CLO vehicles we intend to target. Fluctuations in interest rates may also cause payments on the tranches of CLO vehicles that we hold to be reduced, either temporarily or permanently.

Investments in foreign securities formed under the laws of the Cayman Islands may involve significant risks in addition to the risks inherent in U.S. investments. 

Our investment strategy involves investments in securities issued by foreign entities, including foreign CLO vehicles that are formed under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Investing in foreign entities formed under the laws of the Cayman Islands may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. issues. These 

risks include changes in exchange control regulations, political and social instability, expropriation, imposition of foreign taxes, less liquid markets and less available information than is generally the case in the U.S., higher transaction costs, less government supervision of exchanges, brokers and issuers, less developed bankruptcy laws, difficulty in enforcing contractual obligations, lack of uniform accounting and auditing standards and greater price volatility. Further, we, and the CLO vehicles in which we invest, may have difficulty enforcing creditor&#8217;s rights in foreign jurisdictions, such as the Cayman Islands. In addition, the underlying companies of the CLO vehicles in which we invest may be foreign, which may create greater exposure for us to foreign economic developments.

Although we expect that most of our investments will be U.S. dollar -denominated , any investments denominated in a foreign currency will be subject to the risk that the value of a particular currency will change in relation to one or more other currencies. Among the factors that may affect currency values are trade balances, the level of short -term interest rates, differences in relative values of similar assets in different currencies, long -term opportunities for investment and capital appreciation, and political developments. We may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks, but we can offer no assurance that we will, in fact, hedge currency risk, or that if we do, such strategies will be effective.

We will have no influence on management of underlying investments managed by non-affiliated third party CLO collateral managers. 

We are not responsible for and have no influence over the asset management of the portfolios underlying the CLO investments we hold as those portfolios are managed by non -affiliated third party CLO collateral managers. Similarly, we are not responsible for and have no influence over the day -to-day management, administration or any other aspect of the issuers of the individual securities. As a result, the values of the portfolios underlying our CLO investments could decrease as a result of decisions made by third party CLO collateral managers.

RISKS RELATING TO AN INVESTMENT IN OUR SECURITIES 

Our common stock price may be volatile. 

The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially depending on many factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be directly related to our operating performance. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:

&#8226; &#160; price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;

&#8226; &#160; significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of regulated investment companies, BDCs or other financial services companies;

&#8226; &#160; exclusion of our common stock from certain indices could reduce the ability of certain investment funds to own our common stock and put short -term selling pressure on our common stock;

&#8226; &#160; changes in regulatory policies or tax guidelines with respect to regulated investment companies or BDCs;

&#8226; &#160; actual or anticipated changes in our earnings or fluctuations in our operating results or changes in the expectations of securities analysts;

&#8226; &#160; general economic conditions and trends;

&#8226; &#160; loss of a major funding source; or

&#8226; &#160; departures of key personnel.

In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company&#8217;s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against such company. Due to the potential volatility of our stock price, we may therefore be the target of securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management&#8217;s attention and resources from our business. Refer to &#8220;Risks relating to our business and structure &#8212; Our business and operation could be negatively affected if we become subject to any additional securities litigation or stockholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of our investment strategy and impact our stock price.&#8221;

Our shares of common stock have traded at a discount from net asset value and may do so in the future. 

Shares of BDCs have frequently traded at a market price that is less than the net asset value that is attributable to those shares. Our common stock has traded below our net asset value and could trade at a discount to net asset value at any time in the future. The possibility that our shares of common stock may trade at a discount from net asset value over the long term is separate and distinct from the risk that our net asset value will decrease.

If our common stock trades below its net asset value, we will generally not be able to issue additional shares of our common stock at its market price without first obtaining the approval for such issuance from our stockholders and our independent directors. If additional funds are not available to us, we could be forced to curtail or cease our new lending and investment activities, and our net asset value could decrease and our level of distributions could be impacted. Our net asset value may also decline over time if our principal recovery with respect to CLO equity investments is less than the price that we paid for those investments.

There is a risk that investors in our equity securities will not receive distributions or that our distributions will not grow over time and a portion of our distributions could be a return of capital. 

We intend to make distributions to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution. We cannot assure you that we will achieve investment results that will allow us to make a specified level of cash distributions or year -to-year increases in cash distributions. Our ability to pay distributions could be adversely affected by the impact of one or more of the risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10 -K as well as any amendments reflected in subsequent filings with the SEC. In addition, all distributions are and will be paid at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, maintenance of our RIC status, compliance with applicable BDC regulations and such other factors as our Board of Directors could deem relevant from time to time. If we declare a distribution and if more stockholders opt to receive cash distributions rather than participate in our dividend reinvestment plan, we could be forced to sell some of our investments in order to make cash distribution payments. To the extent we make distributions to stockholders that include a return of capital, such portion of the distribution essentially constitutes a return of the stockholder&#8217;s investment. Although such return of capital is generally not currently taxable, such distributions would generally decrease a stockholder&#8217;s basis in our common stock and could therefore increase such stockholder&#8217;s tax liability for capital gains upon the future sale or other disposition of such common stock. A return of capital distribution could cause a stockholder to recognize a capital gain from the sale of our common stock even if the stockholder sells its shares for less than the original purchase price.

Your interest in us may be diluted if you do not fully exercise your subscription rights in any rights offering. 

In the event we issue subscription rights or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, stockholders who do not fully exercise their rights or warrants should expect that they will, at the completion of the offer, own a smaller proportional interest in us than would otherwise be the case if they fully exercised their rights or warrants. We cannot state precisely the amount of any such dilution in share ownership because we do not know at this time what proportion of the shares will be purchased as a result of the offer.

In addition, if the subscription price is less than our net asset value per share, then our stockholders would experience an immediate dilution of the aggregate net asset value of their shares as a result of the offer. The amount of any decrease in net asset value is not predictable because it is not known at this time what the subscription price, warrant exercise price or net asset value per share will be on the expiration date of such rights offering or what proportion of the shares will be purchased as a result of the offer. Such dilution could be substantial.

If we issue preferred stock, the net asset value and market value of our common stock will likely become more volatile. 

We cannot assure you that the issuance of preferred stock would result in a higher yield or return to the holders of the common stock. The issuance of preferred stock would likely cause the net asset value and market value of the common stock to become more volatile. If the distribution rate on the preferred stock were to approach the net rate of return on our investment portfolio, the benefit of leverage to the holders of the common stock would be reduced. If the distribution rate on the preferred stock were to exceed the net rate of return on our portfolio, the leverage would result in a lower rate of return to the holders of common stock than if we had not issued preferred stock. Any decline in the net asset value of our investments would be borne entirely by the holders of common 

stock. Therefore, if the market value of our portfolio were to decline, the leverage would result in a greater decrease in net asset value to the holders of common stock than if we were not leveraged through the issuance of preferred stock. This greater net asset value decrease would also tend to cause a greater decline in the market price for the common stock. We might be in danger of failing to maintain the required asset coverage of the preferred stock or of losing our ratings, if any, on the preferred stock or, in an extreme case, our current investment income might not be sufficient to meet the distribution requirements on the preferred stock. In order to counteract such an event, we might need to liquidate investments in order to fund a redemption of some or all of the preferred stock. In addition, we would pay (and the holders of common stock would bear) all costs and expenses relating to the issuance and ongoing maintenance of the preferred stock, including a likely higher advisory fee. Holders of preferred stock may have different interests than holders of common stock and may at times have disproportionate influence over our affairs.

Holders of any preferred stock we might issue would have the right to elect members of our Board of Directors and class voting rights on certain matters. 

Holders of any preferred stock we might issue, voting separately as a single class, would have the right to elect two members of our Board of Directors at all times and in the event distributions become two full years in arrears would have the right to elect a majority of the directors until such arrearage is completely eliminated. In addition, preferred stockholders have class voting rights on certain matters, including changes in fundamental investment restrictions and conversion to open -end status, and accordingly can veto any such changes. Restrictions imposed on the declarations and payment of distributions or other distributions to the holders of our common stock and preferred stock, both by the 1940 Act and by requirements imposed by rating agencies, if any, or the terms of our credit facilities, if any, might impair our ability to maintain our tax treatment as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. While we would intend to redeem our preferred stock to the extent necessary to enable us to distribute our income as required to maintain our qualification as a RIC, there can be no assurance that such actions could be effected in time to meet the tax requirements.

The net asset value per share of our common stock may be diluted if we sell shares of our common stock in one or more offerings at prices below the then current net asset value per share of our common stock. 

If we were to sell shares of our common stock below its then current net asset value per share, such sales would result in an immediate dilution to the net asset value per share of our common stock. This dilution would occur as a result of the sale of shares at a price below the then current net asset value per share of our common stock and a proportionately greater decrease in the stockholders&#8217; interest in our earnings and assets and their voting interest in us than the increase in our assets resulting from such issuance. Because the number of shares of common stock that could be so issued and the timing of any issuance is not currently known, the actual dilutive effect cannot be predicted.

Further, if our current stockholders do not purchase any shares to maintain their percentage interest, regardless of whether such offering is above or below the then current net asset value per share, their voting power will be diluted. For example, if we sell an additional 10% of our common shares at a 10% discount from net asset value, a stockholder who does not participate in that offering for its proportionate interest will suffer net asset value dilution of up to 1.0% or $10 per $1,000 of net asset value.

GENERAL RISKS 

We are operating in a period of capital markets volatility and economic uncertainty. The conditions have materially and adversely affected debt and equity capital markets in the United States, and any future volatility or instability in capital markets may have a negative impact on our business and operations. 

From time to time, capital markets may experience periods of volatility and instability for a variety of reasons. In addition to the factors described above, other factors described herein that may affect market, economic and geopolitical conditions, and thereby adversely affect the Company including, without limitation, economic slowdown in the United States and internationally, changes in interest rates and/or a lack of availability of credit in the United States and internationally, commodity price volatility and changes in law and/or regulation, and uncertainty regarding government and regulatory policy. The full impact of any such risks is uncertain and difficult to predict.

Capital markets volatility and instability have also occurred in the past and may occur in the future. For example, from 2008 to 2009, the global capital markets were unstable as evidenced by the lack of liquidity in the debt capital markets, significant write -offs in the financial services sector, the re -pricing of credit risk in the broadly syndicated credit market and the failure of major financial institutions. Despite actions of the U.S. federal government and various foreign governments, these events contributed to worsening general economic conditions that materially and adversely impacted the broader financial and credit markets and reduced the availability of debt and equity capital for the market as a whole and financial services firms in particular. There have been more recent periods of volatility and there can be no assurance that adverse market conditions will not repeat themselves in the future. Furthermore, uncertainty between the United States and other countries with respect to trade policies, treaties and tariffs, among other factors, have caused volatility in the global markets, and we cannot assure you that these market conditions will not continue or worsen in the future. Terrorist acts, acts of war, natural disasters, or disease outbreaks, pandemics or other public health crises may cause periods of market instability and volatility and may disrupt the operations of us and our portfolio companies for extended periods of time. If similar adverse and volatile market conditions repeat in the future, we and other companies in the financial services sector may have to access, if available, alternative markets for debt and equity capital in order to grow. Equity capital may be particularly difficult to raise during periods of adverse or volatile market conditions because, subject to some limited exceptions, as a BDC, we are generally not able to issue additional shares of our common stock at a price less than the net asset value per share without first obtaining approval for such issuance from our stockholders and our Board of Directors, including all of our directors who are not &#8220;interested persons&#8221; of the Company, as defined in the 1940 Act.

Moreover, the re -appearance of market conditions similar to those experienced from 2008 through 2009 for any substantial length of time or worsened market conditions, including as a result of U.S. government shutdowns or the perceived creditworthiness of the United States, could make it difficult for us to borrow money or to extend the maturity of or refinance any indebtedness we may have under similar terms and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business. The debt capital that will be available to us in the future, if any, may be at a higher cost and on less favorable terms and conditions than would currently be available. If we are unable to raise or refinance debt, stockholders may not benefit from the potential for increased returns on equity resulting from leverage and we may be limited in our ability to make new commitments or to fund existing commitments to our portfolio companies.

Given the periods of extreme volatility and dislocation in the capital markets from time to time, many BDCs have faced, and may in the future face, a challenging environment in which to raise or access capital. In addition, significant changes in the capital markets, including the extreme volatility and disruption over the past several years, has had, and may in the future have, a negative effect on asset valuations and on the potential for liquidity events. While most of our investments will not be publicly traded, applicable accounting standards require us to assume as part of our valuation process that our investments are sold in a principal market to market participants (even if we plan on holding an investment through to maturity). As a result, volatility in the capital markets can adversely affect the valuations of our investments. Further, the illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments to access capital if required. As a result, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded our investments if we were required to sell them for liquidity purposes. In addition, a prolonged period of market illiquidity may cause us to reduce the volume of loans and debt securities we originate and/or fund and adversely affect the value of our portfolio investments, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. An inability to raise or access capital could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Political, social and economic uncertainty creates and exacerbates risks. 

Social, political, economic and other conditions and events (such as natural disasters, epidemics and pandemics, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) will occur that create uncertainty and have significant impacts on issuers, industries, governments and other systems, including the financial markets, to which companies and their investments are exposed. As global systems, economies and financial markets are increasingly interconnected, events that once had only local impact are now more likely to have regional or even global effects. Events that occur in one country, region or financial market will, more frequently, adversely impact issuers in other countries, regions or markets, including in established markets such as the United States. These impacts can be exacerbated by failures of governments and societies to adequately respond to an emerging event or threat.

Uncertainty can result in or coincide with, among other things: increased volatility in the financial markets for securities, derivatives, loans, credit and currency; a decrease in the reliability of market prices and difficulty in valuing assets (including portfolio company assets); greater fluctuations in spreads on debt investments and currency exchange rates; increased risk of default (by both government and private obligors and issuers); further social, economic, and political instability; nationalization of private enterprise; greater governmental involvement in the economy or in social factors that impact the economy; changes to governmental regulation and supervision of the loan, securities, derivatives and currency markets and market participants and decreased or revised monitoring of such markets by governments or self -regulatory organizations and reduced enforcement of regulations; limitations on the activities of investors in such markets; controls or restrictions on foreign investment, capital controls and limitations on repatriation of invested capital; the significant loss of liquidity and the inability to purchase, sell and otherwise fund investments or settle transactions (including, but not limited to, a market freeze); unavailability of currency hedging techniques; substantial, and in some periods extremely high rates of inflation, which can last many years and have substantial negative effects on credit and securities markets as well as the economy as a whole; recessions; and difficulties in obtaining and/or enforcing legal judgments.

Global economic, regulatory and market conditions may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue growth and profitability. 

From time to time, social and political tensions in the United States and around the world, may contribute to increased market volatility, may have long -term effects on the U.S. and worldwide financial markets, and may cause economic uncertainties or deterioration in the United States and worldwide. For example, U.S. and global capital markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption during the economic downturn that began in mid -2007 , and the U.S. economy was in a recession for several consecutive calendar quarters during the same period.

Market and economic disruptions have affected, and may in the future affect, consumer confidence levels and spending, personal bankruptcy rates, levels of incurrence and default on consumer debt and home prices, among other factors. Uncertainty between the United States and other countries with respect to trade policies, treaties and tariffs, among other factors, have caused disruptions in the global markets, including markets in which we participate. We cannot assure you that these market conditions will not continue or worsen in the future. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that market disruptions in Europe, including the increased cost of funding for certain governments and financial institutions, will not impact the global economy, and we cannot assure you that assistance packages will be available, or if available, be sufficient to stabilize countries and markets in Europe or elsewhere affected by a financial crisis. To the extent uncertainty regarding any economic recovery in Europe negatively impacts consumer confidence and consumer credit factors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected.

Increased geopolitical unrest, terrorist attacks, or acts of war may affect any market for our common stock, impact the businesses in which we invest, and harm our business, operating results, and financial conditions. 

Terrorist activity and the continued threat of terrorism and acts of civil or international hostility, both within the United States and abroad, as well as ongoing military and other actions and heightened security measures in response to these types of threats, may cause significant volatility and declines in the global markets, loss of life, property damage, disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity, which may negatively impact the businesses in which we invest directly or indirectly and, in turn, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Losses from terrorist attacks are generally uninsurable.

The Israel -Hamas war and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East, and resulting market volatility, could also adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, operating results, and financial condition. The extent and duration or escalation of such conflicts, resulting sanctions and resulting future market disruptions are impossible to predict, but could be significant. Any disruptions resulting from such conflicts and any future conflict (including cyberattacks, espionage or the use or threatened use of nuclear weapons) or resulting from actual or threatened responses to such actions could cause disruptions to any of our portfolio companies located in Europe or the Middle East or that have substantial business relationships with companies in affected regions. It is not possible to predict the duration or extent of longer -term consequences of these conflicts, which could include further sanctions, retaliatory and escalating measures, embargoes, regional instability, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on or involving macroeconomic conditions, the energy sector, supply chains, inflation, security conditions, currency 

exchange rates and financial markets around the globe. Any such market disruptions could affect our portfolio companies&#8217; operations and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Changes in laws or regulations governing our operations may adversely affect our business or cause us to alter our business strategy. 

We and our portfolio companies are subject to regulation by laws at the local, state, and federal levels. These laws and regulations, as well as their interpretation, could change from time to time, including as the result of interpretive guidance or other directives from the U.S. President and others in the executive branch, and new laws, regulations and interpretations could also come into effect. Any such new or changed laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, and political uncertainty could increase regulatory uncertainty in the near term.

Changes to the laws and regulations governing our permitted investments may require a change to our investment strategy. Such changes could differ materially from our strategies and plans as set forth in this report and may shift our investment focus from the areas of expertise of Oxford Square Management. Thus, any such changes, if they occur, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment in us.

Legislative changes, any other significant changes in economic or tax policy and/or government programs, as well as any future such changes could have a material adverse impact on us and on our investments.

The effect of global climate change may impact the operations of our portfolio companies. 

There may be evidence of global climate change. Climate change creates physical and financial risk and some of our portfolio companies may be adversely affected by climate change. For example, the needs of customers of energy companies vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity. To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of any changes. Increases in the cost of energy could adversely affect the cost of operations of our portfolio companies if the use of energy products or services is material to their business. A decrease in energy use due to weather changes may affect some of our portfolio companies&#8217; financial condition, through decreased revenues. Extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stresses, including service interruptions. Energy companies could also be affected by the potential for lawsuits against or taxes or other regulatory costs imposed on greenhouse gas emitters, based on links drawn between greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.

Changes to United States tariff and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on our portfolio companies and, in turn, harm us. 

There has been ongoing discussion and commentary regarding potential significant changes to United States trade policies, treaties and tariffs. There is significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and other countries with respect to the trade policies, treaties and tariffs. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between the impacted nations and the United States. Any of these factors could depress economic activity and restrict our portfolio companies&#8217; access to suppliers or customers and have a material adverse effect on their business, financial condition and results of operations, which in turn would negatively impact us.

Internal and external cyber threats, as well as other disasters, could impair our ability to conduct business effectively. 

The occurrence of a disaster such as a cyber -attack against us or against a third -party that has access to our data or networks, a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, a terrorist attack or war, disease pandemics, events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems, or a support failure from external providers, could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial condition, particularly if those events affect our computer -based data processing, transmission, storage, and retrieval systems or destroy data.

We depend heavily upon computer systems to perform necessary business functions. Despite our implementation of a variety of security measures, our computers, networks, and data, like those of other companies, could be subject to cyber -attacks and unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, such as from physical and electronic break -ins or unauthorized tampering. If one or more of these events occurs, it could potentially jeopardize the confidential, proprietary and other information processed, stored in, and transmitted through our computer systems and networks. Such an attack could cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations, which could result in financial losses, litigation, regulatory penalties, client dissatisfaction or loss, reputational damage, and increased costs associated with mitigation of damages and remediation.

Third parties with which we do business may also be sources of cybersecurity or other technological risk. We outsource certain functions and these relationships allow for the storage and processing of our information, as well as client, counterparty, employee, and borrower information. While we engage in actions to reduce our exposure resulting from outsourcing, ongoing threats may result in unauthorized access, loss, exposure, destruction, or other cybersecurity incident that affects our data, resulting in increased costs and other consequences as described above.

Certain of our service providers may be impacted by hybrid work policies adopted by companies following the COVID -19 pandemic, which are obstructing the regular functioning of business workforces (including requiring employees to work from external locations and their homes).

We are highly dependent on information systems and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business, which may, in turn, negatively affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to pay distributions. 

Our business is highly dependent on our and third parties&#8217; communications and information systems. Any failure or interruption of those systems, including as a result of the termination of an agreement with any third -party service providers, could cause delays or other problems in our activities. Our financial, accounting, data processing, backup or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control and adversely affect our business. There could be:

&#8226; &#160; sudden electrical or telecommunications outages;

&#8226; &#160; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes;

&#8226; &#160; events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and

&#8226; &#160; cyber -attacks 

These events, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and negatively affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders.

Cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents may adversely affect our business or the businesses of our portfolio companies by causing disruptions to our operations or to the operations of our portfolio companies, a compromising or corruption of our confidential information or the confidential information of our portfolio companies and/or damage to our business relationships or the business relationships of our portfolio companies, all of which could negatively impact the business, financial condition and operating results of us or our portfolio companies. 

A cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the information resources of us, Oxford Square Management or our portfolio companies. These incidents may be an intentional attack or an unintentional event and could involve gaining unauthorized access to our or Oxford Square Management&#8217;s information systems or those of our portfolio companies for purposes of misappropriating assets, stealing confidential information, corrupting data or causing operational disruption. Oxford Square Management&#8217;s employees may be the target of fraudulent calls, emails and other forms of activities. The result of these incidents may include disrupted operations, misstated or unreliable financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection and insurance costs, litigation and damage to business relationships. Our business operations rely upon secure information technology systems for data processing, storage, 

and reporting. We depend on the effectiveness of the information and cybersecurity policies, procedures, and capabilities maintained by our affiliates and our and their respective third -party service providers to protect their computer and telecommunications systems and the data that reside on or are transmitted through them.

Substantial costs may be incurred in order to prevent any cyber incidents in the future. The costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. As our and our portfolio companies&#8217; reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our information systems, both internal and those provided by Oxford Square Management and third -party service providers, and the information systems of our portfolio companies. Oxford Square Management has implemented processes, procedures and internal controls to help mitigate cybersecurity risks and cyber intrusions, but these measures, as well as our increased awareness of the nature and extent of a risk of a cyber incident, do not guarantee that a cyber incident will not occur and/or that our financial results, operations or confidential information will not be negatively impacted by such an incident. In addition, cybersecurity continues to be a key priority for regulators around the world, and some jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals or the general investing public of data security breaches involving certain types of personal data, including the SEC, which, on July 26, 2023, adopted amendments requiring the prompt public disclosure of certain cybersecurity breaches. If we fail to comply with the relevant laws and regulations, we could suffer financial losses, a disruption of our business, liability to investors, regulatory intervention or reputational damage.

We are subject to risks associated with artificial intelligence and machine learning technology 

Artificial intelligence, including machine learning and similar tools and technologies that collect, aggregate, analyze or generate data or other materials, or collectively, AI, and its current and potential future applications including in the private investment and financial industries, as well as the legal and regulatory frameworks within which AI operates, continue to rapidly evolve.

Recent technological advances in AI pose risks to the Company, the Adviser, and our portfolio investments. The Company and our portfolio investments could also be exposed to the risks of AI if third -party service providers or any counterparties, whether or not known to the Company, also use AI in their business activities. We and our portfolio companies may not be in a position to control the use of AI technology in third -party products or services.

Use of AI could include the input of confidential information in contravention of applicable policies, contractual or other obligations or restrictions, resulting in such confidential information becoming part accessible by other third -party AI applications and users. While the Adviser does not currently use AI to make investment recommendations, the use of AI could also exacerbate or create new and unpredictable risks to our business, the Adviser&#8217;s business, and the business of our portfolio companies, including by potentially significantly disrupting the markets in which we and our portfolio companies operate or subjecting us, our portfolio companies and the Adviser to increased competition and regulation, which could materially and adversely affect business, financial condition or results of operations of us, our portfolio companies and the Adviser. In addition, the use of AI by bad actors could heighten the sophistication and effectiveness of cyber and security attacks experienced by our portfolio companies and the Adviser.

Independent of its context of use, AI technology is generally highly reliant on the collection and analysis of large amounts of data, and it is not possible or practicable to incorporate all relevant data into the model that AI technology utilizes to operate. Certain data in such models will inevitably contain a degree of inaccuracy and error &#8212; potentially materially so &#8212; and could otherwise be inadequate or flawed, which would be likely to degrade the effectiveness of AI technology. To the extent that we or our portfolio investments are exposed to the risks of AI use, any such inaccuracies or errors could have adverse impacts on the Company or our investments.

AI technology and its applications, including in the private investment and financial sectors, continue to develop rapidly, and it is impossible to predict the future risks that may arise from such developments.

We are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility. 

Our business faces increasing public scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) activities. We risk damage to our brand and reputation if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas, such as environmental stewardship, corporate governance and transparency and considering ESG factors in our investment 

processes. Adverse incidents with respect to ESG activities could impact the value of our brand, the cost of our operations and relationships with investors, all of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, new regulatory initiatives related to ESG could adversely affect our business.

We maintain our cash at financial institutions, often in balances that exceed federally insured limits. 

Our cash is held in accounts at a U.S. banking institution that we believe is of high quality. Cash held in non -interest-bearing and interest -bearing operating accounts may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) insurance limits. If such banking institutions were to fail, we could lose all or a portion of those amounts held in excess of such insurance limitations. While the FDIC took control of two such banking institutions, Silicon Valley Bank (&#8220;SVB&#8221;), on March 10, 2023 and Signature Bank (&#8220;Signature&#8221;) on March 12, 2023, we did not have any accounts with SVB or Signature and therefore did not experience any specific risk of loss. As the FDIC continues to address the situation with SVB, Signature Bank and other similarly situated banking institutions, the risk of loss in excess of insurance limitations has generally increased. Any material loss that we may experience in the future could have an adverse effect on our ability to pay our operational expenses or make other payments and may require us to move our accounts to other banks, which could cause a temporary delay in making payments to our vendors and employees and cause other operational inconveniences.

The following are certain risk factors that affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Many of these risks are beyond our control. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that we face. If any of the events described below were to actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected and our results could differ materially from expected and historical results, any of which may also adversely affect the holders of our stock. 

Risks Related to Our Operations and Industry 

&#8203; 

The volatility of oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect the demand for our systems, products and services, and negatively impact our results of operations. 

The demand for our products and services is primarily determined by current and anticipated oil and natural gas prices and the related levels of capital spending and drilling activity in the areas in which we have operations. Among other factors, increased production from major oil producing nations and decreasing availability of crude oil storage and geopolitical issues can contribute to volatility or weakness in oil prices or natural gas prices (or the perception that oil prices or natural gas prices will decrease or remain stagnant) and affect the spending patterns of our customers resulting in the drilling of fewer new wells. As a result, demand for proppants or chemicals may decrease, which could, in turn, lead to lower demand for our products and services and may cause lower prices and lower utilization of our assets. We have, and may in the future, experienced significant fluctuations in operating results as a result of the reactions of our customers to changes in oil and natural gas prices. 

We face a variety of risks related to our entry into a new line of business following the completion of the MER Acquisition. 

Our entry into scaled distributed power solutions is expected to enhance our position as a mobile equipment and logistics solution provider to the industries we service as well as diversify our business.

Entry into a new line of business may also subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk. Further, our management team has not directly engaged in the distributed power solutions business before, and our lack of experience may result in delays or further complications to 

our new business and increases our dependence upon former MER employees that have experience in the field. If we are unable to successfully implement the acquired business of MER, our revenue and profitability may not grow as we expect, our competitiveness may be materially and adversely affected, and our reputation and business may be harmed.

We face significant competition, as well as the prospect of further consolidation in the industry and amongst current and potential customers, either of which may impede our ability to gain market share or cause us to lose market share, or that could make adoption of new product offerings or services difficult. 

The market for supply chain management and well site logistic services is becoming increasingly competitive. We face competition from proppant producers, pressure pumping companies and proppant transporters who also offer solutions for unloading, storing and delivering proppant at well sites and also from competitors who, like us, are focused on developing more efficient last mile logistics management solutions. Some of these solutions utilize containers for on-site proppant storage and handling delivery, while others use silo-based storage as we do. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do and may develop technology superior to ours or more cost-effective than ours. Competition in our industry and for our products is thus based on price, consistency and quality of products, distribution capability, customer service, reliability, breadth of product offering and technical support. If our competitors are able to respond to industry conditions or trends more rapidly or effectively or resort to price competition, or if we are unable to gain market acceptance of new product offerings, we may be unable to gain or maintain our market share or may lose market share or operating profit, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Additionally, the market in which we operate is experiencing increased vertical and horizontal integration both amongst peers as well as customers and suppliers. Consolidation amongst current or potential customers could affect demand for our products and services if those customers utilize competing solutions and services or gain their own capabilities through the consolidation itself. It is not certain that we will be able to maintain the same relationships or ability to offer our products and services in the wake of consolidation, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 

Our Power Solutions segment is dependent on our relationships with key suppliers to obtain equipment. 

Our Power Solutions segment is dependent on a limited number of key suppliers for access to the unique equipment used in this segment. If we fail to maintain adequate relationships with such suppliers or if we fail to receive equipment from our suppliers in a timely manner, then our competitive position may be harmed and our operations, financial conditions and/or cash flows may be negatively impacted.

In addition, the prices of certain equipment used in our Power Solutions segment may continue to experience inflationary pressures and be subject to tariffs that could further increase such costs. We may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers or, if we do pass on these costs, our customers may seek out alternatives to us, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.

Unavailability of, and lengthy delays in obtaining, the necessary equipment may result from a number of factors affecting our suppliers, including capacity constraints, labor shortages or disputes, supplier product quality issues, the impact of tariffs and other federal trade policy and suppliers&#8217; allocations to other purchasers. These risks can be magnified in a weak economic environment or following increases in demand arising from an economic downturn, but are also generally present due to the nature of our business and our dependence on highly-specialized equipment, some of which is sourced internationally. Such disruptions could result in our inability to effectively meet the needs of our customers and could result in a material adverse effect on operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.

We may be unable to adapt our distributed power technologies to meet increasing customer needs and power loads, which could result in increased downtime of our power generation offering and disruptions to the power supply to our customers. 

Demand for power has continued to significantly outpace available power generation supply from the grid, with the electrification of the oil and natural gas industry, as an example, straining aging and unreliable power grids. Further, the expanding use of artificial intelligence has led to the expansion of existing data centers and plans for new data centers.

As we expand our distributed power offering, the possibility exists that our current offering may not be able to effectively manage related power loads, resulting in potential downtimes and disruptions for our customers. Such experiences could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results due to the damage to our reputation and the resulting dissatisfaction of customers.

We expect to face significant competition in the future as the mobile power industry evolves. 

The landscape of the mobile power industry is evolving rapidly, driven by increased demand from numerous end-markets, including those in the data center and energy businesses. As a result, increased competition from within the mobile power industry can likely be expected to occur. Should this materialize, the portion of the total addressable market that we could capture with our Power Solutions segment will be lower than expected which could translate to lower than expected revenues.

Many of our power systems involve long sales cycles. 

The sales cycle for our power systems, from initial contact with potential customers to the commencement of field delivery, may be lengthy. Customers generally consider a wide range of solutions before making a decision to rent or to purchase power systems. Before a customer commits to rent or purchase power systems, they often require a significant technical review, assessment of competitive offerings and approval at a number of management levels within their organization. During the time our customers are evaluating our offerings, we may incur substantial sales and marketing, engineering and research and development expenses, which we may ultimately be unable to offset with recognized profits.

Our customers may not continue to outsource their power system needs. 

Our customers can evaluate a wide range of applications and equipment to address standby and/or prime power generation needs. As a result of the significant resources and expertise required to develop these systems, certain of these customers have historically chosen to outsource the provision of power generation to us. To a significant extent, we depend on customers continuing to outsource their power generation needs. Customers may not continue to outsource as much or any of their power generation needs in the future or may seek alternative solutions.

Sustained levels of inflation and associated changes in monetary policy may result in increases to the cost of our goods, services and personnel, which in turn could cause our capital expenditures and operating costs to rise. 

Inflationary pressures have resulted in and may result in additional increases to the costs of our goods, services and personnel, which would in turn cause our capital expenditures and operating costs to rise. Due to the high levels of inflation in the U.S., the Federal Reserve and other central banks increased interest rates multiple times in 2022 and 2023, and although the Federal Reserve began to lower interest rates in 2024, uncertainty remains as to when or to the extent such elevated rates may be further decreased. To the extent rates remain high, this could have the effects of raising the cost of capital and depressing economic growth, either of which &#8211; or the combination thereof &#8211; could hurt the financial and operating results of our business. To the extent elevated inflation remains, we may experience further cost increases for our operations, including services, labor costs and equipment if our drilling activity increases. Furthermore, higher crude oil and natural gas prices may cause the costs of materials and services to continue to rise. We cannot predict any future trends in the rate of inflation, and a significant increase in inflation, to the extent we are unable to recover higher costs through higher crude oil and natural gas prices and revenues, would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Changes in U.S. trade policy, including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences, could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. 

There is currently significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and various other countries, including changes arising as a result of the U.S. presidential transition with respect to trade policies, treaties, tariffs, taxes, and other limitations on cross-border operations. Changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results, the extent of which cannot be predicted with certainty at this time.

Changes in the transportation industry, including the availability or reliability of transportation to supply our products and services, fluctuations in transportation costs, or changes in the way in which proppant or chemicals are transported to the well site, could impair the ability of our customers to take delivery of proppant or chemicals or make our products and services less attractive and thereby adversely impact our business. 

The transportation industry is subject to possible legislative and regulatory changes that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services, whether due in part to insufficient availability of workers to provide adequate levels of staffing, insufficient replacement vehicles, parts or other commodities from our third-party vendors in the supply chain, or otherwise. Disruption of transportation services due to factors outside of our control, including shortages of rail cars or trucks, insufficient available workforce or supply chain-provided commodities, increased costs associated with transportation services, extreme weather-related events, accidents, strikes, lockouts, increased regulation, more stringent railcar or safety regulatory initiatives, or other events could temporarily impair the ability of our customers to take delivery of our systems and proppant or chemicals at the well site or affect the provision of last mile services. Accordingly, if there are disruptions of the products or services utilized by our customers (whether these products or services are provided by us or a third party vendor), and they are unable to find alternative transportation providers, our business could be adversely affected. Additionally, alternative transportation methods for transporting and delivering proppant or chemicals to the well site could make our product offerings and services less attractive than those of our competitors and affect our results of operations.

Our business is subject to inherent risks some of which are beyond our control such as disasters and extreme or seasonal weather events. These risks may be self-insured or may not be fully covered under our insurance policies. 

Our assets and operations may be affected by natural or man-made disasters and other external events such as extreme weather events associated with tornados, extended periods of drought, wildfires, or otherwise that may disrupt our business, including manufacturing and field operations. Further, because our operations are located in different regions of the United States, there exists variability in seasonal weather events, which may include periods of excessive heat or heavy snow, ice, or rain, which may be exacerbated by the effects of climate change. These hazards can also cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, and suspension or cancellation of operations by us or our customers, thereby reducing the demand for our systems and services and our ability to generate revenues. In addition, our operations are subject to, and exposed to, employee/employer liabilities and risks such as wrongful termination, discrimination, labor organizing, retaliation claims and general human resource related matters.

We do not have insurance against all foreseeable risks and we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable. The occurrence of a significant event or adverse claim in excess of the insurance coverage that we maintain or that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. 

Reliance upon a few large customers may adversely affect our revenue and operating results. 

We derive, and may continue to derive, a significant portion of our revenue from a relatively small number of customers and the operations of our customers have and may continue to experience delays or disruptions and temporary suspensions of operations. For example, our Power Solutions segment is presently significantly dependent upon a single data center client. W e typically do not enter into long-term contractual agreements with our customers and if we were to lose any material customer, we may not be able to redeploy our equipment at similar utilization or pricing levels or within a short period of time and such loss could have a material adverse effect on our business until the equipment is redeployed at similar utilization or pricing levels.

&#8203; 

Events outside of our control, including a pandemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, political unrest, armed conflicts and economic recessions occurring around the globe, could materially adversely affect our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. 

We face risks that are outside of our control which could significantly disrupt the demand for oil and natural gas, power generation and our products and services, and adversely impact our operations and financial condition. These risks include, but are not limited to:

##TABLE_START &#9679; (i) epidemics or pandemics, including the effects of related public health concerns that may cause business disruptions, disrupt the oil and gas industry and global supply chains, negatively impact the global economy, reduce global demand for oil and gas and create significant volatility and disruption of financial and commodity markets; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; (ii) the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the United States or other countries, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the United States or other countries, including continued hostilities around the globe, such as the war between Ukraine and Russia, the conflict between Israel and Hamas, and the regional conflict in the Middle East. ##TABLE_END 

The degree to which events outside of our control adversely impact our results will also depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. These and other factors can, individually or collectively contribute to unprecedented negative global economic impacts, including a significant decrease in demand. While we expect these matters discussed above will continue to disrupt our operations in some way, the degree of the adverse financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

Combining our business with MER&#8217;s may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected and the combined company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the contribution, which may adversely affect the combined company&#8217;s business results and negatively affect the value of our Class A common stock. 

The success of the contribution will depend on, among other things, the ability of the two companies to combine their businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes expected cost savings. The combined company may encounter difficulties in integrating each business and realizing the anticipated benefits of the contribution. The combined company must achieve the anticipated improvement in free cash flow generation and returns and achieve the planned cost savings without adversely affecting current revenues and operations. If the combined company is not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the benefits of the contribution may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.

The contribution involved the combination of two companies which operated, until the completion of the contribution, as independent companies. There can be no assurances that the businesses will be integrated successfully. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees from both companies; the loss of commercial and vendor partners; the disruption of ongoing business; inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies; unexpected integration issues; higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated.

The combined company will be required to devote management attention and resources to integrating its business practices and operations. An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the contribution and the other transactions contemplated by the definitive agreement, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect upon the revenues, level of expenses and operating results of the combined company, which may adversely affect the value of the common stock of the combined company.

In addition, integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the benefits of the integration plan may not be realized. There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations and technologies and systems that are being integrated in connection with the contribution and the integration of MER&#8217;s business. We expect the elimination of duplicative costs, strategic benefits, and additional income, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the business, to offset incremental transaction and contribution-related costs over time. However, any net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all. If we are not able to adequately address 

integration challenges, we may be unable to successfully integrate operations or realize the anticipated benefits of the integration of the two companies.

We may grow through acquisitions and our failure to properly plan and manage those acquisitions may adversely affect our performance. 

We have completed and may, in the future, pursue asset acquisitions or acquisitions of businesses. We must plan and manage any acquisitions and integrations effectively to achieve revenue growth and maintain profitability in our evolving market. If we fail to manage acquisitions and integrations effectively, our results of operations could be adversely affected.

We engage in transactions with related parties and such transactions present possible conflicts of interest that could have an adverse effect on us. 

We have entered into transactions with related parties. The details of certain of these transactions are set forth in Note 18. &#8220;Related Party Transactions&#8221; under Part II, Item 8. &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; Related party transactions create the possibility of conflicts of interest with regard to our management or directors. Such a conflict could cause an individual in our management or on our board of directors to seek to advance his or her economic interests above ours. Further, the appearance of conflicts of interest created by related party transactions could impair the confidence of our investors. Our board of directors, or a committee thereof, regularly reviews these transactions. Notwithstanding this, it is possible that a conflict of interest could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.

Our failure to protect our proprietary information and intellectual property rights, or any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us, could result in a loss in our competitive advantage or market share. 

Because of the technical nature of our business, we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property. We also rely on third-party intellectual property licenses in connection with our business. We may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights in the future or they may be invalidated. Third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our patents or other proprietary rights, third parties may challenge patents or proprietary rights held by us, and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved. It is possible that our competitors or others could independently develop the same or similar technologies or otherwise obtain access to our unpatented technologies. Policing unauthorized use of intellectual property rights can be difficult and expensive, and adequate remedies may not be available. Alternatively, third parties may initiate litigation against us by asserting that the conduct of our business infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates intellectual property rights and we may be required to obtain necessary licenses or substantially re-engineer our products in order to avoid infringement. Failure to protect, monitor and control the use of our existing intellectual property rights or any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive advantage and result in us being enjoined from using or offering such products or technology and cause us to incur significant expenses. 

Technological advancements in the products and technologies we provide could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The markets in which we operate are characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. As competitors and others use or develop new technologies, or technologies comparable to ours, in the future, we may lose market share or be placed at a competitive disadvantage. Further, we may face competitive pressure to implement or acquire certain new technologies at a substantial cost. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources than we do, which may allow them to gain technological advantages or implement new technologies more rapidly than us. Limits on our ability to effectively use, implement or adapt to new technologies may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, the sustainability of the favorable supply-demand dynamic in the power sector depends on multiple factors, including factors relating to technological advancements such as continued demand growth for generative AI computing applications, cloud computing, the level and pace at which the power industry can invest in power infrastructure and the pace of continued electrification-driven demand growth.

We are subject to cybersecurity risks. A cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss. 

The industries we service have become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain processing activities. For example, we depend on digital information and operational technologies to perform many of our services and to process and record financial and operating data and to collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our employees. At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks, have increased. The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cybersecurity threats. Our technologies, systems and networks, and those of our vendors, suppliers and other business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches in the future that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. Despite the implementation of our cybersecurity processes, our security measures cannot guarantee that a significant cyberattack will not occur. As cyber incidents continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all the losses (including potential reputational loss) or expenses we may experience as a result of such cyberattacks. Any cyberattacks that affect our facilities or systems, or those of third parties with whom we do business, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business, cause us a material financial loss and materially damage our reputation.

We rely on a few key employees whose absence or loss could adversely affect our business. 

Many key responsibilities within our business have been assigned to a small number of employees, including within our Power Solutions segment. The loss of their services, whether permanently or temporarily could adversely affect our business. We do not have any written employment agreements with our executives at this time. Further, we do not maintain ""key person"" life insurance policies on any of our employees. As a result, we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of our key employees. 

If we are unable to access the services of a sufficient number of skilled and qualified workers, or are required to significantly increase wages to attract or retain such workers, our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired. 

&#8203; 

The manufacture and delivery of our products and performance of our services requires skilled and qualified workers with specialized skills and experience who can perform physically demanding work. As a result of the volatility of the industries we service and the demanding nature of the work, workers may choose to pursue employment in fields that offer a more desirable work environment at wage rates that are competitive. Increased competition for their services could result in a loss of available, skilled workers or at a price that is not as advantageous to our business, both of which could negatively affect our operating results. Though our historical turnover rates have been significantly lower than those of our competitors, if we are unable to retain or meet growing demand for skilled technical personnel, our operating results and our ability to execute our growth strategies may be adversely affected. 

&#8203; 

We are subject to extensive government laws and regulations concerning our employees, and the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations could be material. 

&#8203; 

Regulations related to wages and other compensation affect our business. Any appreciable increase in applicable employment laws and regulations, including the statutory minimum wage, exemption levels, or overtime regulations, could result in an increase in labor costs. Such cost increases, or the penalties for failing to comply with such statutory minimums, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our shareholders. Additionally, any changes in employment, benefit plan, tax or labor laws or regulations 

or new regulations proposed from time to time, could have a material adverse effect on our employment practices, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our shareholders.

&#8203; 

Unsatisfactory safety performance may negatively affect our customer relationships and, to the extent we fail to retain existing customers or attract new customers, adversely impact our revenues. 

&#8203; 

Our ability to retain existing customers and attract new business is dependent on many factors, including our ability to demonstrate that we can reliably and safely operate our business in a manner that is consistent with applicable laws, rules and permits, which legal requirements are subject to change. Multiple or particularly severe accidents and high employee turnover can contribute to a deterioration of our safety record. If one or more accidents were to occur in connection with the use of our systems or performance of our services, the affected customer may seek to terminate or cancel its use of our services which could cause us to lose substantial revenues. Furthermore, our ability to attract new customers may be impaired if they elect not to engage us because they view our safety record as unacceptable.

&#8203; 

Risks Related to Financial Condition 

Our business depends on domestic capital spending by the industries we service, and reductions in capital spending could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. 

Our business is directly affected by capital spending to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas in the United States. The oil and natural gas industry is cyclical and historically has experienced periodic downturns in activity. If oil and natural gas prices decline below current levels for an extended period of time, certain of our customers may be unable to pay their vendors and service providers, including us, as a result of the decline in commodity prices. Reduced activity in our areas of operation as a result of decreased capital spending may also have a negative long-term impact on our business, even in an environment of stronger oil and natural gas prices. Any of these conditions or events could adversely affect our operating results. 

Industry conditions are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including, but not limited to:

##TABLE_START &#9679; expected economic returns to E&#38;P companies of new well completions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; global political and economic conditions and supply of and demand for oil and natural gas; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; the level of prices, and expectations about future prices, of oil and natural gas; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production, and inventories; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; the supply of and demand for hydraulic fracturing equipment and consumables in the United States, including the supply and demand for lower emissions hydraulic fracturing equipment; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; the supply of consumables used in hydraulic fracturing, including proppant and water; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; federal, state and local regulation of hydraulic fracturing and exploration and production activities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; laws, regulations and taxes, including the policies of governments regarding the exploration for and production and development of their oil and natural gas reserves; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; the supply and demand dynamics for crude oil and natural gas, which may be impacted by actions of global hydrocarbon producers, including members of OPEC; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; global or national health concerns including health epidemics; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; political or civil unrest in the United States or elsewhere; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; advances in exploration, development and production technologies or in technologies affecting energy consumption; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; the potential acceleration of development of alternative fuels or sources of energy. ##TABLE_END &#8203; 

We may be adversely affected by uncertainty in the global financial markets or the deterioration of the financial condition, and resulting credit risk, of our customers. 

Our future results may be impacted by the uncertainty caused by an economic downturn, weak economic conditions and widespread financial distress, volatility or deterioration in the debt and equity capital markets, inflation, deflation or other adverse economic conditions that may negatively affect us or parties with whom we do business resulting in a reduction in our customers' spending and their non-payment or inability to perform obligations owed to us, such as the 

failure of customers to honor their commitments or the failure of major suppliers to complete orders. Additionally, during times when the natural gas or crude oil markets weaken, our customers are more likely to experience financial difficulties, including being unable to access debt or equity financing, which could result in a reduction in our customers' spending for our systems and services. In addition, increased interest rates, whether resulting from inflationary concerns or otherwise, may prevent our customers from being able to obtain debt financing at favorable rates, or at all. Our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to fully reduce customer credit risk. If we are unable to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers or unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness, any resulting bankruptcy or increase in nonpayment or nonperformance by them and our inability to re-market or otherwise use our equipment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations.

&#8203; 

Our financing agreements subject us to various financial and other restrictive covenants. These restrictions may limit our operational or financial flexibility and could subject us to potential defaults under our financing agreements. 

Our Credit Agreement subjects us to significant financial and other restrictive covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on incurring additional debt and certain distributions, as well as a certain leverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio we must maintain. Please see Part II, Item 7. &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation&#8212;Debt Agreements.&#8221; Our ability to comply with these financial condition tests can be affected by events beyond our control. If we are unable to remain in compliance with the financial covenants of our Credit Agreement, then amounts outstanding thereunder may be accelerated and become due immediately or we may be unable to access the funds available. Any such acceleration could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

Our ability to use our net operating loss (&#8220;NOL&#8221;) carryovers may be limited. 

As of December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $260.1 million of U.S. federal NOL carryovers and $57.0 million of state NOL carryovers. $207.3 million of our U.S. federal NOL carryovers have no expiration date and the remaining U.S. federal NOL carryovers expire in 2037. $29.9 million of our state NOL carryovers will expire in varying amounts beginning in 2037. Utilization of our NOLs depends on many factors, including our future income, which cannot be assured. In addition, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of NOLs that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; (as determined under Section 382 of the Code). In the event that an ownership change has occurred, or were to occur, with respect to us, utilization of our NOLs would be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 of the Code. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years. If we were to undergo an ownership change, some of our U.S. federal NOLs could expire before they can be used. In addition, future ownership changes or changes to the U.S. tax laws could limit our ability to utilize our NOLs. To the extent we are not able to offset our future income with our NOLs, this could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.

We incurred significant additional indebtedness in connection with the MER Acquisition and may incur additional indebtedness in the future, and such indebtedness may limit our operating or financial flexibility and could subject us to potential defaults under the applicable financing agreements. 

Upon closing of the MER Acquisition, we entered into a senior secured term loan agreement (the &#8220;Term Loan Agreement&#8221;) in the principal amount of $325 million to fund the MER Acquisition and the capital commitments contemplated at the acquisition closing date. We also entered into a new revolving credit facility, which provides for borrowings up to the lesser of $75 million and a borrowing base determined by a percentage of eligible accounts. These financing agreements could have negative consequences for us, including, among other things, (i) requiring us to dedicate a larger portion of cash flows from operations to servicing and repayment of the debt, (ii) reducing funds available for strategic initiatives and opportunities, working capital and other general corporate needs, (iii) limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, which could restrict flexibility to react to changes in the business, its industry and its economic condition following the contribution, and (iv) placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt.

Additionally, the financing agreements subject us to significant financial and other restrictive covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on incurring additional debt and certain distributions, as well as a certain leverage and 

minimum fixed charge coverage ratios we must maintain. Our ability to comply with these financial condition tests can be affected by events beyond our control. If we are unable to remain in compliance with the financial covenants of the financing agreements, then amounts outstanding thereunder may be accelerated and become due immediately or we may be unable to access the funds available. Any such acceleration or unavailability of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Risks Related to Regulatory Matters 

Laws, regulations, executive orders and other regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could increase our and our customers&#8217; costs of doing business and result in restrictions, delays or cancellations that may serve to limit future oil and natural gas exploration and production activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Although we do not directly engage in hydraulic fracturing, our operational services support our E&#38;P customers in such activities. The practice continues to be controversial, resulting in increased scrutiny and regulation of the hydraulic fracturing process, including by federal and state agencies and local municipalities. Additionally, with concerns about seismic activity being triggered by the injection of produced wastewaters into underground disposal wells, certain regulators are also considering or have adopted additional requirements related to seismic safety for hydraulic fracturing activities. Our customers' inability to locate or contractually acquire and sustain the receipt of sufficient amounts of water could also adversely impact their exploration and production operations and result in a corresponding reduction in demand for our services. See Part I, Item 1. &#8220;Business &#8211; Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations&#8221; for more discussion on these hydraulic fracturing, seismicity and water availability matters. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations or issuance of executive orders regarding hydraulic fracturing, seismic activities, or leasing activities on federal properties, or the inability of our customers to maintain adequate water supplies could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and an associated decrease in demand for our services and increased compliance costs and time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 

We are subject to environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities. 

Our operations and the operations of our customers are subject to stringent federal, tribal, state and local laws and regulations governing worker health and safety, protection of the environment, including natural resources, endangered or threatened species or their habitat and migratory birds, and the management, transportation and disposal of wastes and other materials. In addition, our business activities present risks of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities, including costs and liabilities resulting from our management, transportation and disposal of regulated materials, such as oilfield and other wastes, air emissions and wastewater discharges related to our operations, and due to historical oilfield industry operations and waste disposal practices at locations where we operate (in certain circumstances, regardless of fault or contribution). Additionally, our operations are subject to legal requirements whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of our workers including, for example, standards relating to human exposure to crystalline silica as a result of hydraulic fracturing-related activities. Failure to comply with environmental and occupational safety laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial and curative requirements or the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting, development or expansion of projects and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations in affected areas. See Part I, Item 1. &#8220;Business &#8211; Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations&#8221; for more discussion on these matters.

Our costs to comply with existing or any new environmental or occupational health and safety laws, regulations and executive actions could impact us and our customers, increase the costs associated with our business or reduce demand for our services, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

&#8203; 

Our and our customers' operations are subject to a number of risks arising out of the threat of climate change, energy conservation measures or initiatives that stimulate demand for alternative forms of energy that could result in increased operating and capital costs for our customers and reduced demand for the products and services we provide. 

The threat of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and around the world. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government related to restricting or phasing out the production and processing of fossil fuels, the monitoring and reporting of, or regulation of GHG emissions, and advancing or subsidizing alternative sources of energy. For example, the IRA 2022 appropriated significant federal funding for renewable energy initiatives and incentives and imposed the first-ever federal fee on excess methane emissions from certain oil and gas facilities. These and other actions could accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, therefore reducing demand for our products and services. Moreover, climate change-related regulatory initiatives to reduce carbon-based emissions may result in fuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements and increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas, which could reduce demand for the oil and natural gas our customers produce and reduce the demand for our products and services. Certain states have also enacted or are otherwise considering a variety of climate-related disclosure requirements, GHG emissions limitation programs, mitigation funds, and other related regulations and policy initiatives. Various federal agencies have also promulgated final rules for the monitoring, reporting, or restriction of GHG emissions or have otherwise incorporated climate change considerations into their policy-setting and rulemaking procedures and decisions. Some states, localities, and other plaintiffs have sought to bring about further climate-related regulations or obtain compensation and/or adaption funding for alleged climate-related damages by filing lawsuits against government entities and certain fossil fuel energy companies. Moreover, our and our customers&#8217; access to capital could be adversely impacted to the extent certain financial institutions or investors reduce their investments in fossil fuel-related businesses due to climate change or energy transition concerns. Whether and how the incoming Trump Administration or U.S. Congress will revise existing climate-related laws and regulations or impact climate-related financial and societal trends and initiatives is uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. See Part I, Item 1. &#8220;Business &#8211; Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations&#8221; for more discussion on the impact of climate-related initiatives and the restriction of GHG emissions. The adoption and implementation of any international, federal, regional or state legislation, executive actions, regulations or other regulatory and policy initiatives that impose more stringent standards that restrict the areas in which this sector may produce oil and natural gas or generate GHG emissions could result in increased compliance costs or costs of consuming fossil fuels, which could reduce demand for our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and revenues.

Increased attention to environmental, social and governance (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) matters may impact our business. 

Increased attention to ESG matters, including increasing societal expectations on companies to address climate change, increasing investor scrutiny of corporate governance and social dynamics, and shifts in the consumer demand for fossil fuel alternatives, may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our customers&#8217; hydrocarbon products and our products and services, reduced profits, increased governmental investigations and private litigation against us, and may have negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets.

Moreover, while we may create and publish voluntary disclosures regarding sustainability-related matters from time to time, many of the statements in those voluntary disclosures are based on expectations and assumptions or hypothetical scenarios that may or may not be representative of current or actual risks or events or forecasts of expected risks or events, including the costs associated therewith. Such expectations and assumptions or hypothetical scenarios are necessarily uncertain and may be prone to error or subject to misinterpretation given the long timelines involved and the lack of an established approach to identifying, measuring and reporting on many sustainability-related matters. We may also announce participation in, or certification under, various third-party sustainability or climate-related frameworks in an attempt to improve our sustainability profile, but such participation or certification may be costly and may not achieve the desired results. 

As part of our ongoing effort to enhance our ESG practices, management regularly reports to our board of directors regarding our ESG policies. The goal is to integrate actions taken currently by us regarding ESG issues, to assure corporate governance for a complex assessment of the environmental and social impact of our products and activities, 

and to set a framework for the identification of sustainable development risks. While we may elect to seek out various voluntary ESG targets now or in the future, such targets are often aspirational. We may not be able to meet such targets in the manner or on such a timeline as initially contemplated, including as a result of unforeseen costs or technical difficulties associated with achieving such results. To the extent we elected to pursue such targets and were able to achieve the desired target levels or any associated interim milestones, such achievement may have been accomplished as a result of entering into various contractual arrangements, including the purchase of various credits or offsets that may be deemed to mitigate our ESG impact instead of actual changes in our ESG performance. However, we cannot guarantee that there will be sufficient credits or offsets available for purchase given the increased demand from numerous businesses implementing net zero goals, or that, notwithstanding our reliance on any reputable third-party registries, that the credits or offsets we do purchase will successfully achieve the emissions reductions they represent. Some of these arrangements may receive scrutiny from certain constituencies who criticize the methodology of credits or offsets or do not believe credits or offsets should be utilized to neutralize GHG emissions. Notwithstanding our election to pursue any aspirational targets now or in the future, we may receive pressure from investors, lenders or other groups to adopt more aggressive climate or other ESG-related goals, but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to pursue or implement such goals because of potential costs or technical or operational obstacles. 

In addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. While such ratings do not impact all investors&#8217; investment or voting decisions, unfavorable ESG ratings may lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward us or our customers and to the diversion of investment to other industries which could have a negative impact on our stock price and/or our access to and costs of capital. Also, institutional lenders may decide not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies or the corresponding infrastructure projects based on climate change-related concerns, which could affect our or our customers&#8217; access to capital for potential growth projects, which can adversely affect our business. Further, while we may participate in various voluntary frameworks and certification programs to improve the ESG profile of our operations and products, we cannot guarantee that such participation or certification will have the intended results on our or our products&#8217; ESG profile. Such ESG matters may also impact our customers, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Furthermore, certain public statements with respect to ESG-related matters, such as emissions reduction goals, other environmental targets, or other commitments addressing certain social issues, are becoming increasingly subject to heightened scrutiny from public and governmental authorities, as well as other parties, related to the risk of potential &#8220;greenwashing,&#8221; ( i.e. , misleading information or false claims overstating potential benefits). For example, the SEC has recently taken enforcement action against companies for ESG-related misconduct, including greenwashing. Certain regulators, such as the SEC and various state agencies, as well as non-governmental organizations and other private actors have also filed lawsuits under various securities and consumer protection laws alleging that certain ESG-statements, goals or standards were misleading, false or otherwise deceptive. In addition, any alleged claims of greenwashing against us or others in our industry may lead to further negative sentiment and diversion of investments. Additionally, certain employment practices and social initiatives are the subject of scrutiny by both those calling for the continued advancement of such policies, as well as those who believe they should be curbed, including government actors, and the complex regulatory and legal frameworks applicable to such initiatives continue to evolve. We cannot be certain of the impact of such regulatory, legal and other developments on our business. More recent political developments could mean that the Company faces increasing criticism or litigation risks from certain &#8220;anti-ESG&#8221; parties, including various governmental agencies. Such sentiment may focus on the Company&#8217;s environmental commitments (such as reducing GHG emissions) or its pursuit of certain employment practices or social initiatives that are alleged to be political or polarizing in nature or are alleged to violate laws based, in part, on changing priorities of, or interpretations by, federal agencies or state governments. Consideration of ESG-related factors in the Company&#8217;s decision-making could be subject to increasing scrutiny and objection from such anti-ESG parties. As a result, we may face increased litigation risk from private parties and governmental authorities related to our ESG-related efforts. We could face increasing costs as we attempt to comply with and navigate further regulatory ESG-related focus and scrutiny. 

Anti-indemnity provisions enacted by many states may restrict or prohibit a party's indemnification of us. 

We typically enter into agreements with our customers governing the use and operation of our systems and services, which usually include certain indemnification provisions for losses resulting from operations. Such agreements may 

require each party to indemnify the other against certain claims regardless of the negligence or other fault of the indemnified party; however, many states place limitations on contractual indemnity agreements, particularly agreements that indemnify a party against the consequences of its own negligence. Furthermore, certain states, including Louisiana, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming have enacted statutes generally referred to as ""oilfield anti-indemnity acts"" expressly prohibiting certain indemnity agreements contained in or related to oilfield services agreements. Such anti-indemnity acts may restrict or void a party's indemnification of us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.

Changes to applicable tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our operating results and cash flows. 

We are subject to various complex and evolving U.S. federal, state and local tax laws. U.S. federal, state and local tax laws, policies, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us, in each case, possibly with retroactive effect. Any significant variance in our interpretation of current tax laws or a successful challenge of one or more of our tax positions by the Internal Revenue Service or other tax authorities could increase our future tax liabilities and have an adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows.

Risks Related to Our Class A Common Stock 

Solaris Inc. is a holding company. Solaris Inc.&#8217;s sole material asset is its equity interest in Solaris LLC and Solaris Inc. is accordingly dependent upon distributions from Solaris LLC to pay taxes, make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and cover its corporate and other overhead expenses. 

Solaris Inc. is a holding company and has no material assets other than its equity interest in Solaris LLC. Solaris Inc. has no independent means of generating revenue. To the extent that Solaris Inc. needs funds, including to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement (as defined below), and Solaris LLC or its subsidiaries are restricted from making such distributions or payments under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of the Credit Agreement or any future financing arrangements, or are otherwise unable to provide such funds, Solaris Inc.&#8217;s liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

Our stock price could be volatile, and you may not be able to resell shares of your Class A common stock at or above the price you paid. 

The stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, the market price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors outside of our control, including public reaction to our releases and filings, actions by our competitors and actions by our stockholders. Additionally, if our results fail to meet analyst expectations or if analysts cease coverage of our Company, fail to publish reports on us regularly, or downgrade our Class A common stock, our stock price or trading volume could decline. Volatility in the market price of our Class A common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your Class A common stock at or above the price at which you purchased the stock. As a result, you may suffer a loss on your investment. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company's securities. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs, divert our management's attention and resources and harm our business, operating results and financial condition. 

The market price for our Class A common stock following the closing the MER Acquisition may be affected by factors different from those that historically have affected or currently affect our Class A common stock. 

Our results of operations following the completion of the MER Acquisition may be affected by some factors that are different from those that have affected our results of operations in the past. Accordingly, the market price and performance of our Class A common stock is likely to be different from the performance of our Class A common stock in the absence of the MER Acquisition. In addition, general fluctuations in stock markets could have a material adverse effect on the market for, or liquidity of, our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.

Future sales of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could reduce our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us. 

We may sell additional shares of our Class A common stock in subsequent offerings. In addition, subject to certain limitations and exceptions, the holders of interest in Solaris LLC may redeem their non-controlling interest related to the portion of the units in Solaris LLC (&#8220;Solaris LLC Units&#8221;) (together with a corresponding number of shares of Class B common stock) for shares of Class A common stock (on a one-for-one basis, subject to conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassification and other similar transactions) and then sell those shares of Class A common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Class A common stock. 

Certain holders of our shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, including Yorktown Energy Partners X, L.P. (&#8220;Yorktown&#8221;) and Solaris Energy Capital, LLC, the legacy equity holders of MER and certain members of our management team, are entitled to rights with respect to registration of approximately 29 million shares of our Class A common stock, including as a result of conversion of shares of Class B common stock for an equal amount of Class A common stock (representing approximately 75% of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock as of February 26, 2025) under the Securities Act pursuant to certain registration rights agreements. Although the legacy equity holders of MER continue to be subject to selling restrictions through March 11, 2025, if these holders, along with other stockholders with whom we have granted registration rights, exercise their registration rights and sell a large number of shares, the market price for our shares of Class A common stock could be adversely affected.

Holders of our Class A common stock may not receive dividends on our Class A common stock. 

We declared our first dividend to Class A stockholders in the fourth quarter of 2018 and have continued to declare dividends on a quarterly basis. See Part II, Item 5. &#8220;Market for Registrant&#8217;s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities&#8221; of this Annual Report. We are not required to declare future dividends and holders of our Class A common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our board of directors may declare. Any determination to pay dividends and other distributions in cash, stock or property by us in the future will be dependent on then-existing conditions, including business conditions, our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital requirements, contractual restrictions including restrictive covenants contained in debt agreements and other factors.

Our principal stockholders collectively hold a significant amount of the voting power of our common stock. 

Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters presented to our stockholders for their vote or approval, except as otherwise required by applicable law or our certificate of incorporation. Yorktown, William A. Zartler and the legacy equity holders of MER own a substantial majority of our Class B common stock, which represents approximately 41% of our combined economic interest and voting power. Although our largest investors are entitled to act separately in their own respective interests with respect to their ownership in us, if they choose to act in concert, they will together have the ability to strongly influence the election of the members of our board of directors, and thereby our management and affairs. In addition, they will be able to strongly influence the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval, including mergers and other material transactions. The existence of significant stockholders may also have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers, delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management, or limiting the ability of our other stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in the best interests of our company. Moreover, this concentration of stock ownership may also adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock to the extent investors perceive a disadvantage in owning stock of a company with a large stockholder.

Certain Designated Parties are not limited in their ability to compete with us, and the corporate opportunity provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation could enable such Designated Parties and their respective affiliates to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us. 

Our governing documents provide that Yorktown, Wells Fargo Central Pacific Holdings, Inc. and our directors who are not also our officers, including William A. Zartler, our Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of our board of directors, and their respective portfolio investments and affiliates (collectively, the ""Designated Parties"") are not restricted from owning assets or engaging in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. In particular, subject to the limitations of applicable law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, among other things:

##TABLE_START &#9679; permits such Designated Parties to conduct business that competes with us and to make investments in any kind of property in which we may make investments; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; provides that if such Designated Parties, or any employee, partner, member, manager, officer or director of such Designated Parties who is also one of our directors, becomes aware of a potential business opportunity, transaction or other matter, they will have no duty to communicate or offer that opportunity to us. ##TABLE_END 

The Designated Parties may become aware, from time to time, of certain business opportunities (such as acquisition opportunities) and may direct such opportunities to other businesses in which they have invested, in which case we may not become aware of or otherwise have the ability to pursue such opportunity. Furthermore, such businesses may choose to compete with us for these opportunities, possibly causing these opportunities to not be available to us or causing them to be more expensive for us to pursue. In addition, the Designated Parties may dispose of oil and natural gas service assets in the future, without any obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase any of those assets. As a result, our renouncing our interest and expectancy in any business opportunity that may be from time to time presented to the Designated Parties could adversely impact our business or prospects if attractive business opportunities are procured by such parties for their own benefit rather than for ours or become more expensive for us to pursue.

Certain of our directors, including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, have significant duties with, and spend significant time serving, entities that may or may not compete with us and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating time or pursuing business opportunities. 

Certain of our executive officers and directors, who are responsible for managing the direction of our operations, hold positions of responsibility with other entities (including affiliated entities) that are in the industries we service. These executive officers and directors may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time between these entities or whether to present potential business opportunities to other entities prior to presenting them to us, which could cause additional conflicts of interest. They may also decide that certain opportunities are more appropriate for other entities with which they are affiliated, and as a result, they may elect not to present those opportunities to us. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor. For additional discussion of our executive officers and directors' business affiliations and the potential conflicts of interest of which our stockholders should be aware, see Note 18. &#8220;Related Party Transactions&#8221; under Part II, Item 8. &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221;

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock and could deprive our investors of the opportunity to receive a premium for their shares. 

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our Class A common stock respecting dividends, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our Class A common stock. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the Class A common stock.

If our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, some provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions include, among other things: a staggered, or classified, board of directors; permitting the majority of directors then in office, even if less than a majority, the right to fill vacancies; restricting the ability of stockholders to act by written consent or call special meetings of stockholders; supermajority requirements (75%) to remove directors from office; prohibitions on cumulative voting of directors; advance notice requirements for stockholders proposals; and express power to our board of directors to adopt, or alter or repeal our bylaws.

In addition, certain change of control events have the effect of accelerating the payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which could be substantial and accordingly serve as a disincentive to a potential acquirer of our company. Please see &#8220;&#8212;In certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits, if any, Solaris Inc. realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.&#8221;

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents. 

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to actions arising under the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. However, Section 22 of the Securities Act provides for concurrent federal and state court jurisdiction over actions under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, subject to a limited exception for certain &#8220;covered class actions&#8221; as defined in Section 16 of the Securities Act and interpreted by the courts. Accordingly, we believe that the exclusive forum provision would apply to actions arising under the Securities Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except to the extent a particular action fell within the exception for covered class actions or the exception in the certificate of incorporation described above otherwise applied to such action, which could occur if the action also involved claims under the Exchange Act. Stockholders will not be deemed, by operation of Article 14 of the certificate of incorporation alone, to have waived claims arising under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. 

Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Solaris Inc. will be required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for certain tax benefits that it may claim, and the amounts of such payments could be significant. 

In connection with the closing of its initial public offering (&#8220;IPO&#8221;), Solaris Inc. entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with the other then-existing members of Solaris LLC (each such person and any permitted transferee, a &#8220;TRA Holder,&#8221; and together, the &#8220;TRA Holders&#8221;). For additional information, see &#8220;Payables Related to the Tax 

Receivable Agreement&#8221; in Note 15. &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221; and Note 18. &#8220;Related Party Transactions&#8221; under Part II, Item 8. &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221; The term of the Tax Receivable Agreement will continue until all tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement have been utilized or expired, unless Solaris Inc. exercises its right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement (or the Tax Receivable Agreement is terminated due to other circumstances, including Solaris Inc.&#8217;s breach of a material obligation thereunder or certain mergers, asset sales or other forms of business combinations or other changes of control), and Solaris Inc. makes the termination payment specified in the Tax Receivable Agreement. 

Estimating the amount and timing of payments that may become due under the Tax Receivable Agreement is by its nature imprecise. For purposes of the Tax Receivable Agreement, cash savings in tax generally are calculated by comparing Solaris Inc.&#8217;s actual tax liability (determined by using the actual applicable United States federal income tax rate and an assumed combined state and local income and franchise tax rate) to the amount Solaris Inc. would have been required to pay had it not been able to utilize any of the tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. The actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of any redemption of Solaris LLC Units, the price of Solaris Inc.&#8217;s Class A common stock at the time of each redemption, the extent to which such redemptions are taxable transactions, the amount and timing of the taxable income Solaris Inc. generates in the future, the United States federal income tax rates then applicable, and the portion of Solaris Inc.&#8217;s payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that constitute imputed interest or give rise to depreciable or amortizable tax basis.

The payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement are Solaris Inc.&#8217;s obligations and not obligations of Solaris LLC, and Solaris Inc. expects that the payments it will be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be substantial. The payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are not conditioned upon a holder of rights under the Tax Receivable Agreement having a continued ownership interest in Solaris Inc. or Solaris LLC. Solaris LLC may make tax distributions to Solaris Inc. in order for Solaris Inc. to satisfy its obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement and will be required to distribute cash pro rata to each of the other members of Solaris LLC, in accordance with the number of Solaris LLC Units owned by each member at that time. For additional information regarding the Tax Receivable Agreement, see Note 15. &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221; under Part II, Item 8. &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.&#8221;

In certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits, if any, Solaris Inc. realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. 

If we experience a change of control (as defined in the Tax Receivable Agreement), which includes certain mergers, asset sales and other forms of business combinations, or the Tax Receivable Agreement terminates early, we would be required to make a substantial, immediate lump-sum payment. This payment would equal the present value of hypothetical future payments that could be required to be paid under the Tax Receivable Agreement (determined by applying a discount rate equal to the 12-month term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) published by CME Group Benchmark Administration Limited plus 71.513 basis points). The calculation of hypothetical future payments will be based upon certain assumptions and deemed events set forth in the Tax Receivable Agreement, including that (i) Solaris Inc. has sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the tax benefits covered by the Tax Receivable Agreement (including having sufficient taxable income to currently utilize any accumulated NOL carryforwards) and (ii) any Solaris LLC Units (other than those held by Solaris Inc.) outstanding on the termination date are deemed to be redeemed on the termination date. Any early termination payment may be made significantly in advance of, and may materially exceed, the actual realization, if any, of the future tax benefits to which the termination payment relates. If we experience a change of control, such potential termination payment could have a substantial negative impact on Solaris Inc.&#8217;s liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales or other forms of business combinations or changes of control. 

For example, if the Tax Receivable Agreement were terminated immediately after the filing of this Annual Report the estimated termination payments would, in the aggregate, be approximately $115.6 million (calculated using a discount rate equal to the 12-month term SOFR published by CME Group Benchmark Limited plus 71.513 basis points, applied against an undiscounted liability of $163.8 million, based upon the last reported closing sale price of our Class A common stock on December 31, 2024). The foregoing number is merely an estimate and the actual payment could differ 

materially. There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Please read Note 15. &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221; under Part II, Item 8. &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; for additional information. 

Additionally, holders of our Class A common stock could receive substantially less consideration in connection with a change of control transaction than they would receive in the absence of such obligation. Further, Solaris Inc.&#8217;s payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement will not be conditioned upon the TRA Holders having a continued interest in Solaris Inc. or Solaris LLC. Accordingly, the TRA Holders' interests may conflict with those of the holders of our Class A common stock. 

Finally, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that we will determine. The TRA Holders will not reimburse us for any payments previously made under the Tax Receivable Agreement if any tax benefits that have given rise to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are subsequently disallowed. As a result, in such circumstances, we could make payments that are greater than our actual cash tax savings, if any, and may not be able to recoup those payments, which could adversely affect our liquidity.

The requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner. 

As a public company, we need to comply with laws, regulations and requirements, certain corporate governance provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the &#8220;Sarbanes-Oxley Act&#8221;) and related regulations of the SEC and the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (the &#8220;NYSE&#8221;). Complying with these statutes, regulations and requirements occupies a significant amount of time of our board of directors and management and significantly increases our costs and expenses.

Under Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is required to assess and report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and identify any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. In compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls. Our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed. Compliance with these requirements may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.

Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may also be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If material weaknesses are discovered in the future, the Company&#8217;s financial statements could contain additional errors which, in turn, could lead to errors in our financial reports and/or delays in our financial reporting, which could require us to further restate our operating results. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, being a public company subject to these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. 

Additionally, as a public company, we are required to: (i) comply with any new requirements if adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer; (ii) provide certain disclosures regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies; or (iii) hold nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation.

Risk Factors 

Risks Related to Our Business 

Disruptions in the worldwide economy, including an economic recession, downturn, periods of rising or high inflation or economic uncertainty, have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

The global economy can be negatively impacted by a variety of factors such as the spread or fear of spread of contagious diseases (such as the COVID-19 pandemic, other pandemics, epidemics or other public health crises) in locations where our products are sold, man-made or natural disasters, severe weather, actual or threatened hostilities or war, terrorist activity, political unrest or uncertainties (including those resulting from the recent U.S. presidential and congressional elections), civil strife and other geopolitical uncertainty. Such adverse and uncertain economic conditions may impact distributor, retailer, foodservice and consumer demand for our products. For example, in connection with the war in Ukraine, governments in the U.S., U.K. and the EU have each imposed export controls on certain products and financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia. In addition, the intensity, duration and economic effects of the conflict in Israel, Gaza and surrounding areas are difficult to predict. The uncertainty resulting from the military conflicts in Europe and the Middle East have given rise and may continue to give rise to increases in costs of goods and services, scarcity of certain ingredients, increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade and may increase volatility in financial and capital markets, which may make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital. Further escalation of geopolitical tensions could have a broader impact that expands into other markets 

where we do business, which could adversely affect our business and/or our supply chain, our international subsidiaries, business partners or customers in the broader region, including potential destabilizing effects that such conflicts may pose for the European continent, the Middle East or the global oil and natural gas markets. In addition, our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors, retailers, foodservice customers, consumers and creditors may suffer. Political environments, for example the recent change in administration in the U.S., may create uncertainty with respect to, and could result in additional changes in, legislation, regulation, international relations and government policy, or could result in possible civil unrest or other disturbances. 

The United States has recently signaled its intention to change U.S. trade policy, including potentially renegotiating or terminating existing trade agreements and leveraging tariffs. For example, the current U.S. presidential administration recently announced the implementation of a 25% additional tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 20% additional tariff on imports from China. In response to the U.S. tariffs, China, Canada and Mexico announced plans for their own tariffs on American products. If such increased or additional tariffs or other restrictions, quotas, embargoes, or safeguards are placed on goods imported into the United States, or any related counter-measures are taken by other countries, we may have to raise our prices or increase inventory levels, or find new sources of supply for products that we import. There is no assurance that we would be able to pass on any cost increases, in full or at all, to our customers, and/or we could lose customers in countries such as Canada due to anti-American sentiment, any of which could materially affect our revenue, gross margin and results of operations. 

Any trade wars, through the implementation of tariffs or otherwise, or a government&#8217;s adoption of &#8220;buy national&#8221; policies or retaliation by another government against such tariffs or policies may adversely affect our business, including by impacting (a) our supply chain for our operations as well as third parties with whom we do business, (b) negatively affecting the prices of and demand for the Company&#8217;s products and (c) the macroeconomic markets at large. For example, we source substantially all of our pea protein and manufacture some of our products in Canada and such ingredients and products may be subject to tariffs upon import into the U.S., which may negatively impact prices and demand for our products. In addition, prices and demand for our products manufactured in the U.S. may also be negatively affected by trade wars. 

We cannot predict future trade policy and regulations in the United States and other countries, the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements or treaties, or tariffs and their impact on our business. A trade war could have a significant adverse effect on world trade and the world economy. To the extent that trade tariffs and other restrictions imposed by the United States or other countries increase the price of, or limit the amount of, our products or raw materials used in our products imported into the United States or other countries, or create adverse tax consequences, the sales, cost or gross margin of our products may be adversely affected and the demand from our customers for products may be diminished. Uncertainty surrounding international trade policy and regulations as well as disputes and protectionist measures could also have an adverse effect on consumer confidence and spending. 

As global economic conditions continue to be volatile or uncertain and potential recessionary or inflationary pressures exist, trends in consumer discretionary spending also remain unpredictable and subject to changes. We have seen consumers shift purchases to lower-priced or other perceived value offerings during economic downturns as a result of various factors, including job losses, inflation, higher taxes, reduced access to credit, change in federal economic policy and recent international trade disputes. In particular, consumers have reduced the amount of plant-based food products that they purchase where there are conventional animal-based protein offerings, which generally have lower retail prices. In addition, consumers may choose to purchase private label products rather than branded products because they are generally less expensive. A decrease in consumer discretionary spending may also result in consumers reducing the frequency and amount spent on food prepared away from home. Distributors, retailers and foodservice customers have become more conservative in response to these conditions and have sought to reduce their inventories. Our results of operations depend upon, among other things, our ability to maintain and increase sales volume with our existing distributors, retailers and foodservice customers, our ability to attract new consumers, the financial condition of our consumers and our ability to provide products that appeal to consumers at the right price. Decreases in 

demand for our products without a corresponding decrease in costs has put downward pressure on gross margin and has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, our financial results. Prolonged unfavorable economic conditions or uncertainty would likely have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability. 

We have a history of losses, and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability. 

We have experienced net losses in almost every period since our inception. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, we incurred net losses of $160.3 million, $338.1 million and $366.1 million, respectively. Although we decreased our operating expenses year-over-year in 2024 and 2023, over time our operating expenses and capital expenditures may increase as we hire additional employees; support our strategic and other QSR customer relationships; innovate and commercialize products; build our brand, expand our marketing channels and drive consumer adoption of our products; optimize our production capacity through our own internal production facilities, domestically and abroad; continue building out our Campus Headquarters, including the timing and success of subleasing, assigning or otherwise transferring excess space or negotiating a partial lease termination at our Campus Headquarters on terms advantageous to us or at all; increase our customer base, supplier network and co-manufacturing partners; scale production across distribution channels; pursue geographic expansion; and enhance our technology and production capabilities. These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenues and margins sufficiently to offset the anticipated higher expenses, particularly in light of some of the other challenges we face, for example prolonged, weakened demand within the plant-based meat category and broad macroeconomic headwinds. We incur significant expenses in developing our innovative products, building out our facilities, securing an adequate supply of raw materials, obtaining and storing ingredients and other products, and marketing the products we offer. In addition, many of our expenses, including some of the costs associated with our existing and any future manufacturing facilities, are fixed. Accordingly, we may not be able to successfully implement our long-term growth strategy or achieve or sustain profitability, and we may incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. 

Weakness in the plant-based meat category, combined with our volume losses, has had a negative impact on our sales and profits. 

Our operating environment continues to be negatively affected by several challenges, including, but not limited to, prolonged, weakened demand in the plant-based meat category overall, particularly in the refrigerated subsegment, among others, adverse changes in consumer taste and perceptions about plant-based meat, broad macroeconomic headwinds including elevated levels of inflation, higher interest rates, waning consumer confidence and potential recessionary concerns, and competitive activity in the plant-based meat category. Consumer demand for plant-based meat products has continued to decline in the U.S. and has softened in certain international markets. 

Partly as a result of this weak demand, we have experienced volume losses and declines from historical levels, which has negatively impacted our sales and profitability. We expect that demand-related challenges will continue to have a negative impact on our sales and profitability and, as a result, our results of operations and financial condition, in the future, particularly if we are not able to continue reducing our costs quickly and significantly enough to offset the lost volume and attain and maintain a profitable customer and product sales mix. A continued decrease in consumer demand for plant-based meat, or a further prolonged decrease, would likely have a material adverse effect on our profits, business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Our strategic initiatives to improve our cost structure could have long-term adverse effects on our business, and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions, including achieving and/or sustaining our profitability and financial performance objectives. 

In November 2023, we initiated our Global Operations Review, which involves narrowing our commercial focus to certain anticipated growth opportunities, and accelerating activities that prioritize gross margin expansion and cash generation. These efforts have to date included, and may in the future include, the exit or discontinuation of select product lines such as Beyond Meat Jerky; changes to our pricing architecture within 

certain channels; cash-accretive inventory reduction initiatives; non-cash charges such as provision for excess and obsolete inventory and potential additional impairment charges, write-offs and disposals of fixed assets, and losses on sale and write-down of fixed assets; further optimization of our manufacturing capacity and real estate footprint; planned and future reductions in our workforce; and the planned suspension of our operational activities in China. 

Our Global Operations Review, cost structure improvement measures, cost-reduction initiatives, workforce reductions, suspension of our operational activities in China, and the timing and success of reducing operating expenses and achieving and/or sustaining our profitability and financial performance objectives are subject to many risks and uncertainties. For example, the charges associated with our recent reductions-in-force may be greater than anticipated, and we may be unable to realize the contemplated benefits of any of the foregoing. Additionally, our ability to make progress toward reducing operating expenses and achieving and/or sustaining our profitability and financial performance objectives is dependent on a number of assumptions and uncertainties, including, without limitation, demand in the plant-based meat category and for our products, which has continued to decline; our ability to both raise capital and reduce costs and achieve and/or sustain positive gross margin; our ability to grow revenues and meet operating expense reduction targets, which may be subject to factors beyond our control; timing of capital expenditures; and our ability to monetize inventory and manage working capital. The other risks described in this report may also hinder our ability to implement our strategic initiatives. As a result, we cannot guarantee that we will achieve and/or sustain our profitability and financial performance objectives in the future, whether on our expected timelines, or at all. 

We may also be subject to additional unexpected costs, negative impacts on our cash flows from operating activities, employee attrition and adverse effects on employee morale and potential failure to meet operational and growth targets due to the loss of employees, any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated results from our operations or otherwise adversely affect our business. Additionally, as we are operating our business with fewer employees, we face additional risk that we might not be able to execute on our strategic plans and product roadmap, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 

As we continue to identify areas of cost savings and operating efficiencies, we may consider implementing further measures to help streamline operations and improve cost efficiencies, which could result in the contraction of our business and the continued implementation of significant cost cutting measures such as further downsizing and exiting certain operations, including product lines, domestically and/or abroad. Any resource realignment, or decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit or discontinue product lines or businesses, may result in loss of significant revenues and investments and/or the recording of charges, such as write-offs, further workforce reduction or restructuring costs, charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or capacity underutilization, exit of co-manufacturing or other arrangements including risk of commercial disputes and other termination and exit costs, lease exit or other related costs, contract termination charges, or claims from third parties. Underutilization or cessation of our manufacturing facilities could adversely affect our gross margin and other operating results and we may be required to terminate or make penalty payments under certain supply chain arrangements, close or idle facilities, write down our long-lived assets, or shorten the useful lives and accelerate depreciation of our assets, which would increase our expenses. In addition, our strategic initiatives may not be adequate to support the long-term operations of our business, particularly under adverse circumstances. Furthermore, we may not be successful in implementing these initiatives or realizing our anticipated savings and efficiencies, including as a result of factors beyond our control. For example, we may not be able to build out or occupy the rest of the Campus Headquarters and are considering subleasing, assigning or otherwise transferring the unoccupied space, or negotiating a partial lease termination but may be unable to enter into or negotiate such an agreement or partial termination, which could have an adverse effect on our operating and financial results. An agreement to partially terminate, sublease, assign or otherwise transfer the unoccupied part of the Campus Headquarters would be subject to certain risks and uncertainties. For example, the agreement may not be completed on terms advantageous to us because the rental rate we receive under the agreement may not fully cover the rental rate we pay under the Campus Lease for the same space or our subtenants may fail to make lease payments, which may result in impairment charges for right-of-use assets and prepaid lease costs and could have a negative impact on our financial 

condition and results of operations. In addition, a partial termination of the lease could result in a penalty payment to exit the lease and non-cash write-off of prepaid lease costs, the amounts of which could be material and which could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 

If we are unable to realize the anticipated savings and efficiencies of our cost-reduction initiatives and related strategic initiatives, our operating and financial results would be adversely affected and could differ materially from our expectations. 

If we fail to effectively optimize our manufacturing and production capacity, accurately forecast demand for our products or quickly respond to forecast changes, our business and operating results and our brand reputation could be harmed. 

If we do not have sufficient capacity to meet our customers&#8217; demands and to satisfy increased demand, or are not able to streamline and optimize manufacturing capacity for specific products, we will need to expand our operations, supply and manufacturing capabilities. However, there is risk in our ability to effectively scale production processes, optimize manufacturing capacity for specific products and effectively manage our supply chain requirements. We must accurately forecast demand for each of our products and inventory needs in order to ensure we have adequate available manufacturing capacity for each such product and to ensure we are effectively managing our inventory. Our forecasts are based on multiple assumptions which may cause our estimates to be inaccurate and affect our ability to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity (whether our own manufacturing capacity or co-manufacturing capacity) and adequate inventory supply in order to meet the demand for our products, which could prevent us from meeting increased customer demand and harm our brand and our business and in some cases may result in fines or indemnification obligations we must pay customers or distributors if we are unable to fulfill orders placed by them in a timely manner or at all. 

Consumer demand for plant-based meat products has continued to decline in the U.S. and has softened in certain international markets. For example, in 2024, our U.S. market and channels were negatively impacted by a continued decrease in demand in the category and for our products. If consumer demand for plant-based meats continues to decrease, or if any such decrease is further prolonged, demand for our products by our customers may also continue to decrease. Weakness in the category has had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and continued or worsening weakness would likely have a similar or greater effect, which would in turn make it difficult to accurately predict and forecast demand. 

Furthermore, if we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities and inventory supply with demand, if we experience disruptions or delays in our supply chain, or if we cannot obtain raw materials of sufficient quantity and quality at reasonable prices and in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. 

We may not be able to utilize our capacity efficiently or accurately plan our capacity requirements, which may adversely affect our gross margin, business and operating results. 

If we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity or inventory, as we have done in certain periods in the past, we may have significantly underutilized assets. Underutilization of our manufacturing and/or co-manufacturing facilities can adversely affect our gross margin and other operating results. If demand for our products experiences a prolonged decrease, we may be required to terminate or make penalty payments under certain supply chain arrangements, close or idle facilities, write down our long-lived assets, or shorten the useful lives and accelerate depreciation of our assets, which would increase our expenses. For example, in 2023 and 2022, lower than anticipated revenues negatively impacted our capacity utilization, which resulted in the Company incurring underutilization fees and termination fees that were required in order to exit certain supply chain arrangements. 

If demand does not materialize at the rate forecasted, we may not be able to scale back our manufacturing expenses or overhead costs quickly enough to correspond to the lower than expected demand. This could result in lower margins and adversely impact our business and results of operations. Additionally, if product demand continues to decrease or stays flat or we fail to forecast demand accurately, our results may be 

adversely impacted due to higher costs resulting from lower manufacturing utilization, causing higher fixed costs per unit produced. Further we may be required to recognize excess or obsolete inventory write-off charges, or excess capacity charges. We routinely monitor and recognize excess or obsolete inventory write-off charges when appropriate, which has negatively impacted our results of operations. For example, in 2023, we recorded incremental provision for excess and obsolete inventory in the amount of $38.0 million primarily arising from our Global Operations Review. 

If we are unable to sell our inventory in a timely manner, it could become obsolete, which could require us to write-down or write-off obsolete inventory, which could harm our operating results. 

There is a risk that we may be unable to sell our inventory in a timely manner to avoid it becoming obsolete. If we are required to substantially discount our inventory or are unable to sell our inventory in a timely manner, we would be required to increase our inventory provision or write-off obsolete inventory and our operating results could be substantially harmed. Alternatively, we may be required to mark down certain products to sell any excess inventory or to sell such inventory through liquidation channels at significantly lower prices, which would negatively impact our business and operating results. For example, in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, our net revenues were negatively impacted by strategic promotional discounts and our gross profit was negatively impacted by write-down of inventory, among other factors, which increased costs per pound. 

Our ability to accurately forecast our future results of operations is subject to many risks and uncertainties and our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations. 

Our ability to accurately forecast our future results of operations is limited by and dependent on a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in this report. Our historical revenue growth should not be considered indicative of our future performance. Our revenue growth has declined and could continue to decline or slow for a number of reasons, including but not limited to weak demand in the plant-based meat category and for our products, other macroeconomic factors such as high inflation, higher interest rates and potential recessionary concerns, reduced consumer confidence and changes in consumer preferences or spending and competitive activity from our market competitors and new market entrants. In fact, net revenues decreased to $326.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2024 from $343.4 million in the prior year, representing a 4.9% decrease. If we are unable to execute our cost-down initiatives, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market and demand for our products may continue to slow, either of which could continue to adversely affect our revenues and margins. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties and our future revenue generation are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations, and our business could suffer. 

From time to time, we may release earnings guidance, financial goals or other forward-looking statements in our earnings releases, earnings conference calls or otherwise regarding our future performance that represent our management&#8217;s estimates as of the date of the release. Some or all of the assumptions of any future guidance or financial goals that we furnish may not materialize or may vary significantly from actual future results. For example, our ability to make progress toward reducing operating expenses and achieving and/or sustaining our profitability and financial performance objectives is dependent on a number of assumptions and uncertainties, including, without limitation, demand in the plant-based meat category and for our products, which has continued to decline; our ability to both raise capital and reduce costs and achieve and/or sustain positive gross margin; our ability to grow revenues and meet operating expense reduction targets, which may be subject to factors beyond our control; timing of capital expenditures; and our ability to monetize inventory and manage working capital. The other risks described in this report may also cause our actual future results to differ. 

We estimate market opportunity and forecast market growth that may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all. 

Our estimates of market opportunity and growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may prove to be inaccurate. The factors that go into the calculation of our market opportunity are subject to change over time and may be variable or inaccurate and may be affected by increasing competition from our market competitors and new market entrants. Any expansion in our market depends on a number of factors, including the cost and perceived value associated with our products and those of our competitors. Even if the market in which we compete meets the size estimates and growth forecast, our business could fail to grow at the rate we anticipate, if at all. Our growth is subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties. 

Because we rely on a limited number of third party suppliers, we may not be able to obtain raw materials on a timely basis or in sufficient quantities at competitive prices to produce our products or meet the demand for our products. 

We rely on a limited number of vendors, a portion of whom are located internationally, to supply us with raw materials. In some instances, we purchase raw materials from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions. Our financial performance depends in large part on our ability to arrange for the purchase of raw materials in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. We have entered into a multi-year sales agreement for plant-based protein with one of our pea protein suppliers pursuant to which we are required to purchase specified minimum monthly and semi-annual quantities through the term. Aside from this agreement and a few select others, we are not assured of continued supply or pricing of raw materials. For example, we do not currently have a long-term supply agreement for avocado oil. Any of our other suppliers could discontinue or seek to alter their relationship with us. We have in the past experienced interruptions in the supply of pea protein from one supplier that resulted in delays in delivery to us. We could experience similar delays in the future from any of our suppliers. Any disruption in the supply of pea protein or other raw materials, such as avocado oil, may have a material adverse effect on our business if we do not have sufficient stocks on hand or if we cannot replace these suppliers in a timely manner, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. 

In addition, our pea protein suppliers manufacture their products at a limited number of facilities. A natural disaster, severe weather, fire, power interruption, work stoppage or other calamity affecting any of these facilities, or any interruption in their operations, could negatively impact our ability to obtain required quantities of pea protein in a timely manner, or at all, which could materially reduce our product sales and net revenues, and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 

The markets for some of the ingredients we use, such as avocado oil, may be particularly volatile due to factors such as limited supply sources, crop yield, seasonal shifts, climate conditions, industry demand, including as a result of food safety concerns, product recalls and government regulations. 

Events that adversely affect our suppliers of pea protein and other raw materials, such as avocado oil, could impair our ability to obtain raw material inventory in the quantities at competitive prices that we desire. Such events include problems with our suppliers&#8217; businesses, finances, labor relations and/or shortages, strikes or other labor unrest, ability to import raw materials, product quality issues, costs, production, insurance and reputation, as well as local economic and political conditions, restrictive U.S. and foreign governmental actions, such as restrictions on transfers of funds and trade protection measures, including export/import duties and quotas and customs duties and tariffs, adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in legal or regulatory requirements, border closures, disease outbreaks or pandemics (such as COVID-19), acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters, fires, earthquakes, flooding, severe weather, agricultural diseases or other catastrophic occurrences. For example, substantially all of our pea protein is sourced from Canada. In February 2025, the United States announced additional tariffs on imports from Canada. Any imposition or increase in tariffs on Canadian imports into the United States could potentially lead to increased costs and potential supply chain disruptions for this ingredient. We continuously seek alternative sources of protein to use in our products, but we may not be successful in diversifying the raw materials we use in our products. 

If we need to replace an existing supplier, there can be no assurance that supplies of raw materials will be available when required on acceptable terms, or at all, or that a new supplier would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements, fill our orders in a timely manner or meet our strict quality standards. 

In 2023, we began sourcing avocado oil. Avocado oil is a globally sourced ingredient, however, if we are unable to source avocado oil from preferred regions or suppliers, we may need to diversify our sourcing, which may result in adverse impacts on cost, quality or other aspects of our products or business. There are also increasing expectations that companies monitor and address aspects of the environmental, social and geographic provenance of their products, including inputs from their supply chain. 

If we are unable to manage our supply chain effectively and ensure that our products are available to meet consumer demand, we may not be able to fulfill customer orders, our operating costs could increase and our profit margins could decrease. 

Disruptions to our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results. 

Our ability to make, move and sell products in coordination with our suppliers, co-manufacturers and distributors is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our collective supply, manufacturing or distribution capabilities resulting from severe weather, fires or evacuations related thereto, natural disasters, including climate-related events, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other outbreaks of contagious diseases, agricultural diseases, cyber incidents, security breaches, system failures, terrorism, governmental restrictions or mandates, political instability, trade restrictions, import restrictions, border closures, freight carrier availability, labor shortages, strikes or other labor unrest, the financial or operational instability of key suppliers and carriers, disruptions, repairs or enhancements at facilities manufacturing or delivering our products or other reasons have, in the past, impaired and could, in the future, impair our ability to source inputs or manufacture, sell or timely deliver our products. To the extent we are unable to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, there could be a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results. 

Additionally, there are increasing expectations in various jurisdictions that companies monitor the environmental and social performance of their suppliers, including compliance with a variety of labor practices, as well as consider a wider range of potential environmental and social matters, including the end of life considerations for products. Compliance can be costly, require us to establish or augment programs to diligence or monitor our suppliers, or, in the case of legislation such as the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, to design supply chains to avoid certain suppliers or regions altogether. Failure to comply with such regulations can result in fines, reputational damage, import ineligibility for certain products or raw materials, or otherwise adversely impact our business. 

Inflationary price pressures of raw materials, labor, transportation, fuel or other inputs used by us and our suppliers, including the effects of higher interest rates, has negatively impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, our business and results of operations. 

Our operating environment has been impacted by inflation and higher interest rates. Increases in the price of raw materials, labor, wages, energy or other inputs that we or our suppliers use in manufacturing and supplying products, along with logistics, transportation, shipping, fuel and other related costs, has led to higher production and shipping costs for our products. Increases in the cost of inputs to our production has led to higher costs for our products in our foodservice and retail channels and has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our operating results and future profitability. General inflation, including rising energy prices, interest rates and wages, currency volatility and monetary, fiscal and policy interventions by national or regional governments in reaction to such events could continue to have negative impacts on our business by increasing our operating costs and our borrowing costs as well as decreasing the capital available for our customers to purchase our products. Increased borrowing costs faced by our customers could result in decreased demand for our products. The impact of inflation could also continue to reduce consumer confidence and decrease consumer discretionary spending, including spending to purchase our products, and negatively affect trends in consumer purchasing patterns due to changes in consumers&#8217; disposable income, credit 

availability and debt levels. The impact of high inflation and the plant-based meat sector&#8217;s premium pricing relative to animal protein have caused and could continue to cause consumers to trade down into cheaper forms of protein, including animal meat, beans and other non-animal meat protein sources. 

Our future business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by reduced or limited availability of plant-based protein or avocado oil that meets our standards. 

Our ability to ensure a continuing supply of ingredients at competitive prices depends on many factors beyond our control, such as the number and size of farms that grow certain crops such as European and North American yellow peas, other plant-based proteins and avocados, the vagaries of these farming businesses (including poor harvests impacting the quality of the peas grown), changes in national and world economic conditions, including as a result of COVID-19 or the outbreak of hostilities or war, tariffs and our ability to forecast our ingredient requirements. The high-quality ingredients used in many of our products are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as floods, droughts, frosts, earthquakes, hurricanes and pestilence. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters can lower crop yields and reduce crop size and quality, which in turn could reduce the available supply of, or increase the price of, quality ingredients. In addition, we purchase some ingredients and other materials offshore, and the price and availability of such ingredients and materials may be affected by political events or other conditions in these countries or tariffs, trade wars or the outbreak of hostilities or war. We also compete with other food producers in the procurement of ingredients, and this competition may increase in the future if consumer demand for plant-based meat products increases. If supplies of quality ingredients are reduced or there is greater demand for such ingredients from us and others, we may not be able to obtain sufficient supply that meets our strict quality standards on favorable terms, or at all, which could impact our ability to supply products and may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

We rely on a limited number of distributors, and if we experience the loss of one or more distributors and cannot replace them in a timely manner, our results of operations may be adversely affected. 

Many retailers and foodservice providers purchase our products through distributors who purchase, store, sell, and deliver our products to retailers and foodservice providers. In each of 2024, 2023 and 2022, DOT accounted for approximately 12% of our gross revenues. Since these distributors act as intermediaries between us and the retailers and foodservice providers, we do not have short-term or long-term commitments or minimum purchase volumes in our contracts with them that ensure future sales of our products. If we lose one or more of our distributors and cannot replace the distributor in a timely manner or at all, our business, results of operation and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. 

If we fail to cost-effectively acquire new customers or retain our existing customers, or if we fail to derive revenue from our existing customers consistent with our historical performance, our business could be materially adversely affected. 

Our success, and our ability to increase revenues and operate profitably, depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively acquire new customers, to retain existing customers, and to keep existing customers engaged so that they continue to purchase products from us. We intend to continue efforts to expand our number of retail and foodservice customers, both in the United States and internationally, as part of our long-term growth strategy. This may require us to provide marketing and other financial incentives to our customers to assist in the promotion of our products. Such additional incentives could have a negative impact on gross margin and may not necessarily result in increased sales. In addition, foodservice customers will often initially add certain of our product offerings to their menus at limited locations and/or on a limited test basis, after which time these customers may choose to no longer offer our products or may ultimately scale back subsequent expansions. If we fail to attract and retain new customers, or retain our existing customers&#8212;some of whom we do not have written contracts with&#8212;our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, timing of retail shelf resets are not within our control, and to the extent retail customers change the timing of such events, reduce our in store-displays, are out of stock of our products or are not able to restock our products effectively, sales of our products may be impaired and negatively impact our revenues. 

Further, if customers do not perceive our product offerings to be of sufficient value and quality, or if we fail to offer new and relevant product offerings at a competitive price, we may not be able to attract or retain customers or engage existing customers so that they continue to purchase products from us. We may lose customers to our competitors if they offer superior products to ours, if we are unable to compete on the basis of value and taste, if we are unable to meet customers&#8217; orders in a timely manner, or if we are unable to identify and execute cost-down initiatives intended to achieve more competitive pricing over time. The loss of any large customer or the reduction of purchasing levels or the cancellation of business from such customers could have a material adverse impact on our business. 

Consolidation of customers or the loss of a significant customer could negatively impact our sales and profitability. 

Supermarkets in North America and the European Union have generally consolidated over time. This consolidation has produced larger, more sophisticated organizations with increased negotiating and buying power that are able to resist price increases, as well as operate with lower inventories, decrease the number of brands that they carry and increase their emphasis on private label products, all of which could negatively impact our business. The consolidation of retail customers also increases the risk that a significant adverse impact on their business could have a corresponding material adverse impact on our business. The loss of any large customer, the reduction of purchasing levels or the cancellation of any business from a large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profitability. 

Furthermore, as retailers consolidate, they may reduce the number of branded products they offer in order to accommodate private label products and generate more competitive terms from branded suppliers competing for limited retailer shelf space. A retailer may take actions that affect us for reasons that we cannot always anticipate or control, such as their financial condition, changes in their business strategy or operations, the introduction of competing products, pricing and promotions, shelf reset timing and activity, reduced in store-displays, timing of product restocking or the perceived quality of our products. Despite operating in different channels, our retailers sometimes compete for the same consumers as our foodservice channel. Because of actual or perceived conflicts resulting from this competition, retailers may take actions that negatively affect us. 

Loss of one or more of our co-manufacturers or our failure to timely identify and establish relationships with new co-manufacturers could harm our business and impede our growth. 

A significant amount of our revenue is derived from products manufactured at manufacturing facilities owned and operated by our co-manufacturers, a portion of which are located internationally. Any of the co-manufacturers with whom we do not have a written contract could seek to alter or terminate its relationship with us at any time, leaving us with periods during which we have limited or no ability to manufacture our products. If we need to replace a co-manufacturer, there can be no assurance that additional capacity will be available when required on acceptable terms, or at all. 

If any of our co-manufacturers fail to comply with food safety, environmental, health and safety or other laws and regulations, or face allegations of non-compliance, their operations may be disrupted and our business and reputation could be harmed. An interruption in, or the loss of operations at, one or more of our co-manufacturing facilities, which may be caused by work stoppages, labor shortages, strikes or other labor unrest, production disruptions, product quality or safety issues, local economic and political conditions, restrictive governmental actions, border closures, disease outbreaks or pandemics (such as COVID-19), the outbreak of hostilities, acts of war, terrorism, fire, earthquakes, severe weather, flooding or other natural disasters at one or more of these facilities, could delay, postpone or reduce production of some of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition until such time as such interruption is resolved or an alternate source of production is secured. 

We believe there are a limited number of competent, high-quality co-manufacturers in the industry that meet our strict quality and control standards, and as we seek to continue to obtain additional or alternative co-manufacturing arrangements in the future, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so on satisfactory terms, in a timely manner, or at all. The loss of one or more co-manufacturers, any disruption or 

delay at a co-manufacturer or any failure to identify and engage co-manufacturers for new products, product extensions and expanded operations, including internationally, could delay, postpone or reduce production of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Any damage or disruption at our domestic or international manufacturing facilities may harm our business. 

We have internal manufacturing facilities in the United States, China and the Netherlands to produce our woven proteins and our finished goods. A natural disaster, severe weather, fire, power interruption, work stoppage, labor shortages, strikes or other labor unrest, border closures, restrictive governmental actions, outbreaks of pandemics or contagious diseases (such as COVID-19) or other calamity at any of these facilities would significantly disrupt our ability to deliver our products and operate our business. If any material amount of our machinery or inventory were damaged, we would be unable to meet our contractual obligations and cannot predict when, if at all, we could replace or repair such machinery, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. 

Our business could be adversely affected by a workplace accident or safety incident. 

Our manufacturing processes and related activities could expose us to significant personal injury claims that could subject us to substantial liability. Specifically, our inability to anticipate or preempt potential workplace hazards, create safe working environments or timely adapt to changing requirements around maintaining a safe workplace could result in employee illness, accidents or other safety incidents. A failure to properly train our employees regarding, or respond appropriately and in a timely manner to, any such illness, accident or safety incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and reputation. While we maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice, the amount of such coverage may not be adequate to cover fully all claims, and we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident or safety incident resulting from our manufacturing activities. 

We may not successfully ramp up operations at our internal manufacturing facilities or these facilities may not operate in accordance with our expectations. Moreover, we face competition for employees and may be unable to hire and retain employees at these facilities. 

Since June 2018, we have acquired internal manufacturing facilities by purchase or lease in the United States, China and the Netherlands. Any substantial delay in bringing these facilities up to full production on our current schedule may hinder our ability to produce all of the product needed to meet orders and/or achieve our expected financial performance. Opening, maintaining and operating these facilities has required, and will continue to require, additional capital expenditures and the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel, which has and will continue to divert resources from our existing business or operations. These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenues and margins sufficiently to offset the anticipated higher expenses. Additionally, our inability to hire and retain skilled employees at these facilities will severely hamper our expansion plans, product development and manufacturing efforts. The unemployment rate in the Columbia, Missouri market and the Devault, Pennsylvania market were both 2.4% as of December 2024 and labor market conditions remain relatively tight. As a result, we currently rely on temporary workers in addition to full-time employees, and in the future, we may be unable to attract and retain employees with the skills we require, which could impact our ability to expand our operations. Even if our facilities are brought up to full production according to our current schedule, it may not provide us with all of the operational and financial benefits we expect to receive. 

Our facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products is costly to replace or repair and may require substantial lead-time to do so. For example, our estimate of throughput or our extrusion capacity may be impacted by disruption from extruder lead-in time, calibration, maintenance and unexpected delays. In addition, our ability to procure new extruders may face more lengthy lead times than is typical. We may also not be able to find suitable alternatives with co-manufacturers to replace the output from such equipment on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost. In the future, we may also experience plant shutdowns or 

periods of reduced production because of regulatory issues, equipment failure, delays in raw material deliveries, food safety incidents or other adverse events. Any such disruption or unanticipated event may cause significant interruptions or delays in our business and the reduction or loss of inventory may render us unable to fulfill customer orders in a timely manner, or at all. As part of our cost-reduction initiatives and our goal of reducing operating expenses, we intend to leverage our existing production infrastructure to meet demand for our products. As a result, if any of our production lines is disrupted, the foregoing risks are likely to be exacerbated. We have property and business disruption insurance in place for all of our internal manufacturing facilities; however, such insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. 

We may face difficulties as we expand our operations in other countries, including into those in which we have no prior operating experience. 

We intend to continue to expand our geographic presence and enter into new markets as part of our long-term growth strategy. To the extent that such geographic expansion eventually requires the establishment of new manufacturing operations in the respective local regions, we could face various challenges. International operations involve a number of risks, including labor shortages, strikes or other labor unrest, border closures, restrictive governmental actions, foreign regulatory compliance, tariffs, taxes and exchange controls, economic downturns, inflation, foreign currency fluctuations, uncertainty in financial markets and banking systems, and political and social instability in the countries in which we operate. Expansion may involve expanding into countries other than those in which we currently operate. It may also involve expanding into less developed countries, which may have less political, social or economic stability and less developed infrastructure and legal systems. In addition, it may be difficult for us to understand and accurately predict taste preferences and purchasing habits of consumers in these new geographic markets. It is costly to establish, develop and maintain international operations and develop and promote our brands in international markets. As we expand our business into other countries, we may encounter regulatory, legal, personnel, technological and other difficulties that increase our expenses and/or delay our ability to become profitable in such countries, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and brand. 

Our revenue growth rate has fluctuated in recent periods and may continue to slow or decline in the future. 

Since 2022, our revenue growth and revenues have slowed or declined, with periods of negative growth, and may continue to slow or decline further in future periods due to a number of potential factors, including without limitation, macroeconomic issues including inflation and higher interest rates, recessionary concerns, and potential impacts on consumer and customer behavior, and demand levels, increasing competition, market saturation, slowing demand for our offerings, prolonged weakness in the plant-based meat category, increasing regulatory costs and challenges and failure to capitalize on growth opportunities. 

Our revenues and earnings may fluctuate as a result of our promotional activities. 

We routinely offer sales discounts and promotions through various programs to customers and consumers which may result in reduced margins. These programs include rebates, temporary on-shelf price reductions, off- invoice discounts, retailer advertisements, product coupons and other trade activities. In addition, we have made changes in our pricing architecture including price increases of certain of our products in our U.S. retail and foodservice channels, and may in the future make changes, which may have a negative impact on our net revenues, gross profit, gross margin and profitability, impacting period-over-period results. We continue to face increasing competition across all channels, and expect that trend to continue, especially as additional plant-based meat product brands continue to enter the marketplace and if consumers continue to trade down among proteins in the context of significant inflationary pressure. Moving forward we expect to continue to invest in promotional discounting to address the current consumer trend with more targeted key selling period activations that we expect will allow us to scale back overall trade spending and continue to build brand awareness and increase consumer trials of our products. Although these actions are intended to build brand awareness and increase consumer trials of our products, they have had and are likely to continue to have a negative impact on our net revenues, gross profit, gross margin and profitability, impacting period-over-period results. 

Fluctuations in our results of operations for our second and third quarters may impact, and may have a disproportionate effect on our overall financial condition and results of operations. 

Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations that may have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations. Generally, we expect to experience greater demand for certain of our products during the U.S. summer grilling season. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, U.S. retail channel net revenues during the second quarter were 21%, 10% and 16% higher than the first quarter, respectively. While we expected to continue to see additional seasonality effects in 2024, as compared to 2023, we saw more muted effects from seasonality in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior-year periods and the second quarter of 2024, reflecting, in part, pricing actions in our U.S. retail and foodservice channels. In general, any historical effects of seasonality have been more pronounced within our U.S. retail channel, with revenue contribution from this channel generally tending to be greater in the second and third quarters of the year, driven by increased levels of grilling activity, higher levels of purchasing by customers ahead of holidays, the impact of customer shelf reset activity and the timing of product restocking by our retail customers. Any factors that harm our second and third quarter operating results, including disruptions in our supply chain, adverse weather or unfavorable economic conditions, may have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire year. In an environment of heightened uncertainty from potential recessionary and inflationary pressures, prolonged weakness in the plant-based meat category, competition and other factors impacting our business, we are unable to assess the ultimate impact on the demand for our products as a result of seasonality. 

Historical results are not indicative of future results. 

Historical quarter-to-quarter and period-over-period comparisons of our sales and operating results are not necessarily indicative of future quarter-to-quarter and period-over-period results. You should not rely on the results of a single quarter or period as an indication of our annual results or our future performance. 

Failure by our transportation providers to deliver our products on time, or at all, could result in lost sales. 

We currently rely upon third party transportation providers for a significant portion of our product shipments. Our utilization of delivery services for shipments is subject to risks, including increases in fuel prices, which would increase our shipping costs, employee strikes, disease outbreaks or pandemics (such as COVID-19) and inclement weather, which may impact the ability of providers to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs, if at all. We periodically change shipping companies, and we could face logistical difficulties that could adversely affect deliveries. In addition, we could incur costs and expend resources in connection with such change. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those we receive from the third party transportation providers that we currently use, which in turn would increase our costs and thereby adversely affect our operating results. 

We have undergone, and may continue to experience, changes to our executive leadership team and senior management, and if we are unable to integrate new members of our executive leadership team or senior management, or if we fail to retain members of our executive leadership team and senior management, our business and operations may be adversely affected. 

Our success is substantially dependent on the continued service of certain members of our senior management, including Ethan Brown, our Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer. These executives have been primarily responsible for determining the strategic direction of our business and for executing our growth strategy and are integral to our brand, culture and the reputation we enjoy with suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors, customers and consumers. The loss of the services of any of these executives could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects, as we may not be able to find suitable individuals to replace them on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, any such departure could be viewed in a negative light by investors and analysts, which may cause the price of our common stock to decline. We do not currently carry key-person life insurance for our senior executives. 

From time to time, there may be changes in our executive leadership team and senior management as a result of the hiring, departure or realignment of key personnel, and such changes may impact our business. Over the last few years, we have had several changes to our executive leadership team and senior management, including as a result of organizational changes based on cost-reduction initiatives. Any significant leadership change or senior management transition involves inherent risk and any failure to ensure the timely and suitable replacement and a smooth transition could hinder our strategic planning, business execution and future performance. In particular, these or any future leadership transitions may result in a loss of personnel with deep institutional or technical knowledge and changes in business strategy or objectives and have the potential to disrupt our operations and relationships with employees and customers due to added costs, operational inefficiencies, changes in strategy, decreased employee morale and productivity, and increased turnover. If we are unable to successfully integrate new executive leadership team members and senior management, our operations may be adversely affected and we may not be able to achieve our operating objectives. 

If we are unable to attract, train and retain employees or maintain our company culture, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business. 

Our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of employees who understand and appreciate our culture and can represent our brand effectively and establish credibility with our business partners, customers and consumers. We believe a critical component of our success has been our company culture and long-standing core values. We have invested substantial time and resources in building our team. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of meeting our business needs and expectations, or if we fail to preserve our company culture among a larger number of employees dispersed in various geographic regions, our business and brand image may be impaired. Any failure to meet our staffing needs or any material increase in turnover rates of our employees or key personnel changes may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

In 2023, we reduced our workforce by approximately 65 employees, representing approximately 19% of our global non-production workforce (or approximately 8% of our total global workforce). On February 24, 2025, our board of directors approved a plan to reduce our workforce in North America and the EU by approximately 44 employees, representing approximately 17% of our global non-production workforce (or approximately 6% of our total global workforce). In addition, as part of our Global Operations Review, on February 24, 2025, our board of directors approved a plan to suspend our current operational activities in China, which are estimated to cease by the end of the second quarter of 2025. As part of this plan, we are reducing our workforce in China by approximately 20 employees, representing approximately 95% of our China workforce (or approximately 3% of our total global workforce). Any similar reductions in force may adversely affect employee morale, our culture and our ability to attract and retain critical employees. They may also negatively impact our ability to pursue new initiatives due to insufficient resources and personnel. We may be unsuccessful in distributing duties and obligations of impacted employees among the remaining employees. We also may not realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of any reductions in force and may suffer unintended consequences, such as the loss of institutional knowledge, higher than expected employee turnover and significant disruptions in our day-to-day operations. If we are unable to realize the expected operational efficiencies or cost savings from the reductions in force, or if we experience significant adverse consequences as a result, our business, financial conditions and results of operations may be adversely affected. See Note 15 , Subsequent Events, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. 

Some of our international employees are employed by professional employer organizations. 

Our human resources, payroll and employee benefits functions are not performed by a professional employer organization (&#8220;PEO&#8221;) for employees in the United States, although we contract with non-U.S. PEOs to perform the same functions for the majority of our employees outside the United States. Although we recruit and select our workers, each of these workers is also an employee of record of the relevant non-U.S. PEO. As a result, these workers are compensated through the relevant PEO, are governed by the work policies created by the relevant PEO and receive their annual wage statements and other payroll or labor related reports from the relevant PEO (e.g., T-4s for employees in Canada). This relationship permits management to focus on 

operations and profitability rather than payroll administration, but this relationship also exposes us to some risks. Among other risks, if any of the non-U.S. PEOs fail to adequately withhold or pay employer taxes or to comply with applicable laws, we may be held liable for such violations notwithstanding any indemnification provisions with the non-U.S. PEOs. In certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, the worker may be deemed a direct employee and the potential liability for any non-compliance with applicable laws increases depending on whether a company has an entity or other corporate presence in the country, among other factors set forth under applicable local laws. 

Court and administrative proceedings related to matters of employment tax, labor law and other laws applicable to PEO arrangements could distract management from our business and cause us to incur significant expense. If we were held liable for violations by PEOs, such amounts may adversely affect our profitability and could negatively affect our business and results of operations. 

An interruption in services provided by third party service providers could adversely affect our business operations. 

We depend on a limited number of third party service providers for the performance of several of our business operations, including payroll and human capital management services. If any of these third party providers were to experience significant interruptions in their business operations, terminate their agreements with the Company, or fail to perform the services required under the terms of our contracts with them, our business operations could be materially and adversely affected for an indefinite period of time. There can be no assurance that we would be able to locate alternative providers of such services, or that we could do so at economical rates. 

Future acquisitions or investments could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition. 

In the future, we may pursue acquisitions or investments that we believe will help us achieve our strategic objectives. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and even if we do, we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately achieve our goals or realize the anticipated benefits. The pursuit of acquisitions and any integration process will require significant time and resources and could divert management time and focus from operation of our then-existing business, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully. Any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our customers or consumers. An acquisition, investment or business relationship may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including disrupting our ongoing operations and subjecting us to additional liabilities, increasing our expenses, and adversely impacting our business, financial condition and operating results. Moreover, we may be exposed to unknown liabilities related to the acquired company or product, and the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment or business relationship may not be realized if, for example, we fail to successfully integrate such acquisition into our company. To pay for any such acquisitions, we would have to use cash, incur debt, or issue debt or equity securities, each of which may affect our financial condition or the value of our common stock and could result in dilution to our stockholders. If we incur more debt it would result in increased fixed obligations and could also subject us to covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. Our acquisition strategy could require significant management attention, disrupt our business and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Our business and reputation could be negatively impacted by ESG matters and/or our reporting of such matters. 

There is an increased focus from lawmakers, regulators, investors, customers, employees and other stakeholders on corporate ESG practices, including climate change and human capital, and related ESG disclosure requirements. Expectations regarding ESG initiatives and disclosures may result in increased costs (including but not limited to increased costs related to compliance, stakeholder engagement, contracting and insurance), changes in demand for certain products, enhanced compliance or disclosure obligations, or other adverse impacts to our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, standards for tracking and reporting ESG matters continue to evolve, and our business may be impacted by new laws, regulations or 

investor criteria in the U.S., Europe and around the world related to ESG. These legal and regulatory requirements, as well as investor expectations related to ESG practices and disclosures are subject to change, can be unpredictable, and may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with. 

While we may at times engage in voluntary initiatives (such as voluntary disclosures, certifications or goals, among others) to improve the ESG profile of our company and/or products, such initiatives may be costly and may not have the desired effect. Expectations around the Company&#8217;s management of ESG matters continues to evolve rapidly, in many instances due to factors that are out of our control. For example, we may not ultimately be able to complete certain goals or initiatives, either on the timelines originally anticipated or at all, due to technical, cost or other factors, which may be in or out of our control. Many ESG initiatives leverage methodologies, standards and data that are complex and continue to evolve. As with other companies, our approach to such matters also evolves, and we cannot guarantee that our approach will align with the expectations or preferences of any particular stakeholder. Moreover, various stakeholders (as well as third party ratings or benchmarks that they may use) have different, and at times conflicting, expectations, which increases the risk that any action may be deemed insufficient or inappropriate by some stakeholders. Any failure to successfully navigate such expectations may result in reputational harm, loss of customers or employees, regulatory or investor engagement, or other adverse impacts on our business. We may be especially subject to scrutiny on such matters given efforts to portray our operations and products as a more sustainable and conscientious alternative to certain competitor products. 

Increasing governmental and societal attention to ESG matters, including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence and disclosure on topics such as climate change, human capital, labor and risk oversight, could also expand the nature, scope and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess and report. For example, to the extent ESG matters negatively impact our reputation, it may also impede our ability to compete as effectively to attract and retain employees, customers, or business partners, which may adversely impact our operations. As another example, various policymakers, including the State of California and the European Union, among others, have adopted (or are considering adopting) requirements for companies to undertake various actions, including disclosures, on climate- or other ESG-related matters. These requirements are not uniform and may not be interpreted or applied uniformly, which may increase the cost and complexity of compliance and any associated risks. Moreover, some policymakers have sought to constrain companies&#8217; consideration of various ESG matters. Such regulatory scrutiny on ESG matters, along with other stakeholder expectations, may enhance any of the risks discussed in this risk factor. If we do not successfully manage and address stakeholder expectations and standards in connection with our ESG initiatives, including any changes in legal requirements or interpretations thereof, our business and reputation could be negatively impacted and our share price and access to/cost of capital could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, many of our customers and suppliers may be subject to similar expectations, which may augment or create additional risks, including risks that may not be known to us. 

The Company is subject to accounting estimate risks. 

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. Estimates are made at specific points in time and based on facts, historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at such time. For example, during the first quarter of 2023, we completed a reassessment of the useful lives of our large manufacturing and research and development equipment, and determined that we should increase the estimated useful lives from a range 5 to 10 years to a uniform 10 years. The timing of this reassessment was based on a combination of factors accumulating over time, including historical useful life information and changes in our planned use of the equipment that provided us with updated information that allowed us to make a better estimate of the economic lives of such equipment. 

This was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate and was made on a prospective basis effective January 1, 2023. If actual results differ from our judgments and assumptions, then it may have a material, adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows. This change in accounting estimate decreased 

depreciation expense for 2023 by $21.0 million, impacting cost of goods sold and research and development expenses by $19.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively, and decreased both basic and diluted net loss per share available to common stockholders for 2023 by $0.33. 

Any changes in estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP or any future impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and operating results. 

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP involves making estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets (including intangible assets), liabilities, revenues and expenses. This includes estimates, judgments and assumptions for assessing the recoverability of our assets, pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board issued authoritative guidance. If any estimates, judgments or assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record additional expenses and/or impairment charges. See &#8220;&#8212; The Company is subject to accounting estimate risks .&#8221; 

We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under assumptions or conditions that may change in the future. While we believe the assumptions and estimates we make are reasonable, any changes to our assumptions or estimates, or any actual results which differ from our assumptions or estimates, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results. Improper design and implementation of internal controls related to the estimates could result in misstatement of financial reports. 

We perform an asset impairment analysis on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a long-lived asset group may not be recoverable. Failure to achieve forecasted operating results, due to weakness in the economic environment or other factors, changes in market conditions and declines in our market capitalization, the planned suspension of our operational activities in China, and failure to negotiate a partial lease termination or sublease, assign or otherwise transfer the unoccupied space of our Campus Headquarters, among other things, could result in impairment of our assets and adversely affect our operating results. 

Our results of operations could be materially negatively affected if we cannot successfully keep pace with technological changes impacting the development of our products and implementation of our business needs. 

Our success depends on our ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes affecting the development of our products and implementation of our business needs. Emerging technological trends such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and automation are impacting industries and business operations. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments, appropriately implement new technologies or evolve our business at sufficient speed and scale in response to such developments, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments, our products, results of operations and ability to develop and maintain our business could be negatively affected. Our competitors or other third parties may incorporate such technologies into their products and business more quickly or more successfully than us, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our results of operations. 

Risks Related to Our Products 

Food safety and food-borne illness incidents, or the perception of related risks, may materially adversely affect our business by exposing us to lawsuits, product recalls or regulatory enforcement actions, increasing our operating costs and reducing demand for our product offerings. 

Selling food for human consumption involves inherent legal and other risks, and there is increasing governmental scrutiny of and public awareness regarding food safety. Unexpected side effects, illness, injury or death related to allergens, food-borne illnesses or other food safety incidents caused by products we sell, or involving our suppliers or co-manufacturers, could result in the discontinuance of sales of these products or our relationships with such suppliers or co-manufacturers, or otherwise result in destruction and write-off of raw materials or product inventory, delayed or lost sales, increased operating costs, regulatory enforcement actions or harm to our reputation. Shipment of adulterated or misbranded products, even if inadvertent, can result in criminal or civil liability. Such incidents could also expose us to product liability, negligence or other lawsuits, including consumer class action lawsuits. Any claims brought against us may exceed or be outside the scope of our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits. Any judgment against us that is more than our policy limits or not covered by our policies or not subject to insurance would have to be paid from our cash reserves, which would reduce our capital resources. Similarly, the perception of risks related to such incidents, whether actual or not, or related to such claims, whether meritorious or not, could have an adverse effect on our brand and reputation. 

The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or other food safety incidents could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs, disruptions in supply and a reduction in our sales. Furthermore, any instances of food contamination or regulatory noncompliance, whether or not caused by our actions, could compel us, our suppliers, our distributors or our customers, depending on the circumstances, to conduct a recall in accordance with FDA regulations, comparable state laws or foreign laws such as those of the European Union, the United Kingdom and China. Food recalls and other food illness and food safety incidents could result in significant losses due to their costs, the destruction of raw materials or product inventory, lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time and potential loss of existing distributors or customers and a potential negative impact on our ability to attract new customers due to negative consumer experiences or because of an adverse impact on our brand and reputation. The costs of a recall could exceed or be outside the scope of our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits. 

In addition, food companies have been subject to targeted, large-scale tampering as well as to opportunistic, individual product tampering, and we, like any food company, could be a target for product tampering. Forms of tampering could include the introduction of foreign material, chemical contaminants and pathological organisms into consumer products as well as product substitution. FDA regulations require companies like us to analyze, prepare and implement mitigation strategies specifically to address tampering (i.e., intentional adulteration) designed to inflict widespread public health harm. If we do not adequately address the possibility, or any actual instance, of intentional adulteration, we could face possible seizure or recall of our products and the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. 

Consumer preferences for our products are difficult to predict and may change, and, if we are unable to respond quickly to new trends and demands, our business may be adversely affected. 

Our business is focused on the development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of a line of branded plant-based meat products as alternatives to animal-based protein products. Consumer demand has in the past changed and could change again in the future based on a number of possible factors, including dietary habits and nutritional values, concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients and shifts in preference for various product attributes. Decreased consumer demand for our products has caused our business and financial condition to suffer, and any further decrease in, or flattening of, such demand would likely have a similar effect. In addition, sales of plant-based meat or meat-alternative products are subject to evolving consumer preferences that we may not be able to accurately predict or respond to. Consumer trends that we believe favor sales of our products could change based on a number of possible factors, including a shift in preference from 

plant-based meat to animal-based protein products (including any products produced using new farming methods or technologies which may reduce the adverse environmental and other factors associated with conventional animal-based protein products), increased acceptance for different alternative proteins that are used in our products, economic factors and social trends. A significant shift in consumer demand away from our products or the plant-based meat category in general, could reduce our sales or our market share and the prestige of our brand, which would harm our business and financial condition. In addition, if the Beyond IV platform is not widely accepted, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected. 

Additionally, lobbyists supporting the meat industry have engaged in marketing campaigns in an attempt to generate negative publicity regarding our products and may continue to do so in the future. Any shift in consumer perception that our products are not healthy as a result of these campaigns could significantly reduce the value of our brand and damage our business. Other types of adverse publicity concerning our business or the plant-based meat industry generally could also harm our brand, reputation and results of operations. The growing use of social and digital media over recent years has amplified the impact of such negative publicity. 

Sales of the Beyond Burger contribute a significant portion of our revenue. A reduction in sales of Beyond Burger would have an adverse effect on our financial condition. 

Beyond Burger accounted for approximately 52%, 51% and 50% of our gross revenues in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Beyond Burger is our flagship product and has historically been the focal point of our development and marketing efforts, and we believe that sales of the Beyond Burger will continue to constitute a significant portion of our revenues, income and cash flow for the foreseeable future. We announced the fourth generation of our core beef platform, Beyond IV, and rolled out the new Beyond Burger and Beyond Beef in 2024. We cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to expand production and distribution of the Beyond Burger, or that customer demand for our other existing and future products, including the Beyond IV platform, will expand to allow such products to represent a larger percentage of our revenue than they do currently. Accordingly, any factor adversely affecting sales of the Beyond Burger could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We have in the past, and may in the future, increase the prices of our products; however, consumers may not be willing to pay increased prices for our products or, if we cannot maintain such prices in accordance with our business strategy, our margins may stagnate or decrease. 

As part of our efforts to expand our gross margin, we have in the past, and may also in the future, increase the prices of certain or all of our products in order to offset cost increases or improve the profitability of our business. Our ability to maintain prices or effectively implement price increases may be affected by several factors, including competition&#8212;from both conventional animal-protein companies and other plant-based meat brands, the effectiveness of our marketing programs, the continuing strength of our brand, market demand for our products or in the plant-based meat category generally and general economic conditions, including broader inflationary pressures. Consumers may be less willing or able to pay a price premium for our products, during challenging economic times or at all, and may choose to purchase lower-priced or other value offerings, making it more difficult for us to maintain prices or effectively implement price increases. In addition, our retail partners and distributors may pressure us to rescind price increases we have announced or already implemented, whether through a change in list price or increased trade and promotional activity. If we cannot maintain or increase prices for our products in accordance with our business strategy, our margins may be adversely affected. Furthermore, price increases generally cause volume losses, as consumers tend to purchase fewer units at higher price points. If such losses are greater than expected, or if we lose distribution due to price increases, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 

Failure to continually innovate and successfully introduce and commercialize new products or successfully improve existing products may adversely affect our ability to continue to grow. 

A key element of our long-term growth strategy depends on our ability to develop and market new products and improvements to our existing products that meet our standards for quality and appeal to consumer 

preferences. For example, in 2024, we announced our fourth generation of our core beef platform, Beyond IV and rolled out the Beyond Burger IV and Beyond Beef IV, followed by the Beyond Sausage IV generation of products, the Beyond Sun Sausage line and Beyond Bakes. In February 2025, we announced an expanded line of Beyond Steak. The success of our innovation and product development efforts, including the Beyond IV platform and the Beyond Sun Sausage and Beyond Steak lines, is affected by our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences, accurately predict taste preferences and purchasing habits of consumers in new geographic markets, the technical capability of our innovation staff in developing and testing product prototypes, including complying with applicable governmental regulations, commercialization and scale-up of new products, the success of our management and sales and marketing teams in introducing and marketing new products, and our ability to adapt to changes in technology, including the successful utilization of data analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Our innovation staff members are continuously testing alternative plant-based proteins to the proteins we currently use in our products, as they seek to find additional protein options to our current ingredients that are more easily sourced, and which retain and build upon the quality and appeal of our current product offerings. Failure to develop, commercialize and market new products that appeal to consumers may lead to a decrease in our growth, sales and profitability. 

Additionally, the development and introduction of new products, such as the Beyond IV platform and Beyond Sun Sausage and Beyond Steak lines, requires substantial research, development and marketing expenditures, which we may be unable to recoup if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance. If we are unsuccessful in meeting our objectives with respect to new or improved products, our business could be harmed. 

Ingredient and packaging costs are volatile and may rise significantly, which may negatively impact the profitability of our business. 

We purchase large quantities of raw materials, including ingredients derived from European and North American yellow peas, sunflower seeds, rice, faba beans, avocado oil, canola oil and coconut oil. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of cardboard, film and plastic to package our products. Costs of ingredients and packaging are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including increased tariffs, global competition for resources, weather conditions, consumer demand and changes in governmental trade and agricultural programs. Volatility in the prices of raw materials and other supplies we purchase could increase our cost of sales and reduce our profitability. Moreover, we may not be able to implement price increases for our products to cover any increased costs, and any price increases we do implement may result in lower sales volumes. If we are not successful in managing our ingredient and packaging costs, if we are unable to increase our prices to cover increased costs or if such price increases reduce our sales volumes, then such increases in costs will adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Risks Related to Our Industry and Brand 

We face intense competition in our market from our competitors, including manufacturers of animal-based meat products and other brands that produce plant-based meat products, and potential competitors and new market entrants and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to compete successfully. 

Our future success depends, in large part, on our ability to implement our long-term growth strategy of expanding supply and distribution, improving placement of our products, attracting new consumers to our brand and introducing new products and product extensions, and expanding into new geographic markets. If we fail to implement this growth strategy or if we invest resources in a growth strategy that ultimately proves unsuccessful, our sales and operating results will be adversely affected. Our ability to implement this growth strategy depends, among other things, on our ability to: 

&#8226; successfully implement our cost-reduction initiatives and cost down strategy in the nearer term; 

&#8226; manage relationships with various suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors, customers and other third parties, and expend time and effort to integrate new suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors and customers into our fulfillment operations; 

&#8226; continue to compete in retail and foodservice channels; 

&#8226; secure placement in the meat case for our products; 

&#8226; increase our brand recognition and expand and maintain brand loyalty; 

&#8226; develop new product lines and extensions; and 

&#8226; expand into new geographic markets. 

Our ability to implement our long-term growth strategy also depends on our ability to continue to compete in the retail and foodservice channels. We operate in a highly competitive environment. Numerous brands and products compete for limited retailer shelf space, foodservice customers and consumers. In our market, competition is based on, among other things, taste, price and promotion tactics, nutritional profile, ingredients, texture, ease of integration into the consumer diet, low-carbohydrate, low-sugar, high fiber and protein, lack of cholesterol and GMOs, convenience, versatility, brand awareness and loyalty among customers, media spending, product variety and packaging, access to major retailer shelf space and retail locations, access to major foodservice outlets and integration into menus, innovation and intellectual property protection. 

In response to increased competition, as well as reduced consumer confidence, changes in consumer spending and potential recessionary and inflationary pressures, we have made changes in our pricing architecture including price increases of certain of our products in our U.S. retail and foodservice channels, and may in the future make changes, which may have a negative impact on our net revenues, gross profit, gross margin and profitability, impacting period-over-period results. 

We compete with conventional animal-protein companies such as Cargill, Hormel, JBS, Perdue Foods and Tyson, who may have substantially greater financial and other resources than us and whose animal-based products are well-accepted in the marketplace today. They may also have lower operational costs, and as a result may be able to offer conventional animal meat to customers at lower costs than plant-based meat. This could cause us to lower our prices, resulting in lower profitability or, in the alternative, cause us to lose market share if we fail to lower prices. 

We also compete with other food brands, including brands affiliated with conventional animal-protein companies and other large food operators, that develop and sell plant-based meat products, including, but not limited to, Boca Foods (Kraft Heinz), Lightlife and Field Roast (Maple Leaf Foods), Gardein (Conagra), Hungry Planet, Inc., Impossible Foods, Incogmeato/Morningstar Farms (Kellanova), Moving Mountains, Omnipork (OmniFoods), Tofurky, Sweet Earth and Awesome Burger (Nestl&#233; S.A.), Raised &#38; Rooted (Tyson), Happy Little Plants (Hormel), Sysco&#8217;s Simply Plant-Based Meatless Burger, The Not Company and Vegetarian Butcher (Unilever), and with companies which may be more innovative, have more resources and be able to bring new products to market faster and to more quickly exploit and serve niche markets. This includes mycelium-based meat alternatives, such as Quorn, Meati and Nature&#8217;s Fynd, which leverage fermentation technology to create products with a texture and nutritional profile similar to animal proteins. Furthermore, a number of U.S. and international companies are working on developing lab-grown or &#8220;clean meat,&#8221; an animal-protein product cultivated from cells taken from animals, which could have a similar appeal to consumers as plant-based meat products. We compete with these competitors for foodservice customers, retailer shelf space and consumers. 

Generally, the food industry is dominated by multinational corporations with substantially greater resources and operations than us. We cannot be certain that we will successfully compete with larger competitors that have greater financial, sales and technical resources or with new competitors and market entrants. Conventional food companies may acquire our competitors or launch their own plant-based meat products, and they may be able to use their resources and scale to respond to competitive pressures and changes in 

consumer preferences by introducing new products, reducing prices or increasing promotional activities, among other things. Retailers also market competitive products under their own private labels, which are generally sold at lower prices and compete with some of our products. Similarly, retailers could change the merchandising of our products and we may be unable to retain the placement of our products in meat cases to effectively compete with animal-protein products. Competitive pressures, new competitors and market entrants or other factors could cause us to lose market share, which may require us to lower prices, increase marketing and advertising expenditures, or increase the use of discounting or promotional campaigns, each of which would adversely affect our margins and could result in a decrease in our operating results and profitability. 

Our brand and reputation may be diminished due to real or perceived quality or health issues with our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition. 

We believe our consumers rely on us to provide them with high-quality plant-based meat products. Therefore, real or perceived quality or food safety concerns or failures to comply with applicable food regulations and requirements, whether or not ultimately based on fact and whether or not involving us (such as incidents involving our competitors), could cause negative publicity and reduced confidence in our company, brand or products, or the industry as a whole, which could in turn harm our reputation and sales, and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Although we believe we have a rigorous quality control process, there can be no assurance that our products will always comply with the standards set for our products, and although we strive to keep our products free of pathogenic organisms, they may not be easily detected and cross-contamination can occur. There is no assurance that this health risk will always be preempted by our quality control processes. 

We have no control over our products once purchased by consumers. Accordingly, consumers may prepare our products in a manner that is inconsistent with our directions or store our products for long periods of time, which may adversely affect the quality and safety of our products. If consumers do not perceive our products to be safe or of high quality, including concerns regarding whether certain of our products are perceived as &#8220;ultra-processed&#8221; or otherwise contribute to health conditions, then the value of our brand would be diminished, and our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected. 

Any loss of confidence on the part of consumers in the ingredients used in our products or in the safety and quality of our products would be difficult and costly to overcome. Any such adverse effect could be exacerbated by our position in the market as a purveyor of high-quality plant-based meat products and may significantly reduce our brand value. Issues regarding the safety of any of our products, regardless of the cause, may have a substantial and adverse effect on our brand, reputation and operating results. 

The growing use of social and digital media by us, our consumers and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative publicity about us, our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our sales and profits could be negatively impacted. 

If we fail to develop and maintain our brand, our business could suffer. 

We have developed a strong and trusted brand that has contributed significantly to the success of our business, and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and grow the value of the Beyond Meat brand. Maintaining, promoting and positioning our brand and reputation will depend on, among other factors, the success of our plant-based product offerings, food safety, quality assurance, marketing and merchandising efforts, the nutritional benefits provided by our products and our ability to provide a consistent, high-quality customer experience. Negative publicity has adversely affected our business in the past, and any widespread negative publicity, regardless of its accuracy, could in the future materially adversely affect our business, results of operation and reputation. Brand value is based on perceptions of subjective qualities, and any incident that erodes the loyalty of our customers, suppliers or co-manufacturers, including adverse publicity, negative media or a governmental investigation or litigation, could significantly reduce the value of our brand and significantly damage our business. 

Risks Related to Our International Operations 

Our international operations could expose us to substantial business, regulatory, political, financial and economic risks. 

Our international operations could expose us to substantial risks, such as risks associated with taxation, inflation, food labeling legislation, environmental regulations, foreign currency exchange rates, the labor market, property and financial regulations, public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the outbreak of hostilities or war. Our ability to operate internationally may be adversely affected by changes in, or our failure to comply with, foreign laws and regulations. In addition, we are exposed to risks associated with our international workforce, including with respect to changes in employment and labor laws, which could increase our operating costs. There is also significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and other countries, including China, Canada and Mexico, with respect to trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs. 

In February 2025, we made a number of strategic decisions, including the decision to suspend our operational activities in China and reduce our workforce in China by 95%. For additional information, see Part I, Item 1A . Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Our Business&#8212;Our strategic initiatives to improve our cost structure could have long-term adverse effects on our business, and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions, including achieving and/or sustaining our profitability and financial performance objectives . See also, Note 15 , Subsequent Events, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. 

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could negatively impact our earnings. 

A portion of our international business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and therefore changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar have in the past, and may in the future, affect the value of our non-U.S. dollar net assets, revenues and expenses. For example, in 2024, we recorded $6.3 million in net realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction losses due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro and Chinese Yuan, as compared to $1.1 million in net realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains due to favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the Euro and Chinese Yuan in 2023. Although we closely monitor potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies, and where cost&#8209;justified we adopt strategies that are designed to reduce the impact of these fluctuations on our financial performance, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in managing our foreign exchange risk. Our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations will grow if the relative contribution of our operations outside the United States increases. Any material fluctuations in currencies could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

Our international operations are subject to the FCPA and we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws. 

The FCPA and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making certain improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The continued expansion of our international operations could increase the risk of violations of these laws in the future. There is no assurance that we will be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with the FCPA or any other applicable anti-corruption laws. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Likewise, any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws or trade control laws by the United States could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

In February 2025, President Trump signed an executive order pausing all future investigations and enforcement actions under the FCPA for at least 180 days until the attorney general issues revised FCPA enforcement guidance. Due to the changing nature of the regulatory environment and uncertainty about the 

priorities and direction of the U.S. presidential administration, we cannot be certain if or how the Department of Justice&#8217;s enforcement of the FCPA will change or impact our business. 

Risks Related to Our Investments 

Our international manufacturing operations have required and may continue to require substantial investments and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. The planned suspension of our operational activities in China is expected to result in significant accelerated depreciation and impairment charges in 2025. 

Our substantial investment in manufacturing facilities in China and Europe have exposed and may continue to expose us to substantial risks and, as a result, we may not realize a return on our investment. For example, although we invested a significant amount to establish local operations in China, in February 2025, we made the decision to suspend our operational activities in China. As such, we have not realized a sufficient return on our investment in China and expect to incur certain cash and non-cash charges in connection with the planned suspension of operational activities in China. We expect to incur one-time, non-cash charges of approximately $12.0 million to $17.0 million, primarily related to accelerated depreciation and impairment charges and other write-downs on certain fixed assets in China. For additional details regarding the planned suspension of our operational activities in China, see Part I, Item 1A . Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business&#8212;Our strategic initiatives to improve our cost structure could have long-term adverse effects on our business, and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions, including achieving and/or sustaining our profitability and financial performance objectives. 

Unforeseen delays in the suspension of our operational activities in China may cause us to incur additional expenses. Operating or otherwise repurposing or disposing of this facility may require additional capital expenditures and the efforts and attention of our management team and other personnel, which will divert resources from our existing business or operations. In addition, our manufacturing facility in Enschede, the Netherlands may not provide us with all of the operational and financial benefits we expect to receive. These and other risks may result in our not realizing a return on, or losing some or all, of our investments in China and Europe, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and financial performance. 

Our ownership of real property is subject to all the risks inherent in an investment in real estate. 

We have direct ownership of certain real estate properties. As is the case with any owner of real property, we are subject to potential liabilities, cost and damages arising out of owning, operating, leasing or otherwise having interests in real property. There are risks that a property may have unforeseen environmental or other hazards resulting in unexpected costs. In addition, we may not be able to expand or operate our owned facilities in the manner we desire, which could adversely impact our production and facility utilization. 

The divestiture, discontinuation or suspension of businesses and product lines, including the discontinuation of our Beyond Meat Jerky product line and suspension of our operational activities in China, could result in unexpected liabilities and adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. 

From time to time, we may divest, discontinue or suspend businesses and product lines that do not align with our strategy or provide the returns that we expect or desire, such as our decision in 2023 to discontinue the Beyond Meat Jerky product line, which resulted in related charges due to provision for excess and obsolete inventory and accelerated depreciation on certain fixed assets, and our decision in February 2025 to suspend our operational activities in China, which is expected to result in certain cash and non-cash charges related to, among other things, severance payments, employee benefits and related costs, as well as accelerated depreciation and impairment charges and other write-downs of certain fixed assets in China. Any decision to dispose of or otherwise exit, discontinue or suspend product lines or businesses, including the foregoing, may result in loss of significant revenues and investments and/or the recording of charges, such as write-offs, further workforce reductions or restructuring costs, charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or capacity underutilization, lease exit or other related costs, contract termination charges, or claims from third parties. Underutilization or cessation of our manufacturing facilities could adversely affect our gross margin and other 

operating results and we may be required to terminate or make penalty payments under certain supply chain arrangements, close or idle facilities, write down our long-lived assets, or shorten the useful lives and accelerate depreciation of our assets, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property, Information Technology, Cybersecurity and Privacy 

We may not be able to protect our proprietary technology adequately, which may impact our commercial success. 

Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies. We rely on a combination of patent protection, where appropriate and available, copyrights, trade secrets and trademark laws, as well as confidentiality and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology. However, these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our proprietary technology or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. As of December 31, 2024, we had four issued patents in the United States, nine issued patents outside the United States (U.K., Canada, China, Chile, Israel (two), Brazil, Japan and Australia), one pending patent application in the United States, five pending international patent applications and one provisional patent applications. 

We cannot offer any assurances about which, if any, patents will issue from these applications, the breadth of any such patents, or whether any issued patents will be found invalid and unenforceable or will be threatened by third parties. Any successful opposition to these patents or any other patents owned by or, if applicable in the future, licensed to us could deprive us of rights necessary for the successful commercialization of products that we may develop. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing (in most cases 18 months after the filing of the priority application), we cannot be certain that we were the first to file on the technologies covered in several of the patent applications related to our technologies or products. Furthermore, a derivation proceeding can be provoked by a third party, or instituted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications. 

Patent law can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important principles remain unresolved. In the United States and in many international jurisdictions, policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in patents can be inconsistent and/or unclear. The U.S. Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have made, and will likely continue to make, changes in how the patent laws of the United States are interpreted. Similarly, international courts and governments have made, and will continue to make, changes in how the patent laws in their respective countries are interpreted. We cannot predict future changes in the interpretation of patent laws by U.S. and international judicial bodies or changes to patent laws that might be enacted into law by U.S. and international legislative bodies. 

We may not be able to protect our intellectual property adequately, which may harm the value of our brand. 

We believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed significantly to the success of our business. Our trademarks are valuable assets that reinforce our brand and consumers&#8217; favorable perception of our products. We also rely on unpatented proprietary expertise, recipes and formulations and other trade secrets and copyright protection to develop and maintain our competitive position. Our continued success depends, to a significant degree, upon our ability to protect and preserve our intellectual property, including our trademarks, trade dress, trade secrets and copyrights. We rely on confidentiality agreements and trademark, trade secret and copyright law to protect our intellectual property rights. 

Our confidentiality agreements with our employees and certain of our consultants, contract workers, suppliers and independent contractors, including some of our co-manufacturers who use our formulations to manufacture our products, generally require that all information made known to them be kept strictly confidential. Nevertheless, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Although we attempt to protect our trade secrets, our confidentiality agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our proprietary information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information. If we do not keep our 

trade secrets confidential, others may produce products with our recipes or formulations. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets, in which case we would not be able to assert trade secret rights against such parties. Further, some of our formulations have been developed by or with our suppliers and co-manufacturers. As a result, we may not be able to prevent others from using similar formulations. As we begin to expand globally as part of our long-term growth strategy, we may face additional risks protecting our trade secrets internationally, where the laws may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States. 

We cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights are adequate, that our intellectual property rights can be successfully defended and asserted in the future or that third parties will not infringe upon or misappropriate any such rights. In addition, our trademark rights and related registrations may be challenged in the future and could be canceled or narrowed. Failure to protect our trademark rights could prevent us in the future from challenging third parties who use names and logos similar to our trademarks, which may in turn cause consumer confusion or negatively affect consumers&#8217; perception of our brand and products. Moreover, intellectual property disputes and proceedings and infringement claims may result in a significant distraction for management and significant expense, which may not be recoverable regardless of whether we are successful. Such proceedings may be protracted with no certainty of success, and an adverse outcome could subject us to liabilities, force us to cease use of certain trademarks or other intellectual property or force us to enter into licenses with others. Any one of these occurrences may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Additionally, the laws of certain international jurisdictions in which our products may be sold may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may not be able to effectively prevent third parties from infringing or otherwise misappropriating our trademark rights in such jurisdictions. Moreover, failure to obtain adequate trademark rights in these foreign jurisdictions could negatively impact our ability to expand our business and launch products in certain international markets. Further, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized third parties that obtain the rights to our trademarks in foreign jurisdictions where we have not yet applied for trademark protections, and we may expend substantial cost to obtain those trademarks from such third parties. Any one of these occurrences could reduce our competitive position or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

We rely on information technology systems, and any inadequacy, failure, interruption or security breaches of those systems, including those of third parties upon which we rely, may harm our ability to effectively operate our business. 

We and the third parties upon which we rely are dependent on various information technology systems, including, but not limited to, networks, applications and outsourced services in connection with the operation of our business. A failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies and loss of sales, causing our business to suffer. In addition, our information technology systems, and those of the third parties upon which we rely, may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including cyber attacks, fire, severe weather, natural disasters, systems failures, viruses and security breaches, particularly in light of many of our employees working remotely. Any such damage or interruption could materially disrupt our systems and operations, supply chain and ability to produce, sell and distribute our products and may have a material adverse effect on our business. 

A cybersecurity incident, other technology disruptions or failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to privacy and the protection of data relating to individuals could negatively impact our business, our reputation and our relationships with customers. 

We use computers in substantially all aspects of our business operations. We also use mobile devices, social networking and other online activities to connect with our employees, suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors, customers and consumers. Such uses give rise to cybersecurity risks, including security breaches, espionage, system disruption, theft and inadvertent release of information. Our business involves the storage 

and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information and intellectual property, including customers&#8217; and suppliers&#8217; information, private information about employees and financial and strategic information about us and our business partners. Further, as we pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure, potentially including acquisitions, we may also expand and improve our information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk. If we fail to assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with new initiatives or acquisitions, we may become increasingly vulnerable to such risks. 

Breaches of our data systems, or those of our vendors and other third parties on which we rely, whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber-attacks, hacking, &#8220;phishing&#8221; attacks, computer viruses, ransomware or malware, employee or insider error, malfeasance, social engineering, vendor software supply chain compromises, physical breaches or other actions, could result in material interruptions or malfunctions in our or such third parties&#8217; websites, applications or data processing, or the disruption of other business operations. A successful cyber-attack against any of our supply chain vendors&#8217; information technology systems may disrupt our supply chain. In April 2023, one of our temperature-controlled warehousing vendors received evidence that its computer network was affected by a cybersecurity incident, which negatively impacted our net sales and resulted in our recovery of $2.0 million in business interruption insurance in the third quarter of 2024. Also, in November 2024, we were informed of a ransomware cybersecurity incident experienced by a co-manufacturer. We do not believe this incident materially affected our business or financial results. These and similar disruptions of our supply chain could result in material adverse impacts on our revenue, business, financial condition or results of operations, including affecting customer demand, orders that may not materialize due to delayed deliveries and subsequent lost sales that we may not be able to recover in full, or at all. Additionally, while we have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and cyber incidents, our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective. There can be no assurance that our cybersecurity risk management program and processes, including our policies, controls or procedures, will be fully implemented, complied with or effective in protecting our systems and information. The theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely, could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential liability and competitive disadvantage all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. Currently, we carry cybersecurity insurance and business interruption coverage to mitigate certain potential losses, but this insurance is limited in amount and may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to a cybersecurity breach and related business and system disruptions. We cannot be certain that such potential losses will not exceed our policy limits, insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. In addition, we may be subject to changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements. 

Additionally, the SEC has adopted rules on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance and Incident Disclosure which require public companies to report information relating to certain cyber-attacks or other information security breaches in disclosures required to be made under the federal securities laws. Our compliance with these rules may increase our costs of doing business, expose us to potential compliance risk, including the ability to make timely disclosures to the public, and impact the manner in which we operate. Any such cyber incidents involving our computer systems and networks, or those of third parties important to our business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 

In addition, we are subject to laws, rules and regulations in the United States, the European Union, China and other jurisdictions relating to the collection, use and security of personal information and data. Such data privacy laws, regulations and other obligations may require us to change our business practices and may negatively impact our ability to expand our business and pursue business opportunities. We may incur significant expenses to comply with the laws, regulations and other obligations that apply to us. Additionally, the 

privacy and data protection-related laws, rules and regulations applicable to us are subject to significant change. Several jurisdictions have passed new laws and regulations in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions. For example, our operations are subject to the European Union&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation, which imposes data privacy and security requirements on companies doing business in the European Union, including substantial penalties for non-compliance. The California Consumer Privacy Act (the &#8220;CCPA&#8221;), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, imposes similar requirements on companies handling data of California residents and creates a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for (i) violations of the CCPA and (ii) businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. The California Privacy Rights Act, which became effective January 1, 2023, amends and expands the CCPA, including by expanding consumer&#8217;s rights in their personal information and creating a new governmental agency to interpret and enforce the statute. Additionally, in August 2021, the National People&#8217;s Congress of the People's Republic of China adopted the Personal Information Protection Law, which became effective on November 1, 2021 and provides a comprehensive system for the protection of personal information in China. Privacy and data protection-related laws and regulations also may be interpreted and enforced inconsistently over time and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Any actual or perceived inability to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, regulations, or other obligations could result in significant cost and liability, litigation or governmental investigations, damage our reputation and adversely affect our business. 

Risks Related to Our Lease Obligations, Indebtedness, Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital 

If the build out of our Campus Headquarters is delayed or incurs cost overruns, does not operate in accordance with our expectations, or if we are unable to build out or occupy the rest of the Campus Headquarters and cannot negotiate a partial lease termination, or sublease, assign or otherwise transfer the unoccupied space on terms favorable to us or at all, which may result in penalty payments, impairment charges and/or write-offs, our business or financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. 

In 2021, we entered into a lease agreement for an initial term of 12 years to develop and house our Campus Headquarters. The Campus Headquarters is being built out by the Landlord, who delivered Phase 1-A of the Campus Headquarters to us in the third quarter of 2022 and Phase 1-B of the Campus Headquarters to us in the second quarter of 2023. We currently do not have firm timing on the delivery of the rest of the Campus Headquarters. If we cannot complete development of the Campus Headquarters for any reason or within the approved budget, or if there are significant cost overruns and/or delays in the development of the Campus Headquarters, our cash flows, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we may not be able to build out or occupy the rest of the Campus Headquarters and are considering subleasing, assigning or otherwise transferring the unoccupied space, or negotiating a partial lease termination but may be unable to enter into or negotiate such an agreement or partial termination, which could have an adverse effect on our operating and financial results. An agreement to partially terminate, sublease, assign or otherwise transfer the unoccupied part of the Campus Headquarters would be subject to certain risks and uncertainties. For example, the agreement may not be completed on terms advantageous to us because the rental rate we receive under the agreement may not fully cover the rental rate we pay under the Campus Lease for the same space or our subtenants may fail to make lease payments, which may result in impairment charges for right-of-use assets and prepaid lease costs and could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a partial termination of the lease could result in a penalty payment to exit the lease and non-cash write-off of prepaid lease costs, the amounts of which could be material and which could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 

In addition, the period in which the improvement allowance was available to us to fund the build out of the Campus Headquarters ended on September 30, 2024 under the Campus Lease. Our inability to use the improvement allowance to build out the rest of the Campus Headquarters may limit us from further developing and occupying, or subleasing, assigning, or otherwise transferring the rest of the Campus Headquarters. Further, there could be unanticipated difficulties in initiating and maintaining operations at the Campus 

Headquarters, including, but not limited to, IT system interruptions, other infrastructure support problems or the Campus Headquarters may prove less conducive to our operations than currently anticipated. These risks could all result in operational inefficiencies or similar difficulties that could prove difficult or impossible to remedy and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 

We currently have, and will continue to have, significant lease obligations, and our failure to meet those obligations could adversely affect our financial condition and business. 

We currently have, and will continue to have, significant lease obligations for our corporate offices, manufacturing facilities, research and development facilities and warehouses. We depend on cash flows from operating activities to pay our lease expenses. 

If our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to fund these expenses, we may not be able to meet our lease obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and business. Furthermore, the significant cash flow required to satisfy our financial obligations under the leases could limit our ability to incur indebtedness and make capital expenditures or other investments in our business. 

Our significant indebtedness and liabilities could limit the cash flow available for our operations, expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. 

As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $1.3 billion of consolidated indebtedness and other liabilities. We may also incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. Our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for our security holders and our business, results of operations and financial condition by, among other things: 

&#8226; increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; 

&#8226; limiting our ability to obtain additional equity/or debt financing; 

&#8226; requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flows from operating activities to service our indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes; 

&#8226; limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business; 

&#8226; diluting the interests of our existing stockholders as a result of issuing shares of our common stock upon conversion or exchange of the Notes, which may also reduce the trading price of our common stock; and 

&#8226; placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with competitors that are less leveraged than us or have better access to capital. 

In 2021, we issued a total of $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of the Notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;). 

Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our current or future indebtedness, including the Notes, as applicable, depends on our future performance and our ability to raise additional capital, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to refinance the Notes on terms satisfactory to us, or at all. Such financing and other potential financings could result in substantial dilution to stockholders, and could result in the reduction in the trading price of our common stock, imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations, or other restrictions that may adversely affect our business. Based on our current business plan, we expect to raise additional capital to pay amounts due under our current or future indebtedness, including the Notes, and our cash needs may increase in the future. In addition, any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate our business, raise capital or make payments under 

our other indebtedness. If we fail to comply with these covenants or to make payments under our indebtedness when due, then we would be in default under that indebtedness, which could, in turn, result in that and our other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full, and could cause us to become insolvent or enter bankruptcy proceedings. 

Additionally, if our liquidity position is impaired, we may be required to take further actions in relation to management of liabilities on our balance sheet. Any actions in relation to liability management and balance sheet restructuring may materially reduce the value of our common stock, dilute existing holders of our common stock by the conversion of existing liabilities into equity or result in the cancellation of existing common stock. 

We may be unable to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the Notes for cash following a fundamental change, or to pay the cash amounts due upon conversion, and our future indebtedness may limit our ability to repurchase the Notes or pay cash upon their conversion. 

Holders of the Notes may, subject to a limited exception, require us to repurchase their Notes following a &#8220;Fundamental Change&#8221; (as defined in the indenture governing the Notes (the &#8220;Indenture&#8221;)) at a cash repurchase price generally equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special and additional interest, if any. In addition, all conversions of Notes will be settled partially or entirely in cash. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to repurchase the Notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. In addition, applicable law, regulatory authorities and the agreements governing our future indebtedness may restrict our ability to repurchase the Notes or pay the cash amounts due upon conversion. Our failure to repurchase the Notes or to pay the cash amounts due upon conversion when required will constitute a default under the Indenture. A default under the Indenture or the Fundamental Change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness, which may result in that indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. If the repayment of such future indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, then we may not have sufficient funds to repay that indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon their conversion and could cause us to become insolvent or enter bankruptcy proceedings. 

The accounting method for the Notes could adversely affect our reported financial condition and results. 

The Notes do not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the Notes do not accrete. However, special interest and additional interest may accrue on the Notes at a rate per annum not exceeding 0.50% (subject to certain exceptions) upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the failure to file certain SEC reports or to remove certain restrictive legends from the Notes. The accounting method for reflecting the Notes on our balance sheet may adversely affect our reported earnings and financial condition. If any of the conditions to the convertibility of the Notes is satisfied or the Notes become due within one year, then we may be required under applicable accounting standards to reclassify the liability carrying value of the Notes as a current, rather than a long-term, liability. This reclassification could be required even if no noteholders convert their Notes and could materially reduce our reported working capital. 

We early adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-06, &#8220;Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging&#8212;Contracts in Entity's Own Equity&#8221;, to account for the Notes which eliminates the treasury stock method for convertible instruments that can be settled in whole or in part with equity and instead requires the application of the more dilutive of the &#8220;if-converted&#8221; method or the two-class method. Under the if-converted method, diluted earnings per share would generally be calculated assuming that all the conversion premium or spread were converted at the beginning of the reporting period, unless the result would be anti-dilutive. The conversion premium or spread would have a dilutive impact on net income per share when the average market price of the Company&#8217;s common stock for a given period exceeds the conversion price. 

The capped call transactions may affect the value of the Notes and our common stock. 

In connection with the Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with the option counterparties. The capped call transactions will cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of common stock that underlie the Notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to our common stock upon conversion of the Notes or at our election (subject to certain conditions) offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction or offset subject to a cap. 

We have been advised that, in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates purchased shares of our common stock and/or entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock. 

In addition, we have been advised that the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions following the pricing of the Notes and prior to the maturity of the Notes (and are likely to do so on each exercise date of the capped call transactions, and in connection with any early termination event in respect of the capped call transactions). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock. 

Provisions in the Indenture governing the Notes could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover of us. 

Certain provisions in the Notes and the Indenture could make a third party attempt to acquire us more difficult or expensive. For example, if a takeover constitutes a fundamental change, then noteholders will have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes for cash. In addition, if a takeover constitutes a Make-Whole Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture), then we may be required to temporarily increase the conversion rate. In either case, and in other cases, our obligations under the Notes and the Indenture could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management, including in a transaction that holders of our common stock or Notes may view as favorable. 

We will require additional financing to achieve our goals, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, may force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product manufacturing and development, and other operations. 

Since our inception, substantially all of our resources have been dedicated to the development of our three core plant-based product platforms of beef, pork and poultry, including purchases of property, plant and equipment, principally to support the development and production of our products, the build-out and equipping of our former Manhattan Beach Project Innovation Center and our Innovation Center within our Campus Headquarters, and the purchase, build-out and equipping of manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and abroad. We have and believe that we will continue to expend resources as we expand into additional markets we may choose to pursue. These expenditures are expected to include costs associated with research and development, manufacturing and supply, as well as marketing and selling existing and new products. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. 

As of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash totaling $145.6 million. We expect to raise significant additional capital through the issuance of equity and/or debt securities, and/or incur other indebtedness to continue to fund our operations and repay our indebtedness in the future. To continue bolstering and restructuring our balance sheet, subject to our compliance with applicable laws, the applicable requirements of our equity distribution agreement, dated as of November 7, 2024 (the &#8220;Equity Distribution Agreement&#8221;), with B. Riley Securities, Inc. (&#8220;B. Riley&#8221;), as sales agent, under an &#8220;at the market&#8221; offering program (the &#8220;ATM Program&#8221;), and market conditions, we expect to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity and/or debt securities in 2025, through the ATM Program or otherwise, which will result in additional dilution to our existing stockholders and may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. 

Any issuance of equity or debt securities may be for cash or in exchange for our outstanding Notes, which could have a highly dilutive effect on current stockholders and could negatively affect the trading price of our common stock. In addition to resulting in additional dilution to our existing stockholders or negatively affecting the trading price of our common stock, any such potential financings may result in the imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations, or other restrictions that may adversely affect our business. Furthermore, any such securities issued pursuant to potential financings may include rights that are senior to our shares of common stock. In addition, the capital markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption, including high interest rates in certain geographic regions and higher borrowing costs, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, including our ability to access the capital markets to raise capital and meet liquidity needs. We may be unable to raise additional capital for reasons including, without limitation, our operational and/or financial performance, investor confidence in us and the plant-based meat industry, credit availability from banks and other financial institutions and the status of current projects. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully raise additional funds for the amounts needed or when needed, or on terms commercially acceptable, if at all. Our inability to raise required capital in the future would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will depend on many factors, including, among others: 

&#8226; demand in the plant-based meat category and for our products; 

&#8226; our rate of revenue generation; 

&#8226; the results of our Global Operations Review and the successful implementation of our ongoing cost-reduction initiatives, including the planned suspension of our operational activities in China; 

&#8226; timing to adjust our supply chain and cost structure in response to material fluctuations in product demand; 

&#8226; the number and characteristics of any additional products or manufacturing processes we develop or acquire to serve new or existing markets; 

&#8226; our investment in and build out of our Campus Headquarters, including the timing and success of subleasing, assigning or otherwise transferring excess space or negotiating a partial lease termination at our Campus Headquarters on terms advantageous to us or at all; 

&#8226; the success of, and expenses associated with, our marketing initiatives; 

&#8226; our investment in manufacturing and facilities to optimize our manufacturing and production capacity, including underutilization fees, termination fees and exit costs; 

&#8226; our investments in real property; 

&#8226; the costs required to fund domestic and international operations and growth; 

&#8226; the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing future products or improvements to existing products or manufacturing processes; 

&#8226; any lawsuits related to our products or commenced against us, including the class actions brought against us or the derivative actions brought against certain of our current and former directors and officers; 

&#8226; the expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel; 

&#8226; variations in product selling prices and costs; 

&#8226; the timing and success of changes to our pricing architecture within certain channels, and the mix of products sold; 

&#8226; the level of trade and promotional spending to support our products appropriately; 

&#8226; the expenses associated with our sales force; our management of accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and other working capital accounts; 

&#8226; the impact of foreign currency exchange fluctuations on our cash balances; 

&#8226; the costs associated with being a public company; 

&#8226; the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing intellectual property claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation; and 

&#8226; the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, any future approved products, if any. 

Additional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to: 

&#8226; delay, limit, reduce or terminate our manufacturing, research and development activities; or 

&#8226; delay, limit, reduce or terminate our establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities that may be necessary to generate revenue and achieve profitability. 

There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our business plan objectives or be able to achieve and/or sustain our profitability and financial performance objectives. If we are unable to generate adequate funds from operations and/or raise sufficient additional funds, we may not be able to repay our existing debt, including the Notes, continue to operate our business, respond to competitive pressures or fund our operations. As a result, we may be required to significantly reduce, reorganize, discontinue or shut down our operations. Any such failure could also cause us to become insolvent or enter bankruptcy proceedings. 

Our inability to access and employ the cash that collateralizes our outstanding and future letters of credit may impact our liquidity. 

As of December 31, 2024, we had $13.6 million in restricted cash, which was comprised of $12.6 million to secure the letter of credit to support the development and leasing of our Campus Headquarters and $1.0 million to secure a letter of credit associated with a new co-manufacturer in Europe. Our inability to access and employ the cash that collateralizes our outstanding and future letters of credit may impact our liquidity and could have an adverse impact on our business, operations and financial condition. 

Adverse developments affecting the financial services industry could adversely affect our current and projected business operations, our financial condition and results of operations. 

If failures in financial institutions occur where we hold deposits, we could experience additional risk and any such loss or limitation on our cash and cash equivalents would adversely affect our business. In addition, investor concerns regarding the U.S. or international financial systems could result in less favorable commercial financing terms, including higher interest rates or costs and tighter financial and operating covenants, or systemic limitations on access to credit and liquidity sources, thereby making it more difficult for us to acquire financing on terms favorable to us, or at all, and could have material adverse impacts on our liquidity, our business, financial condition or results of operations, and our prospects. Our business may be adversely impacted by these developments in ways that we cannot predict at this time, there may be additional risks that we have not yet identified, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to avoid negative consequences directly or indirectly from any failure of one or more banks or other financial institutions. 

Risks Related to the Environment, Climate and Weather 

A major earthquake, tsunami, tornado, wildfire, flood, drought or other natural disaster or severe weather event could seriously disrupt our entire business. 

We have offices, internal manufacturing and co-manufacturing facilities located in the United States and internationally. The impact of a major earthquake, tsunami, tornado, flood, wildfire, drought or other natural disaster or severe weather event at any of these facilities on our overall operations is difficult to predict, but such a natural disaster or severe weather event could seriously disrupt our entire business and lead to substantial losses, which may not be covered by insurance. Additionally, to the extent such events become more frequent or intense, such as a result of climate change, it may adversely impact the cost or availability of such insurance. 

Climate change may negatively affect our business and operations. 

Increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have generally been concluded to lead to increased ambient global temperatures, as well as changes in weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Adverse climate conditions, weather patterns and the impact of such conditions and patterns such as drought, flood, wildfires, mudslides and rising ambient temperatures adversely impact product cultivation conditions for farmers and agricultural productivity, including by disrupting ecosystems and severely altering the growing conditions, nutrient levels, soil moisture and water availability necessary for the growth and cultivation of crops, which would adversely affect the product quality, availability or cost of certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as yellow peas, sunflowers, rice, faba bean, avocado oil, canola oil and coconut oil. Water is a key ingredient in our products. Due to climate-related events, we may also be subjected to decreased availability of water, deteriorated quality of water or less favorable pricing for water, which could adversely impact our manufacturing and distribution operations. These and other changes to the physical environment may adversely impact our operations or those of the suppliers on whom we rely. While we may take various actions to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change, this may require us to incur substantial costs and may not be successful, due to, among other things, the uncertainty associated with the longer-term projections associated with managing climate risks. 

Risks Related to Being a Public Company 

If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and the trading price of our common stock may decline. 

Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. We continue to upgrade our information technology systems and implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures in order to keep up with the requirements of being a reporting company under the Exchange Act. 

As a public company, we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act so that our management can certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. We have and will continue to expend significant resources in developing the necessary documentation and testing procedures required by Section 404. We cannot be certain that the actions we have and will continue to take to improve our internal controls over financial reporting will be sufficient. 

Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, investors 

may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets. 

Our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud. 

Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. 

These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements or insufficient disclosures due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Compliance Matters, Litigation and Legal Proceedings 

Our operations are subject to FDA governmental regulation and other foreign, federal, state and local regulation, and there is no assurance that we will be in compliance with all regulations. 

Our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, and other foreign, federal, state and local authorities. Specifically, for products manufactured or sold in the United States we are subject to the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (&#8220;FDCA&#8221;) and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA. 

This comprehensive regulatory program governs, among other things, the manufacturing, composition and ingredients, packaging, labeling and safety of food. Under this program, the FDA requires that facilities that manufacture food products comply with a range of requirements, including hazard analysis and preventive controls regulations, current good manufacturing practices (&#8220;cGMPs&#8221;), and supplier verification requirements. Similarly, the FDA requires compliance with specific labeling requirements under the FDCA, including requirements regarding nutrient content claims about specific nutrients (such as saturated fat and protein) and the &#8220;healthy&#8221; nutrient content claim. The FDA recently finalized a rule that updates the requirements for a &#8220;healthy&#8221; claim that will impact our ability to use that claim in the future. The FDA has also proposed to require front of package nutrition labeling; if this requirement is finalized, it will impact our packaging in the U.S. and we will need to make changes in order to comply. 

Comparable regulations apply in foreign jurisdictions such as the European Union, the United Kingdom and China. Our processing and manufacturing facilities, including those of our co-manufacturers, are subject to periodic inspection by foreign, federal, state and local authorities. We do not control the manufacturing processes of, and rely upon, our co-manufacturers for compliance with cGMPs for the manufacturing of our products by our co-manufacturers. If we or our co-manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture products that conform to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or other non-U.S. regulators, we or they may be subject to adverse inspectional findings or enforcement actions, which could materially impact our ability to market our products, could result in our inability to manufacture our products or our co-manufacturers&#8217; inability to continue manufacturing for us, or could result in a recall of our product that has already been distributed. In addition, we rely upon our co-manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable state, local or foreign regulatory authority determines that we or these co-manufacturers have not complied with the applicable regulatory requirements, our business may be materially impacted. 

We seek to comply with applicable regulations through a combination of employing internal experience and expert personnel to ensure quality-assurance compliance (i.e., assuring that our products are not adulterated or misbranded) and contracting with third party laboratories that conduct analyses of products to ensure compliance with nutrition labeling requirements and to identify any potential contaminants before distribution. In the U.S., all of these requirements are subject to change, and enforcement priorities are also subject to change, based on political factors (e.g., changes in the presidential administration and resulting changes in key positions within the United States Department of Health and Human Services and FDA and agency policies) and also based on nutrition science (e.g., changes to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which are issued every five years). Failure by us or our co-manufacturers to comply with applicable laws and regulations or maintain permits, licenses or registrations relating to our or our co-manufacturers&#8217; operations could subject us to civil remedies or penalties, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, warning letters, restrictions or prohibitions on the marketing or manufacturing of products, or refusals to permit the import or export of products, as well as potential criminal sanctions, which could result in increased operating costs resulting in a material effect on our operating results and business. 

We are subject to international regulations that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 

We are subject to extensive regulations internationally where we manufacture, distribute and/or sell our products. Our products are subject to numerous food safety and other laws and regulations relating to the sourcing, manufacturing, composition and ingredients, storing, labeling, marketing, advertising and distribution of these products. For example, in early 2018, we received an inquiry from Canadian officials about the labeling and composition of products that we export to Canada. We responded promptly to that inquiry, identifying minor formulation changes that we made under Canadian regulations. If regulators determine that the labeling, advertising and/or composition of any of our products is not in compliance with foreign law or regulations, or if we or our co-manufacturers otherwise fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions where we operate and market products, we could be subject to civil remedies or penalties, such as fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, warning letters, restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the products, or refusals to permit the import or export of products, as well as potential criminal sanctions. In places like Mainland China, government inquiries into product labeling and advertising can be prompted by random inspections of our product on the market by local government authorities or complaints by consumers or competitors to the authorities. The consequences of a labeling or advertising violation in China can lead not only to fines from administrative authorities but also to multiple individual consumer lawsuits for nominal damages in the hundreds of dollars each, which can be costly to defend. In addition, enforcement of existing laws and regulations, changes in legal requirements and/or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs and create other obligations, financial or otherwise, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. For example, China has recently introduced new regulations on food manufacturing and it may introduce new Food Labeling Supervision Measures that could increase restrictions and require changes to our labels. In addition, with our international operations, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, our internal control policies and procedures may not protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, contractors or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 

Any changes in, or changes in the interpretation of, applicable laws, regulations or policies of the FDA or U.S. Department of Agriculture (the &#8220;USDA&#8221;), state regulators or similar foreign regulatory authorities that relate to the use of the word &#8220;meat&#8221; or other similar words in connection with plant-based meat products could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition. 

The FDA and the USDA, state regulators or similar foreign regulatory authorities, such as Health Canada or the CFIA, or authorities of the U.K., the EU or the EU member states, or China, including the State 

Administration for Market Regulation and its local counterpart agencies, could take action to impact our ability to use the term &#8220;meat&#8221; or similar words (such as &#8220;beef,&#8221; &#8220;burger&#8221; or &#8220;sausage,&#8221; including the Beyond Meat logo of the Caped Longhorn superhero) to describe or advertise our products. In addition, a food may be deemed misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular way, and the FDA, CFIA, EU member state authorities or other regulators could interpret the use of the term &#8220;meat&#8221; or any similar phrase(s) to describe our plant-based meat products as false or misleading or likely to create an erroneous impression regarding their composition. 

For example, the state of Missouri prohibits any person engaged in advertising, offering for sale, or sale of food products from misrepresenting a product as meat that is not derived from harvested production livestock or poultry. The state of Missouri Department of Agriculture has clarified its interpretation that products which include prominent disclosure that the product is &#8220;made from plants,&#8221; or comparable disclosure such as through the use of the phrase &#8220;plant-based,&#8221; are not misrepresented under the Missouri law. Additional states, including Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming, have subsequently passed similar laws, and legislation that would impose specific requirements on the naming of plant-based meat products has been introduced, but not enacted, in other states. The United States Congress considered (but did not pass) federal legislation, called the Real MEAT Act, that could require changes to our product labeling and marketing, including identifying products as &#8220;imitation&#8221; meat products, and that would give USDA certain oversight over the labeling of plant-based meat products. If similar bills gain traction and ultimately become law, we could be required to identify our products as &#8220;imitation&#8221; on our product labels. Further, the FDA recently issued draft guidance on naming plant-based meat alternatives that could impact our naming conventions on various products; while not binding, the guidance, when finalized, will reflect the FDA&#8217;s current thinking and expectations. Canadian Food and Drug Regulations also provide requirements for &#8220;simulated meat&#8221; products, including requirements around composition and naming. 

In Europe, the Agriculture Committee of the European Parliament proposed in May 2019 to reserve the use of &#8220;meat&#8221; and meat-related terms and names for products that are manufactured from the edible parts of animals. In October 2020, the European Parliament rejected the adoption of this provision. In the absence of European Union legislation, it was unclear whether member states remained free to establish national restrictions on meat-related names. In June 2020, France adopted a law prohibiting names to indicate foodstuffs of animal origin to describe, market or promote foodstuffs containing vegetable proteins. In October 2021, France published a draft implementing decree (the &#8220;Contested Decree&#8221;) to define, for example, the sanctions in case of non-compliance with the new law, and the Contested Decree went into effect in 2022. At the time, the Company took the view that the Contested Decree did not comply with the laws of the EU, in particular the principle of free movement of goods. In July 2022, at the request of a trade association, the French High Administrative Court partially suspended the execution of the Contested Decree. The Company filed an application for annulment against the Contested Decree and intervened in favor of the trade association in their pending case against the Contested Decree. Several plant-based companies filed voluntary intervention in support of the Company&#8217;s case on April 20, 2023. On July 12, 2023, the French High Administrative Court decided to refer the case to the CJEU. The CJEU was asked to decide on the lawfulness of the Contested Decree banning &#8220;meaty&#8221; names for plant-based protein under EU law. The procedure before the CJEU started on August 22, 2023, and the Company filed its submission on October 31, 2023. On January 15, 2024, the CJEU closed the written procedure. The period to request an oral hearing closed on February 5, 2024. 

In parallel to the litigation before the CJEU against the Contested Decree, on August 23, 2023, France published a proposal for a new decree replacing the Contested Decree (the &#8220;New Decree&#8221;). The New Decree removed some of the Contested Decree&#8217;s most open-ended language, but essentially maintained the prohibition on meaty names for plant-based proteins. The New Decree was subject to administrative review procedure by the European Commission (the EU&#8217;s executive body) and the EU member states other than France. The six-months standstill period under that procedure ended on February 23, 2024. The Company supported plant-based protein trade associations against the New Decree. On February 26, 2024, the New Decree was adopted. However, on April 10, 2024, the French High Administrative Court decided once again to postpone the applicability of the New Decree. The interim relief judge noted that there were serious doubts as to whether such national measures could be adopted based on EU law, which had already prompted the CJEU litigation. 

In this context, on March 1, 2024, the CJEU requested the French High Administrative Court to provide its view on the impact of the adoption of the New Decree on the litigation against the Contested Decree, and whether it should be declared moot or it should be allowed to proceed. On March 14, 2024, the French High Administrative Court responded to the CJEU's request for information asking it to rule in the proceedings. On April 15, 2024, the CJEU decided that the litigation against the Contested Decree would proceed, and that an oral hearing was not necessary. On October 4, 2024, the CJEU rendered its judgment. 

The judgment of the CJEU determined that the manner in which the Contested Decree seeks to ban meat names for plant-based foods is unlawful under EU law. It sets a precedent on the extent to which EU member states may regulate the naming of plant-based foods at the national level in the absence of harmonization at the EU level. In its judgment, the CJEU also ruled that &#8220;meat&#8221; is defined under EU law as &#8220;edible parts of certain animals.&#8221; The Company is taking the view that the CJEU&#8217;s interpretation only affects the use of the term in the sales denomination on the label and not the use of the term in marketing and advertising materials. Following the CJEU&#8217;s judgment, the case was referred to the French High Administrative Court, which, on January 28, 2025, annulled the Contested Decree and the New Decree. Beyond Meat will be reimbursed by the French State for legal costs incurred in challenging the Contested Decree, for a total of 3,000 euros. 

France was the first EU member state to adopt such a law, but others followed. On December 16, 2023, an Italian law prohibiting names to indicate foodstuffs of animal origin to describe, market or promote foodstuffs containing vegetable proteins (&#8220;Italian Law&#8221;) entered into force. The Italian Law requires the Ministry of Agriculture to adopt a decree with the names that may not be used to describe plant-based products by February 16, 2024. However, on January 29, 2024, the European Commission issued a formal letter informing the Italian government that the Italian Law was adopted in violation of EU law, and is thus not applicable or enforceable. On February 28, 2024, the Italian Minister for Agriculture confirmed that the adoption of an implementing decree is currently suspended. We are not aware of any steps taken by the Italian government to adopt the implementing decree, nor have the authorities attempted to enforce the Italian Law. The judgment of the CJEU concerning the French ban will likely affect the approach taken by Italy in the future. 

Separately, on December 5, 2023, Poland published a draft decree banning the use of meaty names to designate plant-based products. We are not aware of any additional developments in the legislative process. In June 2024, a Polish association of breeders requested that the Ministry of Agriculture advance the decree and regulate the use of meaty names. The judgment of the CJEU concerning the French ban will likely affect the approach taken by Poland in the future. 

The CJEU judgment has provided clarification on the ability of EU member states to adopt national legislation with respect to sales denominations for plant-based products in the absence of harmonization at the EU level. EU member states may reflect on the CJEU judgment and take a position on whether to adopt national measures. Such measures could affect our ability to use certain terms for our plant-based products in the future. 

Moreover, in light of the CJEU judgment, EU member state regulatory authorities may take action with respect to the use of the term &#8220;meat&#8221; or similar terms in advertising materials and other labeling (beyond the sales denomination), such that we are unable to use those terms with respect to our plant-based products, we could be subject to enforcement action or recall of our products marketed with these terms, we may be required to modify our marketing strategy, or required to identify our products as &#8220;imitation&#8221; in our product labels, and our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected. 

Increases in income tax rates or changes in income tax laws could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. 

Increases in income tax rates or other changes in tax laws, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, could adversely affect our financial performance. The increasingly complex global tax environment has in the past and could continue to increase tax uncertainty, resulting in higher compliance costs and adverse effects on our financial performance. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by numerous taxing authorities with respect to income and non-income based taxes. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, may make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation can differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse effect on our financial performance. 

Litigation or other legal or regulatory proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and have a negative impact on our reputation or business. 

Our business exposes us to significant potential risk from lawsuits, investigations, inquiries, examinations and other legal or regulatory proceedings. As a result, from time to time, we may be party to various claims and proceedings. We evaluate these claims and proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we may establish reserves, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from our assessments and estimates. For information regarding pending legal proceedings, please see Item 3 , Legal Proceedings, and Note 10 , Commitments and Contingencies , to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. 

Even when not merited, the attention these lawsuits, investigations, examinations and other legal or regulatory proceedings require, and the defense of any lawsuits or other proceedings, may divert our management&#8217;s attention and may cause us to incur significant expenses. The results of such proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some of these legal disputes may result in adverse monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows and results of operations. Any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future. 

Furthermore, while we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to self-insured retentions, various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable. Even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance, insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and, if the insurers prevail, the amount of our recovery. 

General Risk Factors 

Our share price has been and may continue to be highly volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment. 

The market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors discussed in this &#8220; Risk Factors &#8221; section, including: 

&#8226; general economic, market and political conditions, including the impact of inflation and higher interest rates across the economy and negative effects on consumer confidence and spending levels; 

&#8226; a further decrease in demand, and the underlying factors negatively impacting demand, in the plant-based meat category, which may continue to impact demand for our products; 

&#8226; actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results, including fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results; 

&#8226; announcements of innovations by us or our competitors; 

&#8226; announcement by competitors or new market entrants of their entry into or exit from the plant-based meat market; 

&#8226; overall conditions in our industry and the markets in which we operate; 

&#8226; market conditions or trends in the packaged food sales industry or in the economy as a whole; 

&#8226; addition or loss of significant customers or other developments with respect to significant customers; 

&#8226; adverse developments concerning our manufacturers or suppliers; 

&#8226; changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products or business; 

&#8226; our ability to effectively manage our cost-reduction initiatives and market expectations with respect to our cost-reduction initiatives; 

&#8226; speculation regarding public customer announcements or geographic expansion; 

&#8226; actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors; 

&#8226; announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments; 

&#8226; additions or departures of key personnel; 

&#8226; competition from existing products or new products that may emerge; 

&#8226; issuance of new or updated research or reports about us or our industry, or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts; 

&#8226; our failure to meet the estimates and projections of the investment community or that we may otherwise provide to the public; 

&#8226; fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us; 

&#8226; disputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, and our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our products; 

&#8226; litigation or regulatory matters; 

&#8226; announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts; 

&#8226; our cash position; 

&#8226; our indebtedness and ability to pay such indebtedness, as well as our ability to comply with covenants under our credit agreement; 

&#8226; sales of our common stock by our stockholders; 

&#8226; issuance of equity or debt; 

&#8226; share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our common stock; 

&#8226; changes in accounting practices; 

&#8226; ineffectiveness of our internal controls; 

&#8226; short-selling of our common stock; 

&#8226; negative media or marketing campaigns undertaken by our competitors or lobbyists supporting the meat industry; 

&#8226; the public&#8217;s response to publicity relating to the health aspects or nutritional value of our products; 

&#8226; the effects of COVID-19 and any other pandemic, epidemic or other public health crisis; and 

&#8226; other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control. 

Furthermore, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes, tariffs, international currency fluctuations, or the effects of disease outbreaks or pandemics (such as COVID-19), may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. For example, we are currently subject to a securities case filed against us alleging federal securities law violations with respect to past disclosure. We are also currently subject to multiple shareholder derivative lawsuits related, in part, to the securities case. Securities litigation, and any other type of litigation, brought against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management&#8217;s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations. 

Future sales or issuances of our common stock in the public market could cause our share price to fall. 

Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. For example, we may sell additional shares of common stock in public or private offerings, or pursuant to our ATM Program, and may also sell securities convertible into common stock. In addition, 8,234,230 shares of our common stock are reserved for potential issuance upon the conversion of the Notes. 

We expect to raise significant additional capital through the issuance of equity and/or debt securities, and/or incur other indebtedness to continue to fund our operations and repay our indebtedness in the future. To continue bolstering and restructuring our balance sheet, subject to our compliance with applicable laws, the applicable requirements of the Equity Distribution Agreement with B. Riley, as sales agent, under the ATM Program, and market conditions, we expect to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity and/or debt securities in 2025, through the ATM Program or otherwise, which will result in additional dilution to our existing stockholders and may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. Any issuance of equity or debt securities may be for cash or in exchange for our outstanding Notes, which could have a highly dilutive effect on current stockholders and could negatively affect the trading price of our common stock. In addition to resulting in additional dilution to our existing stockholders or negatively affecting the trading price of our common stock, any such potential financings may result in the imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations, or other restrictions that may adversely affect our business. Furthermore, any such securities issued pursuant to potential financings may include rights that are senior to our shares of common stock. 

Sales of our common stock, by us or otherwise, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares of our common stock intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. We cannot predict the size of future sales or issuances of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock or the effect, if any, that any such future sales or issuances will have on the market price of our common stock. 

If securities or industry analysts issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our business or publish unfavorable research about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline. 

The trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if any of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model or our stock performance, or if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of the investor community, our share price could decline. 

We have never paid dividends on our capital stock and we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. Consequently, any gains from an investment in our common stock will likely depend on whether the price of our common stock increases. 

We have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the operation of our business and for general corporate purposes. Accordingly, investors should rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. 

Our charter documents and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock. 

Our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include: 

&#8226; providing for a classified board of directors with staggered, three-year terms; 

&#8226; authorizing our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could discourage a takeover attempt or delay changes in control; 

&#8226; prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors; 

&#8226; providing that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; 

&#8226; prohibiting the adoption, amendment or repeal of our amended and restated bylaws or the repeal of the provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation regarding the election and removal of directors without the required approval of at least 66.67% of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors; 

&#8226; prohibiting stockholder action by written consent; 

&#8226; limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders; and 

&#8226; requiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals, including without limitation, compliance with the requirements of Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act, as applicable. 

These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law, or the DGCL, govern us. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time without the consent of our board of directors. 

These and other provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and result in the market price of our common stock being lower than it would be without these provisions. 

Our restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders&#8217; ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees. 

Our restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for: 

&#8226; any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; 

&#8226; any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or other wrongdoing by, any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders; 

&#8226; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws; 

&#8226; any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; and 

&#8226; any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine; 

with our amended and restated bylaws providing that stockholders will have been deemed to consent to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in the State of Delaware for such actions. In addition, our restated certificate of incorporation provides that with respect to any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, the exclusive forum will be the federal district courts of the United States of America. Our restated certificate of incorporation further provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. 

These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder&#8217;s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. 

Our ability to utilize our federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code (the &#8220;Code&#8221;). 

As of December 31, 2024, the Company has accumulated federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1.2 billion, $477.5 million and $107.1 million, respectively. Approximately $1.1 billion of the federal net operating losses and $76.1 million of the state net operating losses do not expire and the remaining federal, state and foreign tax loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2031, 2031 and 2025 respectively, unless previously utilized. Utilization of the Company&#8217;s net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Code and similar state provisions. 

The limitations apply if a corporation undergoes an &#8220;ownership change,&#8221; which is generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by certain stockholders over a three-year period. We have experienced several ownership changes none of which is expected to result in a material limitation on the future use of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards generated prior to these ownership changes. However, any future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger an ownership change and, consequently, Section 382 and 383 limitations. Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply to limit our use of accumulated state tax attributes. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset such taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future income tax liability to us. We are currently analyzing whether and to what extent we have experienced an ownership change pursuant to Section 382; and to the extent such change occurred, the impact to the availability of our tax attributes.

We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the ordinary course of our business. The following summarizes significant risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur. Further, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially affect our business. Readers should carefully consider the risk factors included below as well as those matters referenced in this Report under &#8220;Forward-Looking Statements&#8221; and other information included and incorporated by reference into this Report. 

Risks Relating to Our Business, Operations, and Strategy 

Table of Contents 

Part of our strategy involves using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques, which involve additional risks and uncertainties in their application compared to vertical drilling. 

Our operations use some of the latest horizontal drilling and completion techniques as developed by us, other oil and natural gas exploration and production companies and our service providers. The additional risks that we face while drilling horizontally include, but are not limited to, the following: 

&#8226; drilling wells that are significantly longer and/or deeper than vertical wells; 

&#8226; landing our wellbores in the desired drilling zones; 

&#8226; staying in the desired drilling zones while drilling horizontally through the formations; 

&#8226; running our casing the entire length of wellbores; and 

&#8226; being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through horizontal wellbores. 

Risks that we face while completing our horizontal wells include, but are not limited to, the following: 

&#8226; the ability to fracture or stimulate the planned number of stages in a horizontal wellbore; 

&#8226; the ability to run tools and other equipment the entire length of a wellbore during completion operations; and 

&#8226; the ability to successfully clean out a wellbore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage. 

If our assessments of purchased properties are materially inaccurate, it could have a significant impact on future operations and earnings. 

The successful acquisition of producing properties requires assessments of many factors, which are inherently inexact and may be inaccurate, including the following: 

&#8226; unforeseen title issues; 

&#8226; the amount of recoverable reserves; 

&#8226; future oil and natural gas prices; 

&#8226; estimates of operating costs; 

&#8226; estimates of future development costs; 

&#8226; estimates of the costs and timing of plugging and abandonment of wells; and 

&#8226; potential environmental and other liabilities. 

Our assessments will not reveal all existing or potential problems, nor will they permit us to become familiar enough with the potential properties we may acquire to assess fully their capabilities and deficiencies. We plan to undertake further development of our properties generally through the use of cash flow from existing production. Therefore, a material deviation in our assessments of these factors could result in less cash flow being available for such purposes than we presently anticipate, which could either delay future development operations (and delay the anticipated conversion of reserves into cash) or cause us to seek alternative sources to finance development activities. 

Prospects that we decide to drill may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities. 

Our prospects are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from prospects that are currently being drilled to prospects that will require substantial additional seismic data processing and interpretation. We are unable to predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular prospect will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable. This risk may be enhanced in our situation, due to the 

Table of Contents 

fact that a significant percentage of our proved reserves is currently proved undeveloped reserves. The use of seismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area may not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in commercial quantities. We cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data obtained by analyzing other wells, more fully explored prospects or producing fields will be applicable to all of our drilling prospects. 

A substantial percentage of our proved properties are undeveloped; therefore, the risk associated with our success is greater than would be the case if a substantial majority of our properties were categorized as proved developed. 

Because a substantial percentage of our proved properties are proved undeveloped (approximately 31%), we will require significant additional capital to develop such properties before they may become productive. Further, because of the inherent uncertainties associated with drilling for oil and gas, some of these properties may never be developed to the extent that they result in commercial quantities of oil and natural gas. 

While our current business plan is to generally fund the development costs with cash flow from our other producing properties, if such cash flow is not sufficient, we may be forced to seek alternative sources for cash, through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities, increased borrowings or other means. 

Hedging transactions may limit our potential gains . 

To reduce our exposure to commodity price uncertainty and increase cash flow predictability, we have entered into crude oil and natural gas price hedging arrangements with respect to a significant portion of our expected production in order to economically hedge a portion of our forecasted oil and natural gas production. Additionally, our credit facility requires us to hedge a significant portion of our production. These derivative contracts typically limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas. 

Hedging transactions may expose us to risk of financial loss. 

While intended to reduce the effects of volatile oil and natural gas prices, derivative contracts designed as hedges expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received, or when the counterparty to the derivative contract defaults on its contractual obligations. It is also possible that sales volumes fall below the hedged volumes leaving a portion of our position uncovered. 

We may be adversely affected by natural disasters, pandemics and other catastrophic events, and by man-made problems such as terrorism, that could disrupt our business operations. 

Natural disasters, adverse weather conditions (particularly abnormally cold weather in the winter, and hurricanes and thunderstorms in the summer), floods, pandemics, acts of terrorism and other catastrophic or geo-political events may cause damage or disruption to our operations and the global economy, or could result in market disruptions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. 

The recent coronavirus outbreak impacted various businesses throughout the world, including an impact on the global demand for oil and natural gas, travel restrictions and the extended shutdown of certain businesses in impacted geographic regions. If other pandemics occur, they could have a material adverse impact on our business operations, operating results and financial condition. 

The loss of key members of management or failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel could affect the Company&#8217;s business results. 

Our success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate a highly-skilled management team and workforce. Failure to ensure that we have the depth and breadth of management and personnel with the necessary skill sets and experience could impede our ability to achieve growth objectives and execute our operational strategy. As we continue to expand, we will need to promote or hire additional staff, and, as a result of increased compensation and benefit packages in our industry, as well as inflationary pressures, it may be difficult to attract or retain such individuals without incurring significant additional costs. 

Risks Relating to the Oil and Natural Gas Industry 

Table of Contents 

A substantial or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments. 

The prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production heavily influence our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. Oil and natural gas are commodities and, therefore, their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile and we expect these markets will continue to be volatile. The prices we receive for our production, and the levels of our production, depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: 

&#8226; changes in global supply and demand for oil and natural gas; 

&#8226; the actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC; 

&#8226; the actions of oil exporting countries that are not members of OPEC; 

&#8226; the price and quantity of imports and exports of oil and natural gas; 

&#8226; political conditions, including embargoes, in or affecting other oil-producing activities; 

&#8226; acts of war and related armed conflicts; 

&#8226; the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production activity; 

&#8226; the level of global oil and natural gas inventories; 

&#8226; weather conditions; 

&#8226; technological advances affecting energy consumption; and 

&#8226; the price and availability of alternative fuels. 

Lower oil and natural gas prices may not only decrease our revenues on a per Boe basis but also may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically. Lower prices also negatively impact the value of our proved reserves. A substantial or extended decline in oil or natural gas prices may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and ability to finance planned capital expenditures. 

Drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Our future success will depend on our exploitation, exploration, development, and production activities. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil or natural gas production. 

Our decisions to purchase, explore, develop, or otherwise exploit prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data, and engineering studies, the results of which may be inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. Please read &#8220;&#8212;Reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate.&#8221; (below) for a discussion of the uncertainty involved in these processes. Our cost of drilling, completing, and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences. Overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular well or project uneconomical. Further, many factors may curtail, delay, or cancel drilling, including delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements; pressure or irregularities in geological formations; shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel; equipment failures or accidents; adverse weather conditions; reductions in oil and natural gas prices; title problems; and limitations in the market for oil and natural gas.

Decreases in oil and natural gas prices may require us to incur write-downs of the financial carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties which could negatively impact the price of our common stock. 

Accounting rules require that we review periodically the financial carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties for possible impairment. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics, and other factors, we may be required to write-down the financial carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties. A write-down would likely constitute a non-cash charge. The cumulative effect of one or more write-downs could also negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. 

We follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties. Under the full cost method, the net book value of properties, less related deferred income taxes, may not exceed a calculated &#8220;ceiling.&#8221; The ceiling is the estimated after tax future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas properties, discounted at 10% per year. Discounted future net revenues are estimated using oil and natural gas spot prices based on the average price during the preceding 12-month period determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, except for changes which are fixed and determinable by existing contracts. The net book value is compared to the ceiling on a quarterly basis. The excess, if any, of the net book value above the ceiling is required to be written off as an impairment expense. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 we did not incur any write-downs. Under SEC full cost accounting rules, any write-off recorded may not be reversed even if higher oil and natural gas prices increase the ceiling applicable to future periods. Future price decreases could result in reductions in the financial carrying value of such assets and an equivalent charge on our financial statements. 

It is difficult to estimate with any degree of reasonable certainty the amount of any future impairments given the many factors impacting the ceiling test calculation including, but not limited to, future pricing, operating costs, upward or downward reserve revisions, reserve adds, and tax attributes. 

Decreases in oil and natural gas prices may affect our bank borrowing base, potentially requiring earlier than anticipated debt repayment, which could negatively impact our financial position, results of operations, and the price of our common stock. 

Decreases in oil and natural gas prices could result in reductions in the borrowing base under our Credit Facility, thus requiring earlier than anticipated repayment of debt or trigger a possible default under our Credit Facility in the event we are unable to make payments or repayments under the Credit Facility on a timely basis. 

Reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves. 

The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could negatively affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reported reserves. 

In order to prepare our estimates, we must project production rates and timing of development expenditures. We must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production, and engineering data. The extent, quality, and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes, and availability of funds. Therefore, estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise. 

Actual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will likely vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reported reserves. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. 

You should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our reported proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we generally base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on prices and costs calculated on the date of the estimate. Discounted future net revenues are estimated using oil and natural gas spot prices based on the average price 

Table of Contents 

during the preceding 12-month period determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, except for changes which are fixed and determinable by existing contracts. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate. If future values decline or costs increase it could negatively impact our ability to finance operations, and individual properties could cease being commercially viable, affecting our decision to continue operations on certain producing properties or to attempt to develop certain properties. All of these factors would have a negative impact on earnings and net income, and most likely the price of our common stock. These factors could also result in the acceleration of debt repayment and a reduction in our borrowing base under our Credit Facility. 

We may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil and natural gas operations. 

We are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and under insured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including the possibility of: 

&#8226; environmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas, or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater; 

&#8226; abnormally pressured formations; 

&#8226; mechanical difficulties, such as stuck oil field drilling and service tools and casing collapses; 

&#8226; fires and explosions; 

&#8226; personal injuries and death; and 

&#8226; natural disasters. 

Any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses. We may elect to not obtain certain insurance coverage if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance, it could materially and adversely affect us. 

Unless we replace our oil and natural gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline as reserves are produced. 

Unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Producing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production, and, therefore, our cash flow and income, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and producing our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. If we are unable to develop, find, or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production, our cash flow and income will decline as production declines, until our existing properties would be incapable of producing profitably. 

Competition is intense in the oil and natural gas industry. 

We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties and marketing oil and natural gas. Our competitors include multinational oil and natural gas companies, major oil and natural gas companies, independent oil and natural gas companies, individual producers, financial buyers, as well as participants in other industries that supply energy and fuel to consumers. Many of our competitors have greater and more diverse resources than we do. Additionally, competition for acquisitions may significantly increase the cost of available properties. We compete for the personnel and equipment required to explore, develop, and operate properties. Our competitors also may have established long-term strategic positions and relationships in areas in which we may seek to enter. Consequently, our competitors may be able to address these competitive factors more effectively than we can. If we are not successful in our competition for oil and 

Table of Contents 

natural gas properties or in our marketing of production, then our financial condition and operation results would be adversely affected. 

If our access to markets is restricted, it could negatively impact our production, our income, and our ability to retain our leases. 

Market conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas and the proximity of our producing properties to pipelines and terminal facilities. Our ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines, and processing facilities owned and operated by third parties. Our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2024, we experienced a negative price of $1.44 per Mcf of natural gas with negative net sales of approximately $9.3 million, adversely affecting our cash flows and net income. 

Currently, some of our production is sold to marketers and other purchasers that have access to pipeline facilities. Much of our production is in areas with limited or no access to pipelines, thereby necessitating delivery by trucking. Further, much of our natural gas production is sold to companies who are the only gathering and processing facilities near most of our properties. Such restrictions on our ability to sell our oil or natural gas could have several adverse effects, including higher transportation costs, fewer potential purchasers (thereby potentially resulting in increased exposure to facility breakdowns and a lower selling prices) or, in the event we were unable to market and sustain production from a particular lease for an extended time, possibly causing us to lose a lease due to lack of production. 

Many of our properties are in areas that may have been partially depleted or drained by offset wells and certain of our wells may be adversely affected by actions we or other operators may take when drilling, completing, or operating wells that we or they own. 

Many of our properties are in reservoirs that may have already been partially depleted or drained by earlier offset drilling. The owners of leasehold interests adjoining any of our properties could take actions, such as drilling and completing additional wells, which could adversely affect our operations. When a new well is completed and produced, the pressure differential in the vicinity of the well causes the migration of reservoir fluids toward the new wellbore (and potentially away from existing wellbores). As a result, the drilling and production of these potential locations by us or other operators could cause depletion of our proved reserves and may inhibit our ability to further develop our proved reserves. In addition, completion operations and other activities conducted on adjacent or nearby wells by us or other operators could cause production from our wells to be shut-in for indefinite periods of time, could result in increased lease operating expenses, and could adversely affect the production and reserves from our wells after they re-commence production. We have no control over the operations or activities of offsetting operators. 

Multi-well pad drilling may result in volatility in our operating results. 

We utilize multi-well pad drilling where practical. Because wells drilled on a pad are not brought into production until all wells on the pad are drilled and completed and the drilling rig is moved from the location, multi-well pad drilling delays the commencement of production from a given pad, which may cause volatility in our operating results. In addition, problems affecting one pad could adversely affect production from all wells on such pad. As a result, multi-well pad drilling can cause delays in the scheduled commencement of production or interruptions in ongoing production. 

Extreme weather conditions, which could become more frequent or severe due to multiple factors, could adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling, completion, and production activities in the areas where we operate. 

Our exploration and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions, such as abnormally low temperatures, which can cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity from regional power outages or lost or damaged facilities and equipment. For example, we had production stoppages in 2022, 2023, and 2024 that adversely affected our revenues. Extreme weather conditions could also impact access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations, maintenance, and repairs and the availability of and our access to, necessary third-party services, such as gathering, processing, compression, and transportation services. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay or temporarily halt our operations and materially increase our operation and capital costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Table of Contents 

Restrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate. 

Oil and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect certain wildlife, such as those restrictions imposed under the Endangered Species Act. Seasonal restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures. The designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration, development and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves. 

Our operations are substantially dependent on the availability, use and disposal of water. New legislation and regulatory initiatives or restrictions relating to water disposal wells could have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. 

Water is an essential component of our drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources, we may be unable to economically produce oil, natural gas and NGLs, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Waste water from our operations typically are disposed of via underground injection. Some studies have linked earth tremors in certain areas to underground injection, which has led to greater public scrutiny of disposal wells. Any new environmental initiatives or regulations that restrict injection of fluids, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and gas, or that limit the withdrawal, storage or use of surface water or ground water necessary for hydraulic fracturing of our wells, could increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or cessation of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, and all of which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 

Risks Relating to Legal, Regulatory, Privacy, and Tax Matters 

We are subject to complex laws that can affect the cost, manner, or feasibility of doing business. 

Exploration, development, production, and sale of oil and natural gas are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation. It is not possible to predict how or when regulations affecting our operations might change. There is ongoing controversy regarding the leasing of federal lands. We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with governmental regulations. Other matters subject to regulation include: discharge permits for drilling operations; drilling bonds; reports concerning operations; the spacing of wells; unitization and pooling of properties; and taxation. 

Under these laws, we could be liable for personal injuries, property damage, and other damages. Failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil, and criminal penalties. Moreover, these laws could change in ways that substantially increase our costs. Any such liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations, or regulatory changes could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

Our operations may incur substantial liabilities to comply with environmental laws and regulations. 

Our oil and natural gas operations are subject to stringent federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the release or disposal of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences; restrict the types, quantities, and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities; limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, and other protected areas; and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties; incurrence of investigatory or remedial obligations; or the imposition of injunctive relief. Changes in environmental laws and regulations and the interpretation thereof occur from time to time, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal, or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, competitive position, and financial condition as well as the industry in 

Table of Contents 

general. Under these environmental laws and regulations, we could be held strictly liable for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or if our operations were standard in the industry at the time they were performed. The amount of any additional future costs is not fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions or compliance efforts that may be required, the determination of the Company&#8217;s liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties. 

Our operations are subject to a series of risks arising out of the perceived threat of climate change that could result in increased operating costs, limit the areas in which we may conduct oil and natural gas exploration and production activities, and reduce demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. 

In the United States, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level, though recently passed laws such as the IRA advance numerous climate-related objectives. The IRA contains hundreds of billions of dollars in incentives for the development of renewable energy, clean hydrogen, clean fuels, electric vehicles, and supporting infrastructure and carbon capture and sequestration, among other provisions. Moreover, federal regulators, state and local governments, and private parties have taken (or announced that they plan to take) actions that have or may have a significant influence on our operations. International climate commitments made by political, industrial, and financial stakeholders may also impact commercial, regulatory, and consumer trends related to climate change. 

In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations pursuant to the CAA that, among other things, require PSD preconstruction and Title V operating permits for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, mandate monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions, and impose new standards for reducing methane emissions from oil and gas operations by limiting venting and flaring and implementing leak detection and repair programs. The IRA also imposes the first-ever fee on GHG emissions through a WEC, which the EPA has finalized regulations to implement. In May 2024, the EPA published a final rule expanding GHG emissions reporting obligations for certain oil and natural gas sector sources. While the first Trump administration took a number of actions to revise federal regulation of methane from the oil and natural gas sector, these actions were subsequently reversed by both the Biden administration and Congress. Moreover, in December 2023, the EPA published a final rule that established more stringent performance standards for new sources and first-time standards for existing sources under applicable agency regulations at 40 C.F.R. Part 60 for methane and VOC emissions for the crude oil and natural gas sources. The requirements imposed by this rule include enhanced leak detection and repair obligations, zero-emission requirements for certain processes and practices, &#8220;green well&#8221; completion standards, limitations on routine flaring, and a &#8220;Super Emitter Response Program&#8221; which triggers additional requirements following certain large emissions events. Compliance with these rules and legislation will likely require enhanced record-keeping practices, the purchase of new equipment, such as optical gas imaging instruments to detect leaks, increased frequency of maintenance and repair activities to address emissions leakage and additional personnel time to support these activities or the engagement of third-party contractors to assist with and verify compliance. While legal challenges to many of the above discussed regulations are ongoing and, either the current Trump administration or Congress may also pursue rulemakings or legislation, respectively, that could repeal, revise, or otherwise limit the enforcement of these regulations and certain of the IRA&#8217;s provisions, like the WEC, we cannot predict whether and when such action will be taken and the outcome and timeline for such actions may continue to be uncertain and subject to further legal challenges. 

Internationally, the United Nations-sponsored &#8220;Paris Agreement&#8221; encourages member states to individually determine and submit non-binding emissions reduction targets. The United States&#8217; most recent goal was to reduce its economy-net GHG emissions by 61 to 66 percent from 2005 levels by 2035. Recent Conferences of the Parties have resulted in reaffirmations of the objectives of the Paris Agreement, calls for parties to eliminate certain fossil fuel subsidies and pursue reductions in non-carbon dioxide GHG emissions, agreements to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems and increase renewable energy capacity, financial commitments to fund energy transition efforts in developing countries, and similar initiatives, though none legally binding. However, in January 2025, President Trump initiated the United States&#8217; withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and ordered the revocation of any related financial commitments. The impacts of the United States&#8217; withdrawal and other existing or future climate-related orders, pledges, agreements or any legislation or regulation promulgated in connection with the Paris Agreement, the Global Methane Pledge, or other international conventions cannot be predicted at this time. Further, state and local governments, financial institutions, and industry groups may elect to continue participating in international climate-related initiatives. 

In addition, on March 6, 2024, the SEC adopted a rule requiring registrants to include certain climate-related disclosures, including Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, climate-related targets and goals, and certain climate-related 

Table of Contents 

financial statement metrics, in registration statements and annual reports, though the implementation of this rules is currently paused pending the outcome of legal challenges against the rule. Currently, the ultimate impact of these laws on our business is uncertain. Separately, enhanced climate related disclosure requirements could lead to reputational or other harm with customers, regulators, investors, or other stakeholders and could also increase our litigation risks relating to statements alleged to have been made by us or others in our industry regarding climate change risks, or in connection with any future disclosures we may make regarding reported emissions, particularly given the inherent uncertainties and estimations with respect to calculating and reporting GHG emissions. Additionally, the SEC has also from time to time applied additional scrutiny to existing climate-change related disclosures in public filings, increasing the potential for enforcement if the SEC were to allege an issuer&#8217;s existing climate disclosures misleading or deficient. 

Increasingly, oil and natural gas companies are exposed to litigation risks associated with the threat of climate change. A number of parties have brought lawsuits against oil and natural gas companies in state or federal court for alleged contributions to, or failures to disclose the impacts of, climate change. We are not currently party to any such litigation, but could be named in future actions making similar claims of liability. To the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to our causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors. 

Additionally, in response to concerns related to climate change, companies in the oil and natural gas industry may be exposed to increasing financial risks. Financial institutions, including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth, pension, and endowment funds, may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-oil and natural gas related sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil-fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices, and some of them may elect in the future not to provide funding for oil and natural gas companies. Many of the largest U.S. banks have made net zero commitments and have announced that they will be assessing financed emissions across their portfolios and taking steps quantify and reduce those emissions. A material reduction in the capital available to the oil and natural gas industry could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration, development, production, transportation, and processing activities, which could result in decreased demand for our products or otherwise adversely impact our financial performance. 

The adoption and implementation of new or more stringent international, federal or state legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives related to climate change or GHG emissions from oil and natural gas facilities could result in increased costs of compliance or costs of consumption, thereby reducing demand for, oil and natural gas. Additionally, political, litigation, and financial risks may result in (i) restriction or cancellation of certain oil and natural gas production activities, (ii) incurrence of obligations for alleged damages resulting from climate change, or (iii) impairment of our ability to continue operating in an economic manner. One or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Moreover, climate change may also result in various physical risks such as the increased frequency or intensity of extreme weather events or changes in meteorological and hydrological patterns, that could adversely impact our financial condition and operations, as well as those of our suppliers or customers. Such physical risks may result in damage to our facilities, or otherwise adversely impact our operations, such as if we become subject to water use curtailments in response to drought, or demand for our products, such as to the extent warmer winters reduce the demand for energy for heating purposes. Such physical risks may also impact the infrastructure on which we rely to produce or transport our products. One of more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operations. In addition, while our consideration of changing weather conditions and inclusion of safety factors in design is intended to reduce the uncertainties that climate change and other events may potentially introduce, our ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part on the effectiveness of our facilities and our disaster preparedness and response and business continuity planning, which may not have considered or be prepared for every eventuality. 

Changes in tax laws or the interpretation thereof or the imposition of new or increased taxes or fees may adversely affect our operating results and cash flows. 

From time to time, federal and state level legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to tax laws, including to certain key federal and state income tax provisions currently applicable to oil and natural gas exploration and development companies. Such legislative changes have included, but have not been limited to, (i) the elimination of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures, (iv) the elimination of certain other tax deductions and relief previously available to oil and natural gas companies, and (v) an increase in the federal income tax rate applicable to corporations such as us. It is unclear 

Table of Contents 

whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could take effect. Additionally, states in which we operate or own assets may impose new or increased taxes or fees on oil and natural gas extraction. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals and other changes in federal income tax laws or the imposition of new or increased taxes or fees on oil and natural gas extraction could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows. 

In addition, the IRA, which includes, among other things, a corporate alternative minimum tax (the ""CAMT""), provides for an investment tax credit for qualified biomass property and introduces a one percent excise tax on corporate stock repurchases. Under the CAMT, a 15 percent minimum tax will be imposed on certain adjusted financial statement income of ""applicable corporations,"" which was effective beginning January 1, 2023. The CAMT generally treats a corporation as an applicable corporation in any taxable year in which the ""average annual adjusted financial statement income"" of the corporation and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates for a three-taxable-year period ending prior to such taxable year exceeds $1 billion. Based on our current interpretation of the IRA and the CAMT and a number of operational, economic, accounting and regulatory assumptions, we do not anticipate the CAMT materially increasing our U.S. federal income tax liability in the near term. The foregoing analysis is based upon our current interpretation of the provisions contained in the IRA and the CAMT. In the future, the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service are expected to release regulations and interpretive guidance relating to the CAMT, and any significant variance from our current interpretation could result in a change in the expected application of the CAMT to us and adversely affect our operating results and cash flows. 

Also, we are subject to unclaimed or abandoned property (escheat) laws which require us to turn over to certain government authorities the property of others held by us that has been unclaimed for a specified period. We are subject to audits by individual U.S. states regarding our escheatment practices. The legislation and regulations related to unclaimed property matters are complex and subject to varying interpretations by state governmental authorities. 

Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure 

We have significant indebtedness. 

We have a Credit Facility in place with $600 million in commitments from borrowings and letters of credit under our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated August 31, 2022 with Truist Bank as Administrative Agent (the ""Second Credit Agreement""). As of December 31, 2024, $385 million was outstanding on our Credit Facility. If we further utilize this facility, the level of our indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following: 

&#8226; a significant portion of our cash flow would need to be used to service the indebtedness; 

&#8226; we are required to put into place derivative contracts to hedge a significant portion of our oil and gas production; 

&#8226; a high level of debt would increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; 

&#8226; the covenants contained in our Credit Facility limit our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends, and make certain investments, and; 

&#8226; a high level of debt could impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate, or other purposes. 

In addition, our bank borrowing base is subject to semi-annual redeterminations. We could be required to repay a portion of our bank borrowings due to redeterminations of our borrowing base. If we are required to do so, we may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments, and we may need to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing or sell significant assets. Any such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Further, our borrowings under our Credit Facility expose us to interest rate risks, as it bears variable interest based upon a prime rate and is therefore susceptible to interest rate fluctuations. 

We may be unable to access the equity or debt capital markets to meet our obligations. 

Our plans for growth may include accessing the capital markets. Recent reluctance to invest in the exploration and production sector based on market volatility, historically perceived underperformance, and ESG trends, among other 

Table of Contents 

things, has raised concerns regarding capital availability for the sector. If those markets are unavailable, or if we are unable to access alternative means of financing on acceptable terms, we may be unable to implement all of our development plans, make acquisitions, or otherwise carry out our business strategy, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and impair our ability to service our indebtedness. 

We continue to be impacted by inflationary pressures on our operating costs and capital expenditures. 

Beginning in the second half of 2021 and continuing throughout 2024, we, similar to other companies in our industry, experienced inflationary pressures on our operating costs and capital expenditures - namely the costs of fuel, steel (i.e., wellbore tubulars), labor, and drilling and completion services. Such inflationary pressures on our operating and capital costs, which we currently expect to continue in 2025, have impacted our cash flows and results of operations. We have undertaken, and plan to continue with, certain initiatives and actions (such as agreements with service providers to secure the costs and availability of services) to mitigate such inflationary pressures. However, there can be no assurance that such efforts will offset, largely or at all, the impacts of any future inflationary pressures on our operating costs and capital expenditures and, in turn, our cash flows and results of operations. 

Risks Relating to Technology and Cybersecurity 

We rely on computer and telecommunications systems, and failures in our systems or cyber security attacks or breaches could result in information theft, data corruption, disruption in operations, and/or financial loss. 

The oil and natural gas industry is highly dependent upon digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations including certain exploration, development, and production activities. We depend on digital technology to process and record financial and operating data, estimate quantities of oil and natural gas reserves, analyze seismic and drilling information, process and store personally identifiable information on our employees and royalty owners, and communicate with our employees and other third parties. Our business partners, including vendors, service providers, purchasers of our production, and financial institutions, are also dependent on digital technology. It is possible that we could incur interruptions from cybersecurity attacks or breaches, computer viruses or malware that could result in disruption of our business operations and/or financial loss. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and protect against these threats and mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing and causing us to suffer losses in the future. In addition, weaknesses in the cyber security of our vendors, suppliers, and other business partners could facilitate an attack on our technologies, systems, and networks. Even so, any cyber incidents or interruptions to our computing and communications infrastructure or our information systems could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, or destruction of proprietary or other information, or otherwise significantly disrupt our business operations. 

As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyberattacks. In particular, our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities, and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs. A cyberattack or security breach could result in liability under data privacy laws, regulatory penalties, damage to our reputation, or loss of confidence in us, or additional costs for remediation and modification or enhancement of our information systems to prevent future occurrences, all of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. While we maintain insurance that covers certain cybersecurity incidents, we may not be insured for, or our insurance may be insufficient to protect us against, particular types of cybersecurity risks, and, in the future, such insurance may not continue to be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all. To date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks; however, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. Consequently, it is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Risks Relating to Our Common Stock 

We have registered shares of our common stock for possible resale by certain of our stockholders, resulting in significant ""market overhang"" of our common stock. 

In connection with the Stronghold Acquisition completed in 2022, Warburg Pincus &#38; Company US, LLC and its affiliates hold approximately 28.9 million shares of our common stock. This represents approximately 14% of our presently 

Table of Contents 

outstanding shares of common stock and if the selling stockholders choose to sell all or a large number of their shares, from time to time, it likely would have a depressive effect on the market price of our common stock. Further, the market's perception of future sales of common stock may adversely affect the price of our common stock. 

The market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of your investment to decline. 

The stock markets have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock may also fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors, some of which are beyond our control: 

&#8226; our operating and financial performance and prospects; 

&#8226; variations in our quarterly operating results and changes in our liquidity position; 

&#8226; investor perceptions of us and the industry and markets in which we operate; 

&#8226; future sales, or the availability for sale, of equity or equity-related securities; 

&#8226; changes in securities analysts&#8217; estimates of our financial performance; 

&#8226; changes in market valuations of similar companies; 

&#8226; changes in the price of oil and natural gas; and 

&#8226; general financial, domestic, economic, and other market conditions. 

We currently do not pay cash dividends on our common stock. 

We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business. Our future dividend policy is within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon various factors, including our business, financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, and investment opportunities. In addition, the terms of our Second Credit Agreement have restrictions on dividend payments to our equity holders, including our common stockholders. 

Our Board of Directors can, without stockholder approval, cause preferred stock to be issued on terms that could adversely affect common stockholders. 

Under our Articles of Incorporation, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which none are issued and outstanding as of the date of this Annual Report. Also, our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, may determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions, including voting rights, of those shares. If the Board of Directors causes shares of preferred stock to be issued, the rights of the holders of our common stock could be adversely affected. The Board of Directors&#8217; ability to determine the terms of preferred stock and to cause its issuance, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. Preferred shares issued by the Board of Directors could include voting rights, or even super voting rights, which could shift the ability to control the Company to the holders of the preferred stock. Preferred shares could also have conversion rights into shares of common stock at a discount to the market price of the common stock which could negatively affect the market for our common stock. In addition, preferred shares would typically have preference in the event of liquidation of the Company, which means that the holders of preferred shares would be entitled to receive the net assets of the Company distributed in liquidation before the common stockholders receive any distribution of the liquidated assets. We have no current plans to issue any shares of preferred stock. 

Provisions under Nevada law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock. 

In addition to the ability of the Board of Directors to issue preferred stock, the existence of some provisions under Nevada law could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company, which could adversely affect the price of our 

Table of Contents 

common stock. Nevada law imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 10% or more of our outstanding common stock.

GWRS,"Global Water Resources, Inc.",https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1434728/000143472825000079/gwrs-20241231.htm," ITEM 1A. Risk Factors 

In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations in future periods. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations in future periods. 

Legal, Regulatory, and Legislative Factors 

New or stricter regulatory standards or other governmental actions could increase our regulatory compliance and operating costs, require us to alter our existing distribution or treatment facilities, and/or cause us to build additional facilities, which could cause our profitability to suffer, particularly if we are unable to increase our rates to offset such costs. 

In Arizona, water and wastewater utilities are subject to regulation by water, environmental, public utility and health and safety regulators, and the Company&#8217;s utilities are required to obtain environmental permits from governmental agencies in order to operate their facilities. Applicable regulations relate to, among other things, standards and criteria for drinking water quality and for wastewater discharges, customer service and service delivery standards, waste disposal and raw groundwater abstraction limits and rates, and charges for our regulated service. There may be instances in the future when the Company is not in compliance, or cannot achieve compliance with new and evolving laws, regulations, and permits without incurring additional operating costs. 

To comply with federal, state and local environmental laws, our existing facilities may need to be altered or replaced, which may cause us to incur significant additional costs. Altered and new facilities and other capital improvements must be constructed and operated in accordance with multiple requirements, including, in certain cases, an Aquifer Protection Permit issued by the ADEQ, Arizona Pollution Discharge Elimination System permits from the ADEQ and an air quality permit from Maricopa or Pinal Counties. The provision of potable water is subject to, among others, the requirements of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, and effluent from wastewater treatment facilities must comply with other requirements. Regulated contaminants and associated maximum contaminant levels may change over time, requiring us to alter or build additional treatment facilities. 

Our costs of complying with current and future governmental laws and regulations could adversely affect our business or results of operations. If we fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators and our operations could be curtailed or shut down. We may also be exposed to product liability or breach of contract claims by third parties resulting from our noncompliance. These laws and regulations are complex and change frequently, and these changes may cause us to incur costs in connection with the remediation of actions that were lawful when they were taken. Failure by us to observe the conditions and comply with the requirements of permits and other applicable laws and regulations could result in delays, additional costs, fines and other adverse consequences, including the inability to proceed with development in our service areas. 

We may incur higher compliance or remediation costs than expected in any particular period and may not be able to pass those increased costs along to our customers immediately through rate increases, or at all. This is because we must obtain regulatory approval to increase our rates, which can be time-consuming and costly and our requests for increases may not be approved in part or in full. 

We are required to test our water quality for certain parameters and potential contaminants on a regular basis. If the test results indicate that parameters or contaminants exceed allowable limits, we may be required either to commence treatment to remedy the water quality or to develop an alternate water source. Either of these outcomes may be costly, and there can be no assurance that the regulatory authorities would approve rate increases to recover these additional compliance costs. In addition, by the time that test results are available, contaminated water may have been provided to customers, which may result in liability for us and damage our reputation. 

In addition, governments or government agencies that regulate our operations may enact legislation or adopt new requirements that could have an adverse effect on our business, including: 

&#8226; restricting ownership or investment; 

&#8226; providing for the expropriation of our assets by the government through condemnation or similar proceedings; 

&#8226; providing for changes to water and wastewater quality standards; 

&#8226; requiring cancellation or renegotiation of, or unilateral changes to, agreements relating to our provision of water and wastewater service; 

&#8226; changing regulatory or legislative emphasis on water conservation in comparison to other goals and initiatives; 

&#8226; promoting an increase of competition among water companies within our designated service areas; 

&#8226; requiring the provision of water or wastewater service at no charge or at reduced prices; 

&#8226; restricting the ability to terminate service to customers whose accounts are in arrears; 

&#8226; restricting the ability to sell assets or issue securities; 

&#8226; adversely changing tax, legal or regulatory requirements, including employment, property ownership or general business regulations; 

&#8226; changing environmental requirements and the imposition of additional requirements and costs on our operations; 

&#8226; changes in the charges applied to raw water abstraction; 

&#8226; changes in rate making policies; or 

&#8226; restrictions relating to water use and supply, including restrictions on use, increased offsetting groundwater replenishment obligations, changes to the character of groundwater rights and settlement of Native American claims. 

We are subject to the jurisdiction and regulations of the ACC, the primary utility regulator in Arizona, and our financial condition depends upon our ability to recover costs in a timely manner from customers through regulated rates. 

We are subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal, state and local regulatory agencies that significantly influence our business, liquidity and results of operations. In particular, the ACC is the regulatory authority with jurisdiction over privately-held water and wastewater utilities and our ability to fully recover costs from utility customers in a timely manner. The ACC has exclusive constitutional authority related to ratemaking and extensive constitutional authority to mandate accounting treatments, authorize long-term financing programs, evaluate significant capital expenditures and plant additions, examine and regulate transactions between a regulated subsidiary and its affiliated entities and approve or disapprove some reorganizations, mergers and acquisitions prior to their completion. Additionally, the ACC has statutory authority to oversee service quality and consumer complaints and approve or disapprove expansion of service areas. The ACC is comprised of five elected members, each serving four-year terms. Our profitability is affected by the rates we may charge and the timeliness of recovering costs incurred through our rates. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon the satisfactory resolution of any rate proceedings and ancillary matters which may come before the ACC. In addition, the ACC may reopen prior decisions and modify otherwise final orders under certain circumstances. Decisions made by the ACC could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

We have significant obligations under ICFAs, yet funds from our ICFAs are dependent on development activities by developers which we do not control, and are also subject to certain regulatory requirements. 

Prior to 2014, we extended water and wastewater infrastructure financing to developers and builders through ICFA contracts. Our investment can be considerable, as we phase-in the construction of facilities in accordance with a regional master plan, as opposed to a single development. Developers and builders pay us agreed-upon fees upon the occurrence of specified development events for their development projects. The ACC requires us to record a portion of the funds we receive under ICFAs as CIAC, which are funds or property provided to a utility under the terms of a collection main extension agreement and/or service connection tariff, the value of which are not refundable. Amounts received as CIAC and expended on construction projects reduce our rate base once utility plants are placed in service. 

The developer is not required to pay the bulk of the agreed-upon fees until a development receives platting approval. Accordingly, we cannot always accurately predict or control the timing of the collection of our fees. If a developer encounters difficulties, such as experienced during the Great Recession and associated real estate market downturn, that result in a complete or partial abandonment of the development or a significant delay in its completion, such as experienced with the Company&#8217;s Southwest Plant, we will have planned, built and invested in infrastructure that will not be supported by development and will not generate either payments under the applicable ICFA or cash flows from providing service. As a result, our return on our investment and cash flow stream could be adversely affected. 

Our water and wastewater systems are subject to condemnation by governmental authorities, which may result in the receipt of less than the fair market value of our assets, and a loss of revenue from our operations . 

Municipalities and other governmental subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water and wastewater service, and efforts may arise from time to time to convert some or all of our assets to public ownership and operation. Arizona law provides for the acquisition of public utility property by governmental agencies through their power of eminent domain, 

also known as condemnation. For example, the assets of our former utility subsidiaries, Cave Creek Water Co. and Valencia Water Company, Inc., were acquired from us by municipalities pursuant to condemnation proceedings, and our other utility subsidiaries could be subjects of such proceedings in the future. Should a municipality or other governmental subdivision seek to acquire some or all of our assets through eminent domain, we would likely resist the acquisition. 

Contesting an exercise of condemnation through eminent domain may result in costly legal proceedings and may divert the attention of our management from the operation of our business. Moreover, our efforts to resist any such condemnation may not be successful. 

If a municipality or other governmental subdivision succeeds in acquiring some or all of our assets through eminent domain, there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for such assets and that we will incur significant one-time charges. Condemnation also results in a loss of revenue from the operations of the affected utility. 

Proposals to change utility policy in Arizona made through legislative, regulatory, or ballot initiatives may impact our growth, business plans, and financial condition. 

In Arizona, a person or organization may file a ballot initiative with the Arizona Secretary of State and, if a sufficient number of verifiable signatures are submitted, the initiative may be placed on the ballot for the public to vote on the matter. Ballot initiatives may relate to any matter, including taxes and policy and regulation related to our industry, and may change statutes or the state constitution in ways that could impact our customers, the Arizona economy, and the Company. The passage of certain initiatives could depress expected population growth, impact our business or growth plans and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

Changes in, interpretations of, or enforcement trends related to tax rules and regulations may adversely affect our effective income tax rates or operating margins and we may be required to pay additional tax assessments. 

Our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by various factors, many of which are outside of our control, including: 

&#8226; changes in tax laws, regulations, and/or interpretations of such tax laws in multiple jurisdictions, including but not limited to U.S. federal and state regulations or interpretations resulting from the TCJA; 

&#8226; increases in corporate tax rates and the availability of deductions or credits; 

&#8226; tax effects related to purchase accounting for acquisitions; and 

&#8226; resolutions of issues arising from tax examinations and any related interest or penalties. 

Our determination of tax liabilities is always subject to review or examination by applicable tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of such review or examination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. Our calculation of the provision for income taxes is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file. In addition, our income tax returns are subject to periodic examination by the IRS and other taxing authorities. 

We are exposed to various risks relating to legal proceedings or claims that could materially adversely affect our operating results. 

GWRI and its subsidiaries are occasionally a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business. Responding to lawsuits brought against us &#8212; and litigation in general &#8212; can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. Unfavorable outcomes from these claims and/or lawsuits could materially adversely affect GWRI&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition, and we could incur substantial monetary liability and/or be required to change our business practices. 

Our ability to expand into new service areas and to expand current water and wastewater service depends on approval from regulatory agencies. Failure to obtain required regulatory approvals will adversely affect future growth. 

In Arizona, the ACC is the regulatory authority that oversees the formation, expansion and ongoing operations of water and wastewater utilities. The ACC has authority, among other things, to determine service areas for utility providers. In order for our owned utilities to provide water or wastewater service, they must obtain a CC&#38;N for a service area before they can service that area. In addition, our owned utilities and/or the developments that we serve must demonstrate to the ADWR that there 

exists a 100-year water supply and obtain either a CAWS, which is a certificate issued by the ADWR evidencing sufficient groundwater, surface water, or effluent of adequate quality will be continuously available to satisfy the water needs of the proposed use for at least one hundred years and which applies to a specific subdivision, or a DAWS, which applies to the utility&#8217;s entire service area. The designation area is generally coterminous with the CC&#38;N and can grow into adjacent areas as needed. Further, our wastewater facilities require ADEQ and/or EPA permits that regulate, among other things, the level of discharges from our facilities, the size of our facilities and the location of our facilities. Any inability to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals, assured water supplies or environmental permits would limit our ability to expand our water or wastewater service areas. 

If we chose to expand to states other than Arizona, we may have difficulty acquiring the necessary approvals and permits or complying with environmental, health and safety or quality standards of such states. See &#8220;&#8212;Business and Operational Factors &#8212; Doing business in jurisdictions other than Arizona may present unforeseen regulatory, legal and operational challenges that could impede or delay our operations or adversely affect our profitability.&#8221; 

We are subject to environmental risks that may subject us to clean-up costs or litigation that could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and prospects. 

Under various federal and state environmental laws, regulations, ordinances and other requirements, a current or previous owner or operator of real property or a facility may be liable for the costs of removal, remediation or containment of hazardous or toxic substances on, under, in or released from such property. These liabilities are not limited to a potential effect on our water supply and include, but are not limited to, liabilities associated with air, soil or groundwater contamination at any real estate or facilities we own or operate, including liabilities assumed in an acquisition of another utility. Environmental laws often impose liability regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. Although we currently conduct environmental screening assessments on new properties that we propose to acquire or use to identify significant sources of contaminants on surrounding properties, these assessments are not comprehensive, nor have they been conducted for all of the property owned or used by us. As a result, hazardous or toxic substances may exist at properties owned or used by us. If previously unknown hazardous or toxic substances are discovered at real property or facilities owned or used by us (including a landfill owned by another party that is used by us for disposal of hazardous substances), we could incur significant remediation costs, liability exposure or litigation expenses that could adversely affect our profitability, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. 

Business and Operational Factors 

The risk of natural adverse weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks, global political events, war or terrorism could disrupt our business, impacting operating costs and capital expenditures. 

Our facilities are located in areas which have been and could be subject to natural disasters such as drought, floods, fires or earthquakes. Adverse weather conditions or other extreme changes in the weather, including resulting electrical and technological failures, may disrupt our business and adversely affect operating costs and capital expenditures. In addition, our service areas are susceptible to pandemic outbreaks, terrorist acts and operations may be affected by disruptive political events, both global and domestic, such as civil unrest in countries in which our vendors are located or products are manufactured, and in the U.S. where protests and other disturbances may affect our ability to operate. 

We do not control when and where a developer may request service within our service areas, and if this occurs outside the location and capacity of existing infrastructure, it may require significantly more capital expenditures than currently anticipated. 

If a developer has an ICFA, and/or once a developer has entered into a service agreement with our utility subsidiary and the property being developed has been included within a service area, we have the obligation to serve under the terms of those agreements and existing regulations. Although we have built substantial modern infrastructure within these utilities in areas where development is currently occurring, there is the potential that a developer may request service in another location within the service area. Extending/expanding the existing infrastructure to provide service may result in the need to make additional, currently unplanned, capital improvements, and there is no guarantee that we may recover our costs timely. As a result, our return on our investment and cash flows could be adversely affected. 

Inadequate water supplies and wastewater capacity could have a material adverse effect upon our ability to achieve the customer growth necessary to increase our revenue. 

Our ability to meet the existing and future water demands of our customers depends on an adequate supply of water. In many areas of Arizona (including certain areas that we service), water supplies are limited and, in some cases, current usage rates 

exceed sustainable levels for certain water resources. Additionally, regulatory restrictions on the use of groundwater and the development of groundwater wells, lack of available water rights, drought, overuse of local or regional sources of water, protection of threatened species or habitats or other factors, including climate change, may limit the availability of ground or surface water. No assurance can be given that we will be able to produce or purchase enough water to fully satisfy future customer demand. Further, we can make no guarantee that we will always have access to an adequate supply of water that will meet all quality standards, or that the cost of water will not adversely affect our operating results. 

As discussed above, we currently rely predominantly on the pumping of groundwater and the generation and delivery of recycled water for non-potable uses to meet future demands in our service areas. At present, groundwater (and recycled water derived from groundwater) is the primary water supply available to us. In areas where we have not applied for a DAWS, we have not performed hydrological studies or modeling to evaluate the amount of groundwater likely to be available to meet present and expected future demands. Insofar as we intend to rely on the pumping of groundwater and the generation and delivery of recycled water to meet future demands in our current service areas, our ability and/or the ability of developers inside of our service areas to meet regulatory requirements and to demonstrate assured and adequate water supplies is essential to the continued growth of our service connections and our capacity to supply water to our customers. In the event that our wells cannot meet customer demand, we may, under certain circumstances, purchase water from surrounding municipalities, agencies and other utilities. However, the cost of purchasing water is typically more expensive than producing it. Furthermore, these alternative sources may not always have an adequate supply to sell to us. 

Insufficient availability of water or wastewater treatment capacity could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide for expected customer growth necessary to increase revenue. We continuously look for new sources of water to augment our reserves in our service areas, but we have not yet obtained material surface water rights. Our ability to obtain such rights may depend on factors beyond our control, such as the future availability of Colorado River water supplies. We also plan to construct facilities and obtain the necessary permits to recharge recycled water to stretch and augment our existing and planned future water supplies, but we do not yet have this capability in all of our service areas. As a result, it is possible that, in the future, we will not be able to obtain sufficient water or water supplies to increase customer growth necessary to increase or even maintain our revenue. 

If we are unable to access adequate water supplies, such water shortage could adversely affect our business operations, results of operations, cash flows and financial position in a variety of other ways, which may include, but are not limited to, the following: 

&#8226; water rationing; 

&#8226; adverse changes to water supply mix, causing us to rely on more expensive purchased water; 

&#8226; increased operating costs; 

&#8226; increased risk of contamination to water systems due to the inability to maintain sufficient pressure; 

&#8226; increased capital expenditures for building pipelines to connect to alternative sources of supply, new wells to replace those that are no longer in service or are otherwise inadequate to meet the needs of customers and reservoirs and other facilities to conserve or reclaim water; and 

&#8226; regulatory authorities refusing to approve new service areas if an adequate water supply cannot be demonstrated and restricting new customer connections in existing service areas if there is not sufficient water. 

We may or may not be able to recover increased operating and construction costs as a result of water shortages on a timely basis, or at all, for our regulated utilities through the rate setting process. 

If we do not manage our anticipated growth effectively, we may not be able to develop or implement the infrastructure necessary to support our operations and could suffer a loss of profitability. 

Although we may not be able to achieve similar growth as we have seen since our formation in 2003, or any growth at all, in future periods, we expect to continue to significantly expand our facilities, infrastructure, marketing, testing, management and administrative operations, as well as our financial and accounting controls. This expansion has placed, and will continue to place, strain on our management and administrative, operational, technical and financial infrastructure. If management is unable to manage growth effectively, the quality of our service, our ability to attract and retain key personnel and our business or prospects could be harmed significantly. 

To manage growth effectively, we must: 

&#8226; continue to expand our water management capacity; 

&#8226; retain key management and augment our management team; 

&#8226; continue to enhance our technology, operations and financial and management systems; 

&#8226; manage multiple relationships with our customers, regulators, suppliers and other third parties; and 

&#8226; expand, train and manage our employee base. 

We may not be able to effectively manage any expansion in one or more of these areas, and our failure to do so could harm our ability to maintain or increase revenue and operating results. The expenses incurred in pursuing growth could increase without a corresponding increase in our revenue base, which could decrease operating results and profit margin. In addition, future growth may require us to make significant capital expenditures or incur other significant expenses and may divert the attention of our personnel from our core business operations, any of which could affect our financial performance adversely. 

Increased operating expenses associated with the expansion of our business may negatively impact our operating income. 

Increased operating expenses associated with any expansion of our business may negatively impact our income as we, among other things: 

&#8226; seek to acquire new utilities and service areas; 

&#8226; expand geographically within and outside of Arizona; 

&#8226; make significant capital expenditures to support our ability to provide service in our existing service areas; 

&#8226; fund development costs for our system and technology; and 

&#8226; incur increased general and administrative expenses as we grow. 

As a result of these factors, we may not sustain or increase our profitability on an ongoing basis. 

We face risks associated with the design, construction, and operation of our systems that may adversely affect our business and financial condition. 

We are responsible for the design, construction, installation, and maintenance of our water treatment, reclamation, and distribution systems. We could be adversely affected by a failure to complete our construction projects on time or on budget, and a substantial delay in the progress of construction due to adverse weather, work stoppages, shortages of materials or labor, non-issuances of permits, nonperformance of suppliers or contractors, or other factors could result in a material increase in the overall cost of such projects. 

We cannot guarantee that our systems will operate as designed or be free from defects. The failure of our systems to operate properly could cause significant public harm. Any defects in our systems or significant reliability, quality, or performance problems with respect to our systems or service could have a number of negative effects on our profitability, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows, including: 

&#8226; loss of revenue; 

&#8226; diversion of management and development resources and the attention of engineering personnel; 

&#8226; significant customer relations problems; 

&#8226; increased repair, support, and insurance expenses; 

&#8226; adverse regulatory actions; and 

&#8226; legal actions for damages by our customers, including but not limited to damages based on commercial losses and effects on human health. 

Operating costs, construction costs and costs of providing service can be volatile and may rise faster than revenue. 

Our ability to increase rates over time is dependent upon approval of rate increases by the ACC, which may be inclined, for political or other reasons, to limit rate increases. However, our costs are subject to market conditions and other factors, and may increase significantly. For example, costs for chemicals used to treat water and wastewater, as well as costs for power used to operate pumps and other equipment, can be volatile. See &#8220;&#8212;Operational Factors&#8212;We depend on an adequate supply of electricity and chemicals for the delivery of our water, and an interruption in the supply of these inputs or increases in their prices could adversely affect our results of operations.&#8221; 

Additionally, the second largest component of our operating costs after water production is made up of salaries and wages. These costs are affected by the local supply and demand for qualified labor. Other large components of our costs are general insurance, workers&#8217; compensation insurance, employee benefits and health insurance costs. These costs may increase disproportionately to rate increases authorized by utility regulators and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

Climate variability may cause increased volatility in weather and may impact water usage and related revenue or require additional expenditures, all of which may not be fully recoverable in rates or otherwise. 

The issue of climate variability is receiving increasing attention nationally and worldwide. There is consensus among climate scientists that there will be worsening of weather volatility in the future associated with climate variability. Many climate variability predictions present several potential challenges to water and wastewater utilities, including us, such as: 

&#8226; increased frequency and duration of droughts; 

&#8226; challenges associated with changes in temperature or increases in ocean levels; 

&#8226; potential degradation of water quality; 

&#8226; decreases in available water supply and changes in water usage patterns; 

&#8226; increased precipitation and flooding; 

&#8226; increased frequency and severity of storms and other weather events; 

&#8226; increases in disruptions in service; 

&#8226; increased costs to repair damaged facilities; or 

&#8226; increased costs to reduce risks associated with the increasing frequency and severity of natural events, including to improve the resiliency and reliability of our water and wastewater treatment and conveyance facilities and systems. 

Because of the uncertainty of weather volatility related to climate variability, we cannot predict its potential impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Furthermore, laws and regulations have been enacted that seek to reduce or limit greenhouse gas emissions and require additional reporting and monitoring, and these regulations may become more pervasive or stringent in light of changing governmental agendas and priorities, although the exact nature and timing of these changes is uncertain. There can be no assurance that we would be able to recover any expenditures or costs associated with the impact of climate variability and related laws and regulations on a timely basis, or at all, for our regulated utilities through the rate setting process. 

We may have difficulty recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, and due to the technical and specialized nature of our business, our profitability may suffer if we do not have the necessary workforce. 

Our operating utilities require some of our employees to be certified operators of record, a designation requiring specialized training and certification in water and wastewater systems. As workers with these qualifications retire in the industry, we may be unable to replace them readily in view of the relatively low number of younger workers that we believe are entering the workforce to pursue this line of work. Our operations require a variety of other technical skills and specialties in the areas of engineering, systems analysis, laboratory work and equipment repair, and we may have difficulty recruiting and retaining personnel with these skills. If we cannot maintain an employee base with the skills necessary to conduct our operations, our efficiency, margins and ability to expand our business could be adversely affected. 

Contamination of the water supplied by us may result in disruption in our service, loss of credibility, lower demand for our service and potential liability that could adversely affect our business and financial condition. 

Our water supplies are subject to contamination, including contamination from compounds, chemicals in groundwater systems, pollution resulting from man-made sources (such as perchlorate and methyl tertiary butyl ether) and possible biological terrorist attacks. Contamination of water sources can lead to human death and illness, damage to natural resources and other parts of the environment and cause other harms. Among other things, if we are found to be liable for consequences of water contamination arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other damage, we would be subject to civil or criminal enforcement actions, litigation and other proceedings or clean up obligations. Further, our insurance policies may not apply or be sufficient to cover the costs of these claims, which could be significant. 

Cleaning up water sources can be very expensive and if we are required to do so, it could have a material and adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. In the event that our water supply is contaminated, we may have to 

interrupt or stop the use of that water supply until we are able to treat the water or to substitute the supply of water from another water source, including, in some cases, through the purchase of water from a supplier. We may incur significant costs in order to warn consumers and to treat the contaminated source through expansion of current treatment facilities or development of new treatment methods. Using a new water source is generally associated with increased costs compared to an existing water source and, as indicated above, purchasing water is typically more expensive than obtaining the water from other means. If we are unable to treat or substitute our water supply in a cost-effective manner, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and reputation may be adversely affected. We may not be able to recover costs associated with treating contaminated water or developing new sources of supply through the rate setting process or through insurance. 

Our operations of regulated utilities are currently located exclusively in the state of Arizona, and more specifically approximately 86.1% of our active service connections are within a single municipality, which increases the impact of local conditions on our results of operations. 

The customers of our regulated utilities are currently located exclusively in the state of Arizona and 86.1% of our active service connections are located in the City of Maricopa, Arizona. As a result, we cannot diversify or mitigate the risks presented by local regulatory, economic, political, demographic and weather conditions in this area. An adverse change in any of these conditions would therefore affect our profitability, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows more significantly than if our utilities operated more broadly in other geographic areas. 

We depend on an adequate supply of electricity and chemicals for the delivery of our water, and an interruption in the supply of these inputs or increases in their prices could adversely affect our results of operations. 

We rely on purchased electrical power to operate the wells and pumps that are needed in order to supply potable and recycled water to our customers. An extended interruption in power supply that we cannot remediate through the use of backup generators could adversely affect our ability to continue these operations. Electrical power costs are beyond our control and can increase unpredictably and in substantial amounts. Under these circumstances, our cash flows between our general rate case filings and our earnings may be adversely affected until the ACC has authorized a rate increase. 

In addition, we require bulk supplies of chemicals for water and wastewater treatment, and if we were to suffer an interruption of supply that we cannot replace quickly, we might not be able to perform these functions adequately. Supply chain constraints may result in increased costs of supplies, products and materials that are critical to or used in the Company&#8217;s business operations. Also, some chemicals are available from a single source or a limited number of sources. There is no assurance that these suppliers will continue to produce the chemicals in the quantities and quality and at the times they are needed. Moreover, the replacement of any of these suppliers could lead to significant delays and increase in our costs. 

Our utilities business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and other weather-related conditions, such as droughts, which could adversely affect the supply of and demand for our service and our results of operations. 

We depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future needs of our customers. Whether we have an adequate water supply depends upon a variety of factors, including underground water supply from which groundwater is pumped, the rate at which it is recharged by rainfall and snowpack and changes in the amount of water used by our customers. In particular, the arid western U.S. region, which includes our present and potential service areas, has been required to deal with general conditions of water scarcity exacerbated by extended periods of drought. 

Drought conditions could interfere with our sources of water supply and could adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our existing and future customers. Any future interruption to our water supply or restrictions on water usage during drought conditions or other legal limitations on water use could result in decreased customer billing and lower revenue or higher expenses that we would not be able to recoup without prior regulatory approval for a rate increase, which may not be granted. These conditions could also lead to increases in capital expenditures needed to build infrastructure to secure alternative water sources. Furthermore, customers may use less water even after a drought has ended because of conservation patterns developed during the drought. Population growth could also decline under drought conditions as individuals and businesses move out of the area or elect not to relocate to our service areas. Lower water use for any reason could lead to lower revenue. 

Demand for water is seasonal and varies with temperature and rainfall levels. If temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal, or if there is more rainfall than normal, the demand for our water may decrease, which would adversely affect our profitability, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. Consequently, the results of operations for one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for future quarters or the full year. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Factors Affecting our Results of Operations&#8212;Weather and Seasonality,&#8221; included in Part II, Item 7 of this report, for additional information. 

If future acquisitions do not achieve sufficient profitability relative to expenses and investment, our business and ability to finance our operations could be materially adversely affected. 

A typical element of a utility growth strategy is the acquisition or development of other water and wastewater utilities. The potential negotiation of future acquisitions and development of new projects could require us to incur significant costs and expose us to significant risks, including: 

&#8226; risks relating to the condition of assets acquired and exposure to residual liabilities of prior businesses; 

&#8226; operating risks, including equipment, technology and supply problems, failure to achieve expected synergies and operating efficiencies, regulatory requirements and approvals necessary for acquisitions; 

&#8226; risks that potential acquisitions may require the disproportionate attention of our senior management, which could distract them from the management of our existing business; 

&#8226; risks related to our ability to retain experienced personnel of the acquired company; and 

&#8226; risks that certain acquisitions may require regulatory approvals, which could be refused or delayed and which could result in unforeseen regulatory expenses or unfavorable regulatory conditions. 

These issues could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to finance our operations. The businesses and other assets we acquire in the future may not achieve sufficient revenue or profitability to justify our investment, and any difficulties we may encounter in the integration process could interfere with our operations, reduce operating margins, and divert management&#8217;s attention. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuance of our equity securities, incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and fluctuations in quarterly results and expenses. 

The nature of our business exposes us to various liability claims, which may exceed the level of our insurance coverage and thereby not be reimbursed fully by insurance proceeds, or not be covered by our insurance at all, and may also make it difficult for us to obtain insurance coverage at affordable rates. 

In recent years, societal factors have resulted in increased litigation and escalating monetary claims against industries and employers. Although the national insurance market currently provides insurance coverage at affordable premiums, there is no guarantee this will continue or that we will continue to be able to obtain coverage against catastrophic claims and losses. While we may self-insure for some risks in the future, should an uninsured or underinsured loss occur, we may be unable to meet our obligations as they become due. 

The operation of our utilities is subject to the normal risks of occupancy as well as the additional risks of receiving, processing, treating and disposing of water and waste materials. As a safeguard, we currently maintain general liability and workers&#8217; compensation insurance coverage, subject to deductibles at levels we believe are sufficient to cover future claims made during the respective policy periods. However, we may be exposed to multiple claims, including workers&#8217; compensation claims, that do not exceed our deductibles, and, as a result, we could incur significant out-of-pocket costs that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the cost of insurance policies may increase significantly upon renewal of those policies as a result of general rate increases for the type of insurance we carry as well as our historical experience and experience in our industry. Our future claims may exceed the coverage level of our insurance, and insurance may not continue to be available on economically reasonable terms, or at all. If we are required to pay significantly higher premiums for insurance, are not able to maintain insurance coverage at affordable rates, or if we must pay amounts in excess of claims covered by our insurance, we could experience higher costs that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Any failure of our network of treatment facilities, water and wastewater pipes and water reservoirs could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation. 

Our utilities distribute water and collect wastewater through an extensive network of pipes and store water in reservoirs located across our service areas. A failure of major pipes or reservoirs could result in injuries and property damage for which we may be liable. The failure of major pipes and reservoirs may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our network in order to conduct repairs. Any failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to customers and to meet the water and wastewater delivery requirements prescribed by applicable utility regulators, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and reputation. 

We may have difficulty accomplishing our growth strategy within and outside of our current service areas. This would cause us to rely more heavily on regulatory rate increases to increase our revenue. 

Our ability to expand our business, both within our current service areas and into new areas, involves significant risks, including, but not limited to: 

&#8226; not receiving or maintaining necessary regulatory permits, licenses or approvals; 

&#8226; downturns in economic or population growth and development in our service areas; 

&#8226; risks related to planning and commencing new operations, including inaccurate assessment of the demand for water, engineering and construction difficulties and inability to begin operations as scheduled; 

&#8226; droughts or water shortages that could increase water conservation efforts to a point that materially reduces revenue; 

&#8226; regulatory restrictions or other factors that could adversely affect our access to sources of water supply; 

&#8226; our potential inability to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or to form the relationships with developers and municipalities necessary to form strategic partnerships; and 

&#8226; barriers to entry presented by existing water utilities in prospective service areas. 

If we are unable to execute our growth strategy effectively, we will need to rely more heavily on regulatory rate increases to increase our revenue. However, there can be no assurance that the regulatory authorities will approve any rate increases. 

Risks associated with the collection, treatment and disposal of wastewater and the operation of water utilities may impose significant costs that may not be covered by insurance, which could result in increased insurance premiums. 

The wastewater collection, treatment and disposal operations of our utilities are subject to substantial regulation and involve significant environmental risks. If collection or sewage systems fail, overflow or do not operate properly, untreated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers, potentially causing damage to persons or property, injury to the environment including aquatic life and economic damages, which may not be recoverable in rates. This risk is most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding, which are the main causes of sewer overflow and system failure. Liabilities resulting from such damage could adversely and materially affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, in the event that we are deemed liable for any damage caused by overflow, losses might not be covered by insurance policies, and such losses may make it difficult to secure insurance in the future at acceptable insurance premium rates. Similarly, any related business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies, which would also make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable insurance premium rates. 

We may also incur liabilities under environmental laws and regulations requiring investigations and cleanup of environmental contamination at our properties or at off-site locations where there have been adverse environmental impacts. The discovery of previously unknown conditions, or the imposition of cleanup obligations in the future, could result in significant costs, and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Such remediation losses may not be covered by insurance policies and may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable insurance premium rates. 

We are subject to industrial risks that could adversely affect our results of operations. 

The operations of our water and wastewater treatment plants involve physical, chemical and biological processes and the use of pumps, generators and other industrial equipment. As a result, our operations are subject to various industrial risks, including chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases, effects resulting from confined operating spaces, fires, explosions, mechanical failures, storage tank leaks and electric shock. These risks can result in personal injury, loss of life, catastrophic damage to or destruction of property and equipment or environmental damage and related legal proceedings, including those commenced by regulators, neighbors or others. They may also result in an unanticipated interruption or suspension of our operations and the imposition of liability. The loss or shutdown over an extended period of operations at any of our treatment facilities or any losses relating to these risks could have a material adverse impact on our profitability, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. 

We face competition for new service areas and acquisition targets. 

We face competition from other water and wastewater utilities for new service areas and with respect to acquisitions of smaller utilities. These competitors consist primarily of municipalities and investor-owned utilities seeking expansion opportunities. Some of our competitors are larger than we are and have more resources and access to capital than we do. If we are unable to 

compete effectively for new service areas and acquisitions of existing utilities, our ability to increase our rate base and revenue could be adversely affected. 

Service interruptions, including due to any disruption or problem at our facilities could increase our expenses. 

A natural disaster (such as an earthquake, fire or flood) or an act of terrorism could cause substantial delays in our operations, damage or destroy our equipment or facilities and cause us to incur additional expenses and lose revenue. The insurance we maintain against natural disasters may not be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case, which would require us to expend significant resources to replace any destroyed assets, thereby materially and adversely affecting our financial condition and prospects. 

Other global incidents, such as a pandemic or other public health crisis, could have a similar effect of disrupting our business to the extent they reach and impact the service areas in which we operate, the availability of supplies we need, the customers we serve, or the employees who operate our businesses. See &#8220;&#8212;Business and Operational Factors &#8212; Pandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our business operations, cash flows and financial position to an extent that is difficult to predict&#8221; for additional information. 

We are subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks, which make us vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatory oversight or other sanctions. 

Water and wastewater utilities, including GW-Palo Verde and GW-Santa Cruz, have large customer bases and as a result are exposed to public criticism regarding, among other things, the reliability of their water and wastewater service, the quality of water provided, the timeliness and accuracy of bills that are provided for such service and the quality of customer service. Adverse publicity and negative customer sentiment may render regulators and government officials less likely to view us in a favorable light, and may cause us to be susceptible to less favorable regulatory outcomes, as well as increased regulatory oversight, lower rates and more stringent regulatory requirements. Unfavorable regulatory outcomes may include the enactment of more stringent laws and regulations governing our operations, as well as fines, penalties or other sanctions or requirements. The imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

Pandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our business operations, cash flows and financial position to an extent that is difficult to predict. 

The occurrence of pandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our business operations, cash flows and financial position. These impacts may include, among others, disruptions to our operations and business activities, including any closures of offices or facilities, and to those of governmental agencies regulating our business, suppliers, customers and other business partners; reduced demand for our water and wastewater service from our commercial customers, particularly if businesses are shut down; greater difficulty in collecting customer receivables; a slowdown or disruption in the supply chain for the supplies used in our operations, including chemicals used to treat water and wastewater, in addition to higher costs; and limitations on employee resources, productivity and availability, including due to sickness, government restrictions, labor supply shortages and the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people. There would be many variables and uncertainties associated with any future pandemics, epidemics or disease outbreaks, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the outbreak; the extent of travel restrictions, business closures and other measures imposed by governmental authorities; availability of vaccines; and other factors that may be currently unknown or considered immaterial, to fully assess the potential impact on our business operations, cash flows and financial position. 

Doing business in jurisdictions other than Arizona may present unforeseen regulatory, legal and operational challenges that could impede or delay our operations or adversely affect our profitability. 

We may decide to pursue growth opportunities in states other than Arizona. Other states may present substantially different regulatory frameworks, and we may have difficulty acquiring the necessary approvals and permits or complying with environmental, health and safety or quality standards. In addition, it may become more costly or difficult for us to comply with a multitude of standards and requirements across multiple states. 

Other states may also expose us to new legal precedents, condemnation risks and liability concerns based on state legislation or case law. 

Our cost structure in other states may be significantly different than our current cost structure due to regional differences. For example, our cost structure may be significantly impacted by differences in labor and energy costs in other markets and the significant portion of overall production costs that they represent. 

If the general public perceives recycled water to be unsafe, we will have difficulty executing our business plan and could face a loss of revenue. 

Our Total Water Management model emphasizes the maximum use of recycled water for non-potable purposes. To implement this model, we cultivate relationships with developers, municipalities and members of the communities we serve and focus on educating them regarding the benefits and safety of recycled water. If the recycled water supplied to customers is contaminated, either as a result of terrorism, system failure, pipeline or other causes, public perception regarding the safety of recycled water would likely suffer, regardless of whether we are at fault and potentially even if the contaminated water was supplied by another person. Public perception of an unsafe water supply would harm our business, particularly with respect to our ability to implement water recycling as a key element of our business strategy. 

Technology Factors 

Our information technology systems may be vulnerable to unauthorized external or internal threats due to hacking, ransomware, viruses or other cybersecurity breaches. 

In the regular course of our business, the Company manages a range of sensitive security, customer and business systems information. A security breach of our information systems, such as theft or the inappropriate release of certain types of information, including confidential customer, employee, financial or system operating information, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The Company operates in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite implementation of security measures, the technology systems are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access. Facilities, information technology systems and other infrastructure facilities and systems and physical assets could be targets of such unauthorized access. Failures or breaches of our systems could impact the reliability of systems and also subject the Company to financial harm. If the technology systems were to fail or be breached, and if the Company is unable to recover in a timely way, the Company&#8217;s ability to fulfill critical business functions and manage sensitive confidential data could be compromised, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

The Company has experienced, and expects to continue experiencing, these types of threats and attempted intrusions. The implementation of additional security measures could increase costs and have a material adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s financial results. Cyber insurance has been obtained to provide coverage for a portion of the losses and damages that may result from a security breach of information technology systems, but such insurance may not cover the total loss or damage caused by a breach. In addition, all costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident may not be covered by insurance. These types of events could also require significant management attention and resources, and could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s reputation with customers and the public. 

As operators of critical infrastructure, we may face a heightened risk of cyberattacks from internal or external sources. For example, a hacker accessed a Florida water treatment plant&#8217;s control system and attempted to increase the amount of lye used to treat the water to a potentially dangerous level. Unauthorized access to confidential information located or stored on these systems could negatively and materially impact our customers, employees, suppliers and other third parties. Further, third parties, including vendors, suppliers and contractors, who perform certain services for us or administer and maintain our sensitive information, could also be targets of cyberattacks and unauthorized access. While we have instituted safeguards to protect our information technology systems, those safeguards may not always be effective due to the evolving nature of cyberattacks and cyber vulnerabilities. We cannot guarantee that such protections will be completely successful in the event of a cyberattack. 

If our information technology systems, or that of third parties on which we rely on, are affected by a significant cyber breach, this could result in, among other things, a significant disruption to our operations; costly investigations and remediation; misappropriation of confidential information of the Company or that of our customers, employees, business partners or others; litigation and potential liability; enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities; loss of customers and contracts; harm to our reputation; and a loss of management time, attention and resources from our regular business operations, any of which could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows. These types of events, either impacting our facilities or the industry in general, could also cause us to incur additional security and insurance related costs. 

Our cyber insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may not cover the total loss or damage caused by a breach. In addition, the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident may not be covered by insurance. 

We rely on information technology systems to assist with the management of our business and customer relationships. A disruption or interruption of these systems could adversely affect our business and operations. 

Our information technology systems, which include information technology functions that are outsourced to various third-party service providers and software vendors, are an integral part of our business. For example, our information technology systems allow us, among other things, to bill our customers, provide customer service through our call center, manage certain financial records, track assets and accounts receivable collections, read water meters remotely, identify high water usage and identify water theft from disconnected meters. A disruption of our information technology systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently, which in turn could cause our business to suffer and negatively impact our results of operations. 

Further, our information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from: 

&#8226; power loss, computer systems failures and internet, telecommunications or data network failures; 

&#8226; operator negligence or improper operation by, or supervision of, employees; 

&#8226; physical and electronic loss of customer data, including as a result of or security breaches, cyberattacks, misappropriation and similar events; 

&#8226; computer viruses; 

&#8226; intentional acts of vandalism and similar events; and 

&#8226; fires, floods, earthquakes and other natural disasters. 

Damages or interruptions due to any of the foregoing could result in, among other things, difficulties managing and operating our business efficiently, such as with the timely issuances of billings, physical and electronic loss of customer, employee or financial data, security breaches, misappropriation of property and other adverse consequences. The lack of redundancy for some of our information technology systems, including billing systems, could exacerbate the impact of any of the foregoing events. Additionally, we may not be successful in further developing, implementing or acquiring technology to enable us to continue to operate at our current level of efficiency or to meet the future needs of our business. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

Maintaining our operational technology and information technology systems or implementing new systems could result in higher than expected costs or otherwise adversely impact our internal controls environment, operations and profitability. 

Upgrades and improvements to computer systems and networks, or the implementation of new systems, may require substantial amounts of management&#8217;s time and financial resources to complete, and may also result in system or network defects or operational errors due to multiple factors, including the inability of employees to effectively use such new or upgraded systems. While we continue to implement technology to improve our business processes and customer interactions, any technical or other difficulties in transitioning, upgrading or improving existing or implementing new technology systems may increase costs beyond those anticipated and have an adverse or disruptive effect on our operations and reporting processes, including our internal control over financial reporting. We may also experience difficulties integrating current systems with new or upgraded systems, which may impact our ability to serve our customers effectively or efficiently. Although we make efforts to minimize any adverse impact on our controls, business and operations, we cannot assure that all such impacts have been or will be mitigated, and any such impacts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

We rely on telecommunications vendors for communication between our sites and to enable centralized management of Information and Operation Technologies. Disruption of those communication systems may adversely affect our results of operations. 

The centralized management of information and operation technologies rely on functions that are provided by third-party providers and are an integral part of our business. A disruption of those communication systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently, which in turn could cause our business to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations. 

Market and Financial Factors 

We will need additional capital to grow our business, and additional financing may not be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. 

Adequate funds to support our growth may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us. We may need to raise additional funds to support more rapid expansion, improve our facilities and infrastructure, develop new and enhanced technologies or respond to evolving regulatory standards. We may experience difficulty in raising the necessary capital due to volatility in the capital markets or increases in the cost of infrastructure finance. In addition, we require regulatory approval from the ACC for some means of raising capital, such as issuance of debt by our regulated utilities, and approval may be denied or delayed. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of expansion opportunities, make the capital expenditures necessary to support our growth or otherwise execute our strategic plan. 

Our growth depends significantly on increased residential and commercial development in our service areas, and if developers or builders are unable to complete additional residential and commercial projects, our revenue may not increase. 

The growth of our customer base depends almost entirely on the success of developers in developing residential and commercial properties within our CC&#38;N areas. A CC&#38;N is a permit issued by the ACC allowing a public service corporation to serve a specified area, and preventing other public service corporations from offering the same service within the specified area, which we refer to as &#8220;service areas.&#8221; Moreover, real estate development is a cyclical industry. For example, the growth rate of development, especially residential development, from 2006 through 2019, both nationally and in Arizona, was below historical rates. 

The single-family housing market is affected by a number of national and regional economic factors, including: 

&#8226; interest rates and general levels of economic output; 

&#8226; levels of activity in the local real estate market; 

&#8226; the state of domestic credit markets, mortgage standards and availability of credit; 

&#8226; competition from other builders and other projects in the area and other states; 

&#8226; federal programs to assist home purchasers; 

&#8226; costs and availability of labor and materials; 

&#8226; government regulations affecting land development, home building and mortgage financing; 

&#8226; availability of financing for development and for home purchasers; 

&#8226; changes in the income tax treatment relating to real property ownership; 

&#8226; unexpected increases in development costs; 

&#8226; increased commute times and fuel costs that may adversely affect the desirability of outlying suburbs; 

&#8226; availability of, among other things, other utilities, adequate transportation and school facilities; and 

&#8226; environmental problems with such land. 

While many developers presently hold necessary zoning approvals, land development within our service areas could also be affected by changes in governmental policies, including, but not limited to, governmental policies to restrict or control development. This may include, for example, actions by the local school districts to restrict admissions to local schools because of inadequate classroom space or, because of other problems, such as failure by local municipalities to approve plats for the development. An increase in current residential foreclosure rates or a deep or prolonged slowdown of the development process and the related absorption rate within the various developments in our service areas because of any or all of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect growth of our customer base and the generation of revenue. 

Many national builders and developers in our service areas own or control substantial amounts of the developable land in these areas. There can be no assurance that these builders and developers have the financial capability to continue and complete their developments. 

Foreclosure rates in our service areas, as well as other factors affecting real estate development, could affect the growth of our regulated customer base or result in a decline in our revenue. 

A slowdown or severe downturn in the housing market could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. During periods of economic distress, there may be an increase in home foreclosures and vacancies. For example, during the economic downturn beginning in 2008, our utilities experienced an increase in the number of vacant homes, reaching a peak of 4,020 vacant connections as of February 28, 2009, approximately 11.9% of our total connections at the time. Accordingly, in the event of an economic downturn, we may experience a material reduction in revenue. Although the U.S. economy and housing market continue to perform well, we cannot predict the overall trajectory of the market. Our growth depends significantly on increased residential and commercial development in our service areas, and if developers or builders are unable to complete additional residential and commercial projects, our revenue may decline. 

Our existing indebtedness could affect our business adversely and limit our ability to plan for or respond to growth opportunities, and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our liquidity needs. 

As of December 31, 2024, we had total indebtedness of $122.4 million . In addition, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Our indebtedness could have important consequences, including: 

&#8226; limiting our ability to obtain future additional financing we may need to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other corporate requirements; and 

&#8226; limiting, by the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt agreements, our ability to borrow additional funds and to pay dividends. 

Our ability to incur significant future indebtedness will depend in part on our ability to generate cash flow. This ability is affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if we are unable to borrow money or otherwise generate funds sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, we may be unable to plan for or respond to growth opportunities, which could adversely affect our operating results and business prospects. 

Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock 

The concentration of our stock ownership with our officers, directors, certain stockholders and their affiliates may limit your ability to influence corporate matters. 

Our directors, executive officers and stockholders holding more than 5% of our capital stock and their affiliates beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 53% of our outstanding common stock, including 42.4% beneficially owned in the aggregate by our former director, William S. Levine, and current director Jonathan L. Levine. As a result, these stockholders are able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of us or our assets. This concentration of ownership could limit your ability to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over us. There can be no assurance that their interests will not conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. 

Our common stock may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above your purchase price. 

The market price for our common stock is likely to be volatile, due to many factors, outside our control, including those described elsewhere in this &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section, as well as the following: 

&#8226; our operating and financial performance and prospects; 

&#8226; our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry compared to market expectations; 

&#8226; conditions that impact demand for our service; 

&#8226; future announcements concerning our business or our competitors&#8217; businesses; 

&#8226; regulatory developments, including those related to the ACC; 

&#8226; the public&#8217;s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC; 

&#8226; the size of our public float; 

&#8226; coverage by or changes in financial estimates by investment analysts or failure to meet their expectations; 

&#8226; the market&#8217;s perception towards our reduced disclosure as a result of being a &#8220;smaller reporting company&#8221; as defined in the Exchange Act; 

&#8226; market and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy; 

&#8226; strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings; 

&#8226; changes in laws or regulations which adversely affect our industry or us; 

&#8226; changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; 

&#8226; changes in senior management or key personnel; 

&#8226; issuances, exchanges or sales, or expected issuances, exchanges or sales of our capital stock; 

&#8226; changes in our dividend policy; 

&#8226; adverse resolution of new or pending litigation against us; and 

&#8226; changes in general market, economic and political conditions in the U.S., and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural disasters, terrorist attacks, acts of war (including the ongoing wars and conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Hamas), other geopolitical uncertainties, public health concerns and responses to such events. 

In addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies in our industry. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs, and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business. 

We cannot assure you that we will pay dividends on our common stock, and our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. 

We currently intend to continue to pay a regular monthly dividend on our common stock of $0.02533 per share ($0.30396 per share annually). However, our future dividend policy is subject to our compliance with applicable law, and is dependent on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, level of indebtedness, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions in our debt agreements and on the terms of any preferred stock we may issue in the future, business prospects and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Dividend payments are not mandatory or guaranteed; there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay a dividend in the future. 

Our failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as a public company could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price. 

We are required to comply with Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the &#8220;Sarbanes-Oxley Act&#8221;). Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Additionally, once we are no longer deemed a smaller reporting company that is a non-accelerated filer, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. The rules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing, and possible remediation. 

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We may encounter problems or delays for any requested improvements and receiving a favorable attestation in connection with the attestation to be provided by our independent registered public accounting firm after we cease to be a smaller reporting company that is a non-accelerated filer. If our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on our internal controls after we cease to be a smaller reporting company that is a non-accelerated filer, investors could lose confidence in our financial information and the price of our common stock could decline. 

Additionally, the existence of any material weakness or significant deficiency would require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weakness or significant deficiency and management may not be able to remediate any such material weakness or significant deficiency in a timely manner. The existence of any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, and cause stockholders to lose 

confidence in our reported financial information, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business and share price. 

Taking advantage of the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors. 

We are a &#8220;smaller reporting company&#8221; as defined in the Exchange Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies including, but not limited to, (i) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (so long as we also remain a non-accelerated filer); (ii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and (iii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding financial statements. 

We may take advantage of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies for so long as our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenue is less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter. 

We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result of our taking advantage of these exemptions and as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. 

Delaware law, certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and regulations of the ACC may prevent efforts by our stockholders to change the direction or management of the Company. 

We are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including, but not limited to, the following: 

&#8226; only allowing our board of directors, Chairman of our board of directors, Chief Executive Officer or President to call special meetings of our stockholders; 

&#8226; setting forth specific procedures regarding how our stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings; 

&#8226; requiring advance notice and duration of ownership requirements for stockholder proposals; 

&#8226; permitting our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval; and 

&#8226; limiting the rights of stockholders to amend our bylaws. 

These provisions could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you desire. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team. 

Additionally, the ACC must determine that certain types of transactions will not impair our financial status, prevent us from attracting capital at fair and reasonable terms or impair our ability to provide safe, reasonable and adequate service. Pursuant to this regulatory mandate, the ACC may impose conditions that could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

In addition to information discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial, which could materially affect our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations in future periods. 

Risks Relating to Our Operations 

Our dependence upon outside suppliers for component parts, chassis and raw materials, including aluminum, steel, and petroleum-related products, leaves us subject to changes in price and availability, the cadence and quantity of deliveries from our suppliers, and delays in receiving supplies of such materials, component parts or chassis. 

We are dependent upon outside suppliers for our raw material needs, other purchased component parts, and chassis. Prices, availability and the timing of delivery of these raw materials, purchased component parts, and chassis are subject to substantial fluctuations that are beyond our control due to factors such as changing economic conditions, the level of tariffs that the U.S. impose on imported steel, aluminum, and other commodities or component parts and any resulting trade wars or trade restrictions, inflation, governmental regulations (including CARB&#8217;s Advanced Clean Trucks regulation), currency and commodity price fluctuations, resource availability, transportation costs, weather conditions and natural disasters, political unrest and instability, war (such as the ongoing military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East) and other factors impacting supply and demand pressures. Sporadic deliveries, significantly elevated delivery quantities, and delays in shipments of our raw materials, purchased component parts, including chassis, and government actions related to tariffs on imports and trade policies have previously adversely impacted, and have the potential to further impact our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.

As a result of our supply chain challenges, it has become more difficult to accurately forecast, purchase, warehouse, and transport to our manufacturing facilities and to our distribution partners purchased materials, component parts, and chassis at optimal volumes. If we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of component purchases, including chassis, to our actual needs or successfully manage our inventory or our workforce to adapt to the increased complexity in our supply chain, we may incur unexpected inventory buildup in our distribution channel. A mismatch in the timing and quantities of component purchases, including with respect to chassis, that results in a significant inventory buildup in our distribution channel has resulted, and could continue to result, in reduced sales, as our distribution partners work through any such inventory buildup in the field. In addition, if we experience shortages or delays in receiving raw materials, component parts, and chassis, we may also incur unexpected production disruption, as well as storage, transportation, and labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may not be able to meet our customers&#8217; delivery schedules and could face the loss of orders or customers as a result of any resulting production disruptions. 

Our third-party suppliers&#8217; ability to supply us with component parts and chassis is limited by their available capacity to manufacture the component parts and chassis we require, and to secure adequate freight capacity to deliver them to our facilities. Various supply chain disruptions in 2024 continued to impact our ability to obtain certain raw materials, purchased component parts and chassis from third party suppliers resulted in substantial price increases. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2023 and during 2024, we and, in turn, our distribution partners, also experienced significantly elevated levels of chassis shipments earlier than expected that resulted in a buildup of inventory in our distribution channel during the first half of 2024. While we slowed chassis deliveries in the second half of 2024 to allow our distributor network to work through the inventory already in the distribution channel, we continued to experience such difficulties throughout 2024 and in early 2025. These supply chain difficulties have had, and are anticipated to continue to have, a material adverse impact on our profitability and results of operations. 

Delays in deliveries of our finished products due to delays of purchased component parts and chassis used in our products could also adversely affect future demand for our products if our customers reduce their purchase levels with us and/or seek alternative solutions to meet their demand. If these delays, limitations on availability and price increases for raw materials, purchased component parts, and chassis continue, recur or worsen, they will continue to have a material adverse effect on production at our facilities.

Recently, the U.S. announced the implementation of new or increased tariffs, including tariffs on steel and aluminum products imported from various countries. The ultimate impact of these tariffs is unknown at this time. Additionally, ongoing changes in U.S. and foreign government trade policies, including potential modifications to existing trade agreements and further restrictions on free trade, could introduce additional uncertainty. Any escalation of trade tensions, additional tariffs, retaliatory measures by foreign governments, or shifts in U.S. or international trade policies could adversely impact our supply chain and increase costs of component parts, chassis and raw materials, such as steel, aluminum, and petroleum-related products. A trade war or other significant changes in trade regulations could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We also continue to monitor the impact of the conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East on our fuel costs and supply chain for materials and component parts, particularly with respect to steel and items with substantial steel content.

Shortages and price increases and/or delays or unexpected cadence or quantities in the deliveries of, our raw materials and purchased component parts, including chassis, have had and should be anticipated to continue to have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial performance, competitive position and reputation.

Demand from our customers and towing operators is affected by the availability of capital and access to credit, as well as rising costs of equipment ownership.

The ability of our customers and of towing operators to purchase our products is affected by the availability of capital and credit to them. Our independent distributor customers rely on floor plan financing in connection with the purchase of our products, and the availability of that financing on acceptable terms has a direct effect on the volume of their purchases. More restrictive lending practices in conjunction with continuing increases in the cost of such financing can prevent distributors from carrying adequate levels of inventory, which limits product offerings available to the end customer and could lead to reduced sales of our products. Additionally, in many cases, a towing operator&#8217;s decision to purchase our products from one of our distributors is dependent upon their ability to obtain financing upon acceptable terms. Volatility in the capital markets and changing interest rates have increased the cost of borrowing for our customers and towing operators. In the past, such volatility and disruptions to the capital and credit markets, principally in the U.S. and Europe, in the past has decreased the availability of capital to, and credit capacity of, our customers and towing operators. In addition, in the past, certain providers of floor plan financing have exited the market, which made floor plan financing increasingly difficult for our independent distributor customers to secure at those times. This reduced availability of capital and credit has negatively affected the ability and capacity of our customers and of towing operators to purchase towing and related equipment. This, in turn, has negatively impacted sales of our products. If interest rates continue to rise and our customers are unable to access capital or credit, it could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our products, and as a result, could negatively affect our business and operating results.

In addition, the rising costs of equipment ownership have been, and could continue to be, a significant challenge for end-market users that could in the future impact customer demand for our products. For example, insurance premiums on our end users&#8217; trucks have increased, interest rates on new equipment have risen, and the value of used trucks has fluctuated, affecting trade-in values and new equipment purchases. These rising costs of equipment ownership continue to pressure our customers. Any continuation or worsening of the costs of equipment ownership could negatively impact customer demand for our products and have a material adverse impact on our profitability and results of operations.

Macroeconomic trends, availability of financing, and changing interest rates, have and could continue to, adversely affect our business, results of operation or financial condition, as well as our customers&#8217; ability to fund purchases of our products. 

Worldwide economic and political conditions and other factors, such as changes in trade policies and tariffs, restrictive monetary and fiscal policy, political instability, military hostilities (such as the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East), domestic and global inflationary trends, global supply shortages, interest rate volatility, and potential instability in the global banking system, have from time to time contributed to significant domestic and global inflation. For example, in 2022, the global economy experienced elevated levels of inflation. In response to higher than historical average inflationary pressures and challenging macroeconomic conditions, the U.S. Federal Reserve, along with other central banks, including in the U.K., maintained interest rates at elevated levels throughout 2023. In 2024, inflation began to return to historical norms, and, as a result, the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England lowered their interest rates by 100 and 50 basis points, respectively. The impact of the lowering of interest rates on the levels of inflation in the U.S., U.K. and Europe is uncertain. In Europe, rising energy costs as a result of supply disruptions and increased winter demand for heating could place strain on our operations and our suppliers&#8217; ability to maintain current production levels. Across the U.K. and Europe, rising energy costs as a result of supply disruptions could result in nations or regions enacting emergency energy related policies, limiting energy availability for our manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdom and France. The impact of these macroeconomic developments on our operations cannot be predicted with certainty. While we have attempted to pass increased costs on to our customers in the past, there can be no assurances that we will be able to continue doing so in the future. It is possible that sustained price increases, surcharges or price inflation (or inflation pressure generally), in turn, may lead to declines in volume, and while we seek to project tradeoffs between price increases, surcharges and inflation, on the one hand, and volume, on the other, there can be no assurance that our projections will prove to be accurate.

Furthermore, a decline of the United States&#8217; credit rating or a recession in global or regional economy could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and liquidity. Any potential inflation or further pressure on credit markets could also adversely affect our and our customers&#8217; ability to continue to access preferred sources of liquidity resulting in increased borrowing costs.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

##TABLE_END &#8203; 

Our business operations are subject to various international political, economic and other uncertainties, including any new or increased tariffs, any trade restrictions, or new or ongoing military conflicts, that could materially adversely affect our business results.

Historically, a portion of our net sales occur outside the United States, primarily in Europe. We also have manufacturing operations in Norfolk, England, and in the Lorraine region of France. As such, our operations are subject to various international political, economic and other uncertainties, including risks of restrictive taxation policies, changing political conditions and governmental regulations and trade policies, including tariffs and or trade restrictions. For example, in February 2025, the United States imposed additional tariffs on imports of Chinese-origin goods, as well as certain steel and aluminum imports from various countries. These additional tariffs, as well as a government&#8217;s adoption of &#8220;buy national&#8221; policies or retaliation by another government against such tariffs or policies may have introduced significant uncertainty into the market and may affect the prices of and supply of component parts, chassis and raw materials, including aluminum, steel, and petroleum-related products.

There remains uncertainty with regard to the ongoing military conflicts in Ukraine, in the Middle East, and their impact on European and worldwide economic and supply chain conditions. These continued conflicts have created and may continue to create legal, political and economic uncertainties and impacts, including disruptions to trade and free movement of goods, services and people to and from Europe, disruptions to our workforce or the workforce of our suppliers or business partners. All of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, a portion of our net sales derived outside the United States, as well as salaries of employees located outside the United States and certain other expenses, are denominated in foreign currencies, including the British pound sterling and the euro. We are, therefore, subject to risk of financial loss resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates of these currencies against the U.S. dollar. For example, the United Kingdom&#8217;s &#8220;Brexit&#8221; from the European Union has caused, and may continue to result in, significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies in which we conduct business, including both the British pound sterling and the euro. 

In addition, political unrest, terrorist acts, military conflict, including the ongoing military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, and disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have increased the risks of doing business abroad in general. 

Increases in the cost of skilled labor could adversely impact our business and profitability. 

The timely manufacture and delivery of our products requires an adequate supply of skilled labor, and the operating costs of our manufacturing facilities can be adversely affected by increasing labor costs in skilled positions. Accordingly, our ability to increase or maintain our current levels of sales, productivity and net earnings will be limited to a degree by our ability to control the costs of skilled laborers necessary to meet our requirements. We must attract, train and retain skilled employees while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values, including safety standards. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including the limited supply of available skilled labor for hire, prevailing wage rates, increases in healthcare and other enhanced employee benefits, in addition to cost increases associated with employee recruitment. 

The market for qualified talent continues to be competitive and we must ensure that we continue to offer competitive wages, benefits and workplace conditions to retain qualified employees. Since 2022, we have experienced substantial increases in employee wages in order to retain and recruit a talented workforce. This trend may continue over the near term, and possibly longer. We continue to monitor our labor costs and attempt to mitigate the risk associated with employee turnover through increased recruiting, training and retention efforts. The impact of these disruptions remains largely out of our control, and these factors may continue to have a material adverse impact on our profitability and results of operations. 

We invest significant time and expense in training our employees, which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them. If we fail to retain our employees, we could incur significant expenses in hiring and training their replacements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to efficiently operate our facilities. In addition, while our employees are not currently members of a union, there can be no assurance that the employees at any of our facilities will not choose to become unionized in the future.

Our business is subject to the cyclical nature of our industry and changes in consumer confidence and in economic conditions in general. Adverse changes or continued uncertainty with respect to these factors may lead to a downturn in our business. 

The towing and recovery industry is cyclical in nature. Historically, the overall demand for our products and our resulting revenues have at times been negatively affected by wavering levels of consumer confidence, volatility and disruption in domestic and international capital and credit markets and the resulting decrease in the availability of financing for our customers and towing operators and the overall effects of global economic conditions. We remain concerned about the potential effects of these factors on the towing and recovery industry, and we continue to monitor our overall cost structure to see that it remains in line with business conditions. A prolonged economic downturn, including as a result of political unrest, terrorist acts, military conflicts, weather events, outbreaks of disease, or other public health crises,

and slow or negative growth in the domestic and global economy, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations for the foreseeable future.

Our sales to U.S. and other governmental entities through prime contractors are subject to special risks.

We act as a subcontractor for certain U.S. and other government programs. As a result, we are subject to extensive regulations and requirements of the U.S. and other government agencies and entities that govern these programs, including with respect to the award, administration and performance of contracts under such programs. Our U.S. and other government business is subject to the following risks, among others: (i) this business is susceptible to decreases in government spending, which may reduce future revenues; (ii) most of our contracts with governmental entities through prime contractors are fixed-price contracts, and our actual costs on any of these contracts could exceed our projected costs, (iii) competition for the award of these contracts is intense, and we may not be successful in bidding on future contracts, and (iv) the products we sell to governmental entities are subject to highly technical requirements, and any failure to comply with these requirements could result in unanticipated retrofit costs, delayed acceptance of products, late or reduced payment or cancellation of the contract. Our inability to address any of the foregoing concerns could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Overall demand from our customers may be affected by increases in their fuel and insurance costs and changes in weather conditions.

In the past, our customers have experienced substantial increases in fuel and other transportation costs, and in the cost of insurance. Our customers also have, from time to time, been subject to unpredictable and varying weather conditions, such as hurricanes, which could, among other things, impact the cost and availability of fuel and other materials. In addition, the ongoing military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and market dislocations associated with global supply chain disruptions have both resulted in, and may continue to result in, substantial volatility in fuel costs in the U.S. and worldwide, and the extent and duration of such volatility cannot be predicted. Any of these factors could negatively affect our customers&#8217; capacity for purchasing towing and related equipment, and, consequently, have a material negative effect upon our business and operating results.

Our competitors could impede our ability to attract or retain customers.

The towing and recovery equipment manufacturing industry is highly competitive. Capital requirements for entry into the towing and recovery manufacturing industry have been relatively low, which could result in an increase in the number of competitors entering the industry. Competition for sales exists domestically and internationally at the manufacturer, distributor and towing-operator levels and is based primarily on product quality and innovation, reputation, technology, customer service, product availability and price. Competition for sales also comes from the market for used towing and recovery equipment. Certain of our competitors may have substantially greater financial and other resources and may provide more attractive dealer and retail customer financing alternatives than us. If these competitors are able to make it more difficult for us to attract or retain customers, it could have a negative impact on our sales, revenue and financial performance.

The catastrophic loss of one of our manufacturing facilities could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

While we manufacture our products in several facilities and maintain insurance covering our facilities, including business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss, a catastrophic loss of the use of all or a portion of any one of our manufacturing facilities due to accident, labor issues, weather conditions, natural disaster, civil unrest, terrorist acts, military conflict or disease outbreaks, or otherwise, whether short or long-term, could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations.

Risks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Matters 

Environmental and health and safety liabilities and requirements could require us to incur material costs. 

We are subject to various U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and worker health and safety, including those governing discharges of pollutants into the ground, air and water; the generation, handling, use, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials; and the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties. In certain cases, these regulatory requirements may limit the productive capacity of our operations. 

In addition, laws and regulations intended to achieve the goal of significantly reducing engine emissions associated with the operation of commercial vehicles are also being phased in by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state regulators. For example, the California Air Resources Board&#8217;s (&#8220;CARB&#8221;), Advanced Clean Trucks regulation, which has been adopted by several other states, requires manufacturers, including truck body chassis manufacturers that supply to us, to sell an increasing percentage of zero-emission or near zero-emission medium and heavy-duty trucks into the California market starting in calendar year 2024.

##TABLE_START PART I 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

##TABLE_END &#8203; 

CARB&#8217;s Advanced Clean Fleets regulation sets requirements for organizations to reduce the overall emissions of the vehicle fleets they operate, which affects our customers who own and operate fleets in California. These regulations are intended to drive larger market penetration of zero-emission commercial trucks. There are currently multiple efforts underway which seek to prevent or delay some or all of these regulations from taking effect or otherwise seek relief from CARB&#8217;s regulations. However, compliance with the regulations as currently written, or new or more stringent laws or regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws or regulations have negatively impacted customer demand during 2024 and early 2025, and are expected to continue to negatively impact customer demand, which has had, and could continue to have, a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

Environmental and health-related requirements are complex, subject to change and have tended to become more and more stringent. Future developments could cause us to incur various expenditures and could also subject us to fines or sanctions, obligations to investigate or remediate contamination or restore natural resources, liability for third-party property damage or personal injury claims and the imposition of new permitting requirements and/or the modification or revocation of our existing operating permits, among other effects. These and other developments could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our facilities and operations could in the future be subject to regulations related to climate change and climate change (or events caused by climate change) may also have some impact on the Company&#8217;s operations. However, these impacts are currently uncertain, and the Company cannot presently predict the nature and scope of those impacts.

Failure to comply with domestic and foreign anti-corruption laws could have an adverse effect on our business.

Our domestic and international operations require us to comply with a number of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those involving anti-bribery and anti-corruption. Failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other foreign anti-bribery laws could have an adverse effect on our business. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in our incurring significant fees and having fines and criminal sanctions imposed on us or our employees, and could adversely impact our business with government entities.

Our future success depends upon our ability to develop or acquire proprietary products and technology and assertions against us relating to intellectual property rights could harm our business.

Historically, we have been able to develop or acquire patented and other proprietary product innovations which have allowed us to produce what management believes to be technologically advanced products relative to most of our competition. While we are continuing to develop new technology and apply for patents, if we are unable to develop or acquire new products and technology in the future, our ability to maintain market share, and, consequently, our revenues and operating results, may be negatively affected.

Our industry is marked by rapid technological developments and innovations (such as the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning) and evolving industry standards. If we are unable to provide enhancements and new features and integrations for our existing platform, develop new products that achieve market acceptance, or innovate quickly enough to keep pace with these rapid technological developments, our business could be harmed.

Third parties may claim that our products infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. If a competitor were to challenge our patents or assert that our products or processes infringe its patent or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial litigation costs, be forced to design around their patents, pay substantial damages or even be forced to cease our operations, any of which could be expensive and/or have an adverse effect on our operating results. Third-party infringement claims, regardless of their outcome, would not only consume our financial resources, but also would divert the time and effort of our management and could result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of the affected products or services until resolution of the litigation.

Changes in the tax regimes and related government policies and regulations in the countries in which we operate, including the imposition of new or increased tariffs and any resulting trade wars, could adversely affect our results and our effective tax rate.

As a result of our international operations, we are subject to various taxes in both U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws, regulations and rates in these various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our future effective income tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, the adoption of a global minimum tax rate for corporate entities, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Changes to long-standing tax principles in the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities. Increases in our effective tax rate or tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on us.

The imposition of new tariffs, any increases in existing tariffs, changes in or the repeal of trade agreements or the imposition of any other trade restrictions may increase costs of component parts and raw materials, such as chassis, steel and aluminum, and cause disruptions on our supply chain. Any such developments may also weaken the economies of the countries in which we operate, resulting in lower economic growth rates and weakened demand for our products.

In addition, the provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act, which was enacted in August 2022, include a minimum tax equal to 15% of the adjusted financial statement income of certain large corporations, as well as a 1% excise tax on certain share buybacks by public corporations that would be imposed on such corporations. It is possible that changes under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted in December 2017, the IRA or other tax legislation could increase our future tax liability, which could in turn adversely impact our business and future profitability.

The effects of regulations relating to conflict minerals may adversely affect our business.

In 2012, the SEC adopted rules under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as &#8220;conflict minerals&#8221;, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. These rules could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of such minerals if they are found to be used in the manufacture of our products, as the number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, we have incurred and expect to incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products. In addition to the SEC regulation, the European Union adopted new requirements for European Union importers of conflict minerals, which went into effect on January 1, 2021, and that may impact and increase the cost of our conflict minerals compliance program. The Company&#8217;s supply chain is complex. As a result, we have encountered and continue to expect significant difficulty in determining the country of origin or the source and chain of custody for all &#8220;conflict minerals&#8221; used in our products and disclosing that our products are &#8220;conflict free&#8221; (meaning that they do not contain &#8220;conflict minerals&#8221; that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country). We may face reputational challenges from customers, investors or others if we are unable to verify the origins for all &#8220;conflict minerals&#8221; used in our products. In such event, we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict mineral free.

A product warranty or product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage, or an inability to acquire or maintain insurance at commercially reasonable rates, could have a material adverse effect upon our business.

We are subject to various claims, including product warranty and product liability claims arising in the ordinary course of business, and may at times be a party to various legal proceedings incidental to our business. We maintain reserves and liability insurance coverage at levels based upon commercial norms and our historical claims experience. If we manufacture poor quality products or receive defective materials, we may incur unforeseen costs in excess of what we have reserved in our financial statements. A successful product warranty, product liability or other claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage, or the inability of us to acquire or maintain insurance at commercially reasonable rates, could have a material adverse effect upon our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, we are subject to potential recalls of components or parts manufactured by suppliers which we purchase and incorporate into our towing and recovery equipment products, as well as potential recalls of our products from customers to cure manufacturing defects or in the event of a failure to comply with applicable regulatory standards or customers&#8217; order specifications. Moreover, the adverse publicity that may result from a product liability claim, perceived or actual defect with our products or a product recall could have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK 

Our stock price may fluctuate greatly as a result of the general volatility of the stock market, or from our involvement with activist shareholders.

From time to time, there may be significant volatility in the market price for our common stock. Our quarterly operating results, changes in earnings estimated by analysts, if any, changes in general conditions in our industry or the economy or the financial markets or other developments affecting us, including our ability to pay dividends, could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.

In addition, we seek to actively engage with shareholders and consider their views on business and strategy. However, we could be subject to actions or proposals from shareholders or others that do not align with our business strategies or the interests of our other shareholders. And publicly traded companies have increasingly become subject to campaigns by activist investors advocating corporate actions such as governance changes, financial restructurings, increased borrowings, special dividends, stock repurchases or even sales of assets or entire companies to third parties or to the activists themselves. Responding to activist investors could be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our business and operations, adversely affect our relationships with our employees, customers, or service providers, and divert the attention of our Board of Directors and senior management. Further, we may be required to incur significant fees and other expenses related to such matters, including fees and expenses for third-party advisors. Perceived uncertainties associated with such activities could interfere with our ability to effectively execute our strategic plan, impact long-term growth, and limit our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel, business partners, customers, and others important to our success. In addition, actions of these shareholders may cause periods of fluctuation in our

stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.

Our charter and bylaws contain anti-takeover provisions that may make it more difficult or expensive to acquire us in the future or may negatively affect our stock price.

Our charter and bylaws contain restrictions that may discourage other persons from attempting to acquire control of us, including, without limitation, prohibitions on shareholder action by written consent and advance notice requirements regarding amendments to certain provisions of our charter and bylaws. In addition, our charter authorizes the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The rights and preferences for any series of preferred stock may be set by the Board of Directors, in its sole discretion and without shareholder approval, and the rights and preferences of any such preferred stock may be superior to those of common stock and thus may adversely affect the rights of holders of common stock.

RISKS RELATED TO INDEBTEDNESS AND LIQUIDITY 

Our credit facility could restrict our ability to operate our business and failure to comply with its terms could adversely affect our business; our obligations to repurchase products from third-party lenders could adversely impact our future revenues and financial condition.

We incurred significant additional indebtedness during 2022 and 2023. As of December 31, 2024, we had $65.0 million in borrowings outstanding under our credit facility. Since December 2024, we drew net advances of $5.0 million from our credit facility for a balance of $70.0 million as of February 28, 2025. Our credit facility contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, and financial, affirmative and negative covenants for loan agreements of this kind. In addition, covenants under our current credit facility restrict our ability to pay cash dividends if the Company would be in violation of the minimum tangible net worth test or the leverage ratio test in the current loan agreement as a result of the dividend, among various restrictions. We have been in compliance with these covenants throughout 2024 and anticipate that we will continue to be in compliance during 2025. If we fail to comply with the requirements of our current credit facility, such non-compliance would result in an event of default. If not waived by the bank, such event of default would result in the acceleration of any amounts due under the current credit facility. 

We also have certain obligations to repurchase our products repossessed by third-party lenders if our distributors should default in their obligations to those lenders. Such repurchases could result in reduced net revenue in future periods as we resell such products and, if we are unable to sell the products, could adversely impact our financial condition.

We cannot assure you that we will continue to declare dividends on our common stock.

Our Board of Directors approved a dividend policy in 2011 to consider and pay quarterly dividends on our common stock subject to our ability to satisfy all applicable statutory requirements and our continued financial strength. While we currently intend to pay a quarterly dividend on shares of our common stock, to the extent that we have sufficient funds available for such purpose, the declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends on shares of common stock will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and we may reduce or discontinue entirely the payment of such dividends at any time. Our Board of Directors may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition and operating results, capital requirements, restrictions in financing agreements and such other factors as they may deem relevant from time to time.

GENERAL RISK FACTORS 

A disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology (&#8220;IT&#8221;) systems or any violation of data protection laws could adversely impact our business and operations. 

We rely on the accuracy, capacity and security of our IT systems and our ability to update these systems in response to the changing needs of our business. We use our IT systems to collect and store confidential and sensitive data, including information about our business, our customers, our suppliers and our employees. We rely on IT systems to protect this information and to keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to customers, and operate other critical functions. Our IT systems may be disrupted or fail for a number of reasons, including natural disasters, such as fires; power loss; software &#8220;bugs&#8221;, hardware defects or human error or malfeasance; or security breaches caused by hacking, computer viruses, malware, ransomware or other cyberattacks. 

As technology continues to evolve, we anticipate that we will collect and store even more data in the future and that our systems will increasingly use remote communication features that are susceptible to both willful and unintentional security breaches. We have incurred costs and expect to incur significant additional costs in order to implement security measures that we feel are appropriate to protect our IT systems. Despite these efforts, future attacks could result in our systems or data being breached and/or damaged by computer viruses or unauthorized physical or electronic access. Such a breach could result in theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets and/or unauthorized

##TABLE_END &#8203; 

access to controlled data and personal information stored in connection with our human resources function. In the event of a breach in security that allows third parties access to personal information, we are subject to a variety of ever-changing laws on a global basis that may require us to provide notification to the data owners, and that may subject us to lawsuits, fines and other means of regulatory enforcement or harm employee morale.

Any disruption, outage or breach of our IT systems could result in interruption of our business operations, damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in our security measures, all of which could adversely affect our business. In addition, if our systems are improperly implemented, breached, damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them. To the extent that any data is lost or destroyed or any confidential information is inappropriately disclosed or used, it could adversely affect our competitive position or customer relationships, harm our business and possibly lead to significant claims, liability, or fines based upon alleged breaches of contract or applicable laws, which liabilities may not be covered by insurance. The Company is also required to comply with increasingly complex and changing laws and regulations enacted to protect business and personal data in the United States and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, use, transmission and protection of personal information and other customer, vendor or employee data. Regulators globally are also imposing greater monetary fines for privacy violations including the GDPR that became effective in the European Union in 2018. The GDPR and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data, such as healthcare data or other personal information, could increase our cost of providing our products and services. 

Any loss of the services of our key executives could have a material adverse impact on our operations.

Our success is highly dependent on the continued services of our management team because of the management teams&#8217; experience and skills gained from their long-term service to the Company. The loss of services of one or more key members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on us .

Additional information regarding many of the risk areas outlined below can be found in the section of this Form on 10-K entitled: Part I, Item 1. Business, which precedes this section. A discussion of the global information for each specific underlying commodity can be found in Part I, in the section titled &#8220;Market Outlook.&#8221;

&#160;

Presented below are the risk factors for the Agricultural Funds.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

RISK FACTORS SPECIFIC TO THE AGRICULTURAL FUNDS 

&#160;

The Performance of Each Fund May Not Correlate with the Applicable Benchmark 

&#160;

There is no way to predict if or when investor demand might cause the Funds to approach position and/or accountability limits. The Underlying Funds have no intention of purchasing commodity interests on foreign exchanges. The Wheat Fund has not approached existing position limit levels of its Benchmark Component Futures Contracts which are traded on the CME with a 19,300 contract limit. Instead, the fund would file an 8&#8208;K and prospectus supplement to include the ability to purchase Kansas City Hard Red Winter Wheat futures or MGEX Hard Red Spring Wheat futures in the same contract size and in the same contract months as its existing Benchmark Component Futures Contract holdings. Position limits are 12,000 contracts on each of the exchanges in the aforementioned futures contracts. The Soybean Fund has not approached existing position limit levels of its Benchmark Component Futures Contracts which are traded on the CME with a 27,300 contract limit. The Sugar Fund has not approached existing position accountability levels of its Benchmark Component Futures Contracts which are traded on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) with a 15,000 contract limit. Instead, the fund would file an 8&#8208;K and prospectus supplement to include the ability to purchase NYSE Sugar futures in the same contract size and in the same contract months as its existing Benchmark Component Futures Contract holdings. Accountability levels are 9,000 contracts on the NYMEX. The Corn Fund has not approached existing position limit levels of its Benchmark Component Futures Contracts which are traded on the CME with a 57,800 contract limit.

&#160;

The Funds currently have two futures commission merchants through which they buy and sell futures contracts. Volatility in the commodity futures markets may lead one or all of the Funds' FCMs to impose risk mitigation procedures that could limit the Funds' investments in futures contracts beyond the accountability and position limits imposed by futures contract exchanges as discussed herein. One of the FCMs has imposed a financial ceiling on initial margin that could change and become more or less restrictive on the Funds' activities depending upon a variety of conditions beyond the Sponsor&#8217;s control. If the Funds' other current FCM were to impose position limits, or if any other FCM with which the Funds establish a relationship in the future were to impose position limits, the Funds' ability to meet its investment objective could be negatively impacted. The Funds continue to monitor and manage its existing relationships with each FCM and will continue to seek additional relationships with FCMs as needed.

&#160;

There are Risks Related to Fund Structure and Operations of the Funds 

&#160;

Consistent with its authority under the Trust Agreement and Delaware law, each Fund, in its sole discretion and without shareholder approval or advance notice, may change its investment objective, Benchmark or investment strategies, subject to applicable regulatory requirements, including, but not limited to, any requirement to amend applicable listing rules of the NYSE. The reasons for and circumstances that may trigger any such changes may vary widely and cannot be predicted. By way of example, the Funds may change the term structure or underlying components of the Benchmark in furtherance of the Fund&#8217;s investment objective of tracking the price of the specified commodity for future delivery (or, for TAGS, the investment objective of tracking the combined daily performance of the Underlying Funds) if, due to market conditions, a potential or actual imposition of position limits by the CFTC or futures exchange rules, or the imposition of risk mitigation measures by a futures commission merchant restricts the ability of the Fund (or, for TAGS, an Underlying Fund) to invest in the current Benchmark Futures Contracts. Shareholders may experience losses on their investments in the Fund as a result of such changes.

&#160;

The Sponsor has consulted with legal counsel, accountants and other advisers regarding the formation and operation of the Trust and the Funds. No counsel has been appointed to represent you in connection with the offering of Shares. Accordingly, you should consult with your own legal, tax and financial advisers regarding the desirability of an investment in the Shares.

&#160;

The Sponsor intends to re&#8208;invest any income and realized gains of a Fund in additional Benchmark Component Futures Contracts (or Shares of the Underlying Funds in the case of TAGS) or cash and cash equivalents rather than distributing cash to Shareholders. Therefore, unlike mutual funds, commodity pools or other investment pools that generally distribute income and gains to their investors, the Funds generally will not distribute cash to Shareholders. You should not invest in the Funds if you will need cash distributions from the Funds to pay taxes on your share of income and gains of the Funds, if any, or for any other reason. Although the Funds do not intend to make cash distributions, they reserve the right to do so in the Sponsor&#8217;s sole discretion, in certain situations, including for example, if the income earned from its investments held directly or posted as margin may reach levels that merit distribution, e.g., at levels where such income is not necessary to support its underlying investments in Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and investors adversely react to being taxed on such income without receiving distributions that could be used to pay such tax. Cash distributions may be made in these and similar instances.

&#160;

A Fund must pay for all brokerage fees, taxes, and other expenses, including licensing fees for the use of intellectual property, registration or other fees paid to the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;), or any other regulatory agency in connection with the offer and sale of subsequent Shares, after its initial registration, and all legal, accounting, printing and other expenses associated therewith. Each Fund also pays the fees and expenses associated with the Trust&#8217;s tax accounting and reporting requirements. Each Fund, excluding TAGS, is also contractually obligated to pay a management fee to the Sponsor. Such fees may be waived by the Sponsor at its discretion.

&#160;

The Funds may terminate at any time, regardless of whether the Funds have incurred losses, subject to the terms of the Trust Agreement. For example, the dissolution or resignation of the Sponsor would cause the Trust to terminate unless shareholders holding a majority of the outstanding Shares of the Trust, voting together as a single class, elect within 90 days of the event to continue the Trust and appoint a successor Sponsor. In addition, the Sponsor may terminate a Fund if it determines that the Fund&#8217;s aggregate net assets in relation to its operating expenses make the continued operation of the Fund unreasonable or imprudent. As of the date of this prospectus, each Fund pays the fees, costs, and expenses of its operations. If the Sponsor and the Funds are unable to raise sufficient funds so that each Fund&#8217;s expenses are reasonable in relation to its NAV, the Funds may be forced to terminate, and investors may lose all or part of their investment. Any expenses related to the operation of the Funds would need to be paid by the Fund at the time of termination.

&#160;

To the extent that investors use a Fund as a means of investing indirectly in a specific Commodity Interest, there is the risk that the changes in the price of the Fund&#8217;s Shares on the NYSE Arca will not closely track with the changes in spot price of that Commodity Interest. This could happen if the price of Shares traded on the NYSE Arca does not correlate with the Fund&#8217;s NAV, if the changes in the Fund&#8217;s NAV do not correlate with changes in the Benchmark, or if the changes in the Benchmark do not correlate with changes in the cash or spot price of the specific Commodity Interest. This is a risk because if these correlations are not sufficiently close, then investors may not be able to use the Fund as a cost effective way to invest indirectly in the specific Commodity Interest, or the underlying specific Commodity Interest in the case of TAGS, or as a hedge against the risk of loss in commodity related transactions.

&#160;

Only an Authorized Purchaser may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Funds. The Funds have a limited number of institutions that act as Authorized Purchasers. To the extent that these institutions exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation and/or redemption orders with respect to the Funds and no other Authorized Purchaser is able to step forward to create or redeem Creation Units, a Fund&#8217;s Shares may trade at a discount to NAV and possibly face trading halts and/or delisting. In addition, a decision by a market maker, lead market maker, or other large investor, to cease activities for the Funds or a decision by a secondary market participant to sell a significant number of the Fund&#8217;s Shares could adversely affect liquidity, the spread between the bid and ask quotes, and potentially the price of the Shares. The Sponsor can make no guarantees that participation by Authorized Purchasers or market makers will continue.

&#160;

&#160;

An investment in the Funds faces numerous risks from its Shares being traded in the secondary market, any of which may lead to the Fund&#8217;s Shares trading at a premium or discount to NAV. Although Fund Shares are listed for trading on the NYSE Arca, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such Shares will develop or be maintained. Trading in Fund Shares may be halted due to market conditions or for reasons that, in the view of the NYSE Arca, make trading in Shares inadvisable. There can be no assurance that the requirements of the NYSE Arca necessary to maintain the listing of any Fund will continue to be met or will remain unchanged or that the Shares will trade with any volume, or at all. The NAV of the Fund&#8217;s Shares will generally fluctuate with changes in the market value of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio holdings. The market prices of Shares will generally fluctuate in accordance with changes in the Fund&#8217;s NAV and supply and demand of Shares on the NYSE Arca. It cannot be predicted whether the Fund&#8217;s Shares will trade below at or above their NAV. Investors buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary market will pay brokerage commissions or other charges imposed by brokers as determined by that broker. Brokerage commissions are often a fixed amount and may be a significant proportional cost for investors seeking to buy or sell relatively small amounts of Shares. Trading volume of the Shares of each Fund could be affected by investors who trade significant quantities of Shares on any given business day. Such investors may or may not file all required SEC filings reporting ownership of such Shares. In addition, if interest rates realized on cash balances were to continue to decline, there is a risk that the net investment ratio of the Funds may increase from the current level.

&#160;

&#160;

Neither the Trust, nor any of the Funds, is an investment company subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940. Accordingly, you do not have the protections afforded by that statute, which, for example, requires investment companies to have a board of directors with a majority of disinterested directors and regulates the relationship between the investment company and its investment manager. 

&#160;

&#160;

The arrangements between clearing brokers and counterparties on the one hand, and the Funds on the other, generally are terminable by the clearing brokers or counterparty upon notice to the Funds. In addition, the agreements between the Funds and their third&#8208;party service providers, such as the Marketing Agent and the Custodian, are generally terminable at specified intervals. Upon termination, the Sponsor may be required to renegotiate or make other arrangements for obtaining similar services if the Funds intend to continue to operate. Comparable services from another party may not be available or may not be available on the terms as favorable as those of the expired or terminated arrangements.

&#160;

The Sponsor does not employ trading advisors for the Funds&#894; however, it reserves the right to employ them in the future. The only advisor to the Funds is the Sponsor. A lack of independent trading advisors may be disadvantageous to the Funds because they will not receive the benefit of their independent expertise.

&#160;

The Sponsor&#8217;s trading strategy is quantitative in nature, and it is possible that the Sponsor will make errors in its implementation. The execution of the quantitative strategy is subject to human error, such as incorrect inputs into the Sponsor&#8217;s computer systems and incorrect information provided to the Funds&#8217; clearing brokers. In addition, it is possible that a computer or software program may malfunction and cause an error in computation. Any failure, inaccuracy, or delay in executing the Funds&#8217; transactions could affect its ability to achieve its investment objective. It could also result in decisions to undertake transactions based on inaccurate or incomplete information. This could cause substantial losses on transactions. The Sponsor is not required to reimburse the Funds for any costs associated with an error in the placement or execution of a trade in commodity futures interests or Shares of the Underlying Funds.

&#160;

The Funds&#8217; trading activities depend on the integrity and performance of the computer and communications systems supporting them. Extraordinary transaction volume, hardware or software failure, power or telecommunications failure, a natural disaster or other catastrophe could cause the computer systems to operate at an unacceptably slow speed or even fail. Any significant degradation or failure of the systems that the Sponsor uses to gather and analyze information, enter orders, process data, monitor risk levels and otherwise engage in trading activities may result in substantial losses on transactions, liability to other parties, lost profit opportunities, damages to the Sponsor&#8217;s and Funds&#8217; reputations, increased operational expenses and diversion of technical resources.

&#160;

The development of complex computer and communications systems and new technologies may render the existing computer and communications systems supporting the Funds&#8217; trading activities obsolete. In addition, these computer and communications systems must be compatible with those of third parties, such as the systems of exchanges, clearing brokers and the executing brokers. As a result, if these third parties upgrade their systems, the Sponsor will need to make corresponding upgrades to effectively continue its trading activities. The Funds&#8217; future success may depend on the Funds&#8217; ability to respond to changing technologies on a timely and cost&#8208;effective basis.

&#160;

&#160;

The Funds depend on the proper and timely function of complex computer and communications systems maintained and operated by the futures exchanges, brokers, and other data providers that the Sponsor uses to conduct trading activities. Failure or inadequate performance of any of these systems could adversely affect the Sponsor&#8217;s ability to complete transactions, including its ability to close out positions, and result in lost profit opportunities and significant losses on commodity interest transactions. This could have a material adverse effect on revenues and materially reduce the Funds&#8217; available capital. For example, unavailability of price quotations from third parties may make it difficult or impossible for the Sponsor to conduct trading activities so that each Fund will closely track its Benchmark. Unavailability of records from brokerage firms may make it difficult or impossible for the Sponsor to accurately determine which transactions have been executed or the details, including price and time, of any transaction executed. This unavailability of information also may make it difficult or impossible for the Sponsor to reconcile its records of transactions with those of another party or to accomplish settlement of executed transactions.

&#160;

Natural or environmental disasters, such as earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes, tsunamis and other severe weather-related phenomena generally, and widespread disease, including public health disruptions, pandemics and epidemics (for example, the COVID-19 pandemic), can be highly disruptive to economies and markets. Such events can, directly or indirectly, negatively impact, and/or cause volatility in, the price of commodities and the value, pricing, and liquidity of the investments or other assets held by a Fund. 

&#160;

Recent macroeconomic conditions have been adversely impacted by geopolitical instability and military hostilities in multiple geographies. Geopolitical conflict, including war and armed conflicts (such as Russia&#8217;s continued military actions against Ukraine that started in February 2022, conflicts in the Middle East, and the expansion of such conflicts in surrounding areas), sanctions, the introduction of or changes in tariffs or trade barriers, global or local recessions, and acts of terrorism, can also, directly or indirectly, negatively impact, and/or cause volatility in, the price of commodities and the value, pricing, and liquidity of the investments or other assets held by a Fund.

&#160;

In late February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, significantly amplifying already existing geopolitical tensions among Russia and other countries in the region and in the west. The responses of countries and political bodies to Russia&#8217;s actions, the larger overarching tensions, and Ukraine&#8217;s military response and the potential for wider conflict may increase financial market volatility generally, have severe adverse effects on regional and global economic markets, and cause volatility in commodity prices including energy and grain prices, due to the region&#8217;s importance to these markets, potential impacts to global transportation and shipping, and other supply chain disruptions. These events are unpredictable and may lead to extended periods of price volatility.

&#160;

Failures or breaches of the electronic systems of the Funds, the Sponsor, the Custodian or mutual funds or other financial institutions in which the Funds invest, or the Funds&#8217; other service providers, market makers, Authorized Purchasers, NYSE Arca, exchanges on which Futures Contracts or Other Commodity Interests are traded or cleared, or counterparties have the ability to cause disruptions and negatively impact the Funds&#8217; business operations, potentially resulting in financial losses to the Funds and their shareholders. Such failures or breaches may include intentional cyber&#8208;attacks that may result in an unauthorized party gaining access to electronic systems in order to misappropriate a Fund&#8217;s assets or sensitive information. While the Funds have established business continuity plans and risk management systems seeking to address system breaches or failures, there are inherent limitations in such plans and systems. Furthermore, the Funds cannot control the cyber security plans and systems of the Custodian or mutual funds or other financial institutions in which the Funds invest, or the Funds&#8217; other service providers, market makers, Authorized Purchasers, NYSE Arca, exchanges on which Futures Contracts or Other Commodity Interests are traded or cleared, or counterparties.

&#160;

The Trust may, in its discretion, suspend the right to redeem Shares of the Funds or postpone the redemption settlement date: (1) for any period during which an applicable exchange is closed other than customary weekend or holiday closing, or trading is suspended or restricted&#894; (2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which delivery, disposal or evaluation of a Fund&#8217;s assets is not reasonably practicable&#894; (3) for such other period as the Sponsor determines to be necessary for the protection of Shareholders&#894; (4) if there is a possibility that any or all of the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts of a Fund on the specific exchange where the Fund is traded and from which the NAV of the Fund is calculated will be priced at a daily price limit restriction&#894; or (5) if, in the sole discretion of the Sponsor, the execution of such an order would not be in the best interest of the Funds or their Shareholders. In addition, the Trust will reject a redemption order if the order is not in proper form as described in the agreement with the Authorized Purchaser or if the fulfillment of the order, in the opinion of its counsel, might be unlawful. Any such postponement, suspension or rejection could adversely affect a redeeming Shareholder. For example, the resulting delay may adversely affect the value of the Shareholder&#8217;s redemption proceeds if the NAV of a Fund declines during the period of delay. The Trust Agreement provides that the Sponsor and its designees will not be liable for any loss or damage that may result from any such suspension or postponement. A minimum number of baskets and associated Shares are specified for each Fund in its prospectus and in Part I, Item 1 of this document. Once that minimum number of Shares outstanding is reached, there can be no further redemptions until there has been a Creation Basket.

&#160;

The ability of Authorized Participants to create or redeem Shares may be suspended for several reasons, including but not limited to the Fund voluntarily imposing such restrictions. A suspension in the ability of Authorized Participants would have no impact on the Fund&#8217;s investment objective &#8211; the Fund would continue to seek to track its benchmark. However, with respect to the impact of a suspension on the price of Fund Shares in the secondary market, investors may have to pay a higher price to buy Shares and receive a lower price when they sell their Shares. This &#8220;spread&#8221; may continue to widen the longer the suspension lasts.

&#160;

&#160;

The Intraday Indicative Value (&#8220;IIV&#8221;) and the Benchmark for each Fund are calculated and disseminated by ICE Data Indices, LLC under an agreement with the Sponsor. Additionally, information may be calculated and disseminated under similar agreements between the Sponsor and other third&#8208;party entities. Although reasonable efforts are taken to ensure the accuracy of the information disseminated under this agreement, there may, from time to time, be recalculations of previously released information.

&#160;

Third parties may assert that the Sponsor has infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights. Third parties may independently develop business methods, trademarks or proprietary software and other technology similar to that of the Sponsor and claim that the Sponsor has violated their intellectual property rights, including their copyrights, trademark rights, trade names, trade secrets and patent rights. As a result, the Sponsor may have to litigate in the future to determine the validity and scope of other parties&#8217; proprietary rights or defend itself against claims that it has infringed or otherwise violated other parties&#8217; rights. Any litigation of this type, even if the Sponsor is successful and regardless of the merits, may result in significant costs, may divert resources from the Funds, or may require the Sponsor to change its proprietary software and other technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements. The Sponsor has a patent on certain business methods and procedures used with respect to the Funds. The Sponsor utilizes certain proprietary software. Any unauthorized use of such proprietary software, business methods and/or procedures could adversely affect the competitive advantage of the Sponsor or the Funds and/or cause the Sponsor to take legal action to protect its rights.

&#160;

In managing and directing the day to day activities and affairs of the Funds, the Sponsor relies almost entirely on a small number of individuals, including Mr. Sal Gilbertie, Mr. Springer Harris and Ms. Cory Mullen&#8208;Rusin. If Mr. Gilbertie, Mr. Harris or Ms. Mullen&#8208;Rusin were to leave or be unable to carry out their present responsibilities, it may have an adverse effect on the management of the Funds. To the extent that the Sponsor establishes additional commodity pools, even greater demands will be placed on these individuals.

&#160;

The Sponsor manages the Trust, each Teucrium Fund, any other series of the Trust that may be formed in the future, and any advisory services provided under the Sponsors registration agreements. You cannot be assured that the Sponsor will be willing or able to continue to service each Fund for any length of time. If the Sponsor operates at a loss for an extended period, its capital will be depleted, and it may be unable to obtain additional financing necessary to continue its operations. If the Sponsor were unable to continue to provide services to these Funds, the Funds would be terminated if a replacement Sponsor could not be found. Any expenses related to the operation of the Funds would need to be paid by the Funds at the time of termination. If the Sponsor discontinues its activities on behalf of a Fund, the Fund may be adversely affected. If the Sponsor&#8217;s registrations with the CFTC or memberships in the NFA were revoked or suspended, the Sponsor would no longer be able to provide services to the Funds.

&#160;

The Funds seek to earn interest on cash balances available for investment. If actual interest rates were to continue to fall, the net investment loss of the Funds could be adversely impacted if the Sponsor were not able to waive expenses sufficient to cover any deficit.

&#160;

When constructing a diversified portfolio, investors often look for asset classes and individual securities that will enhance the risk adjusted returns of their portfolios. During the security selection process investors typically consider the security&#8217;s risk profile as well as its correlation to other portfolio holdings. Commodities are often included in a diversified portfolio due to their low correlation to traditional asset classes such as stocks and bonds. However, it must be noted that portfolio diversification does not eliminate the risk of loss associated with investing. Historical returns and correlations are not guaranteed in the future. It is important to note that past performance is not indicative of future results and that investments cannot be made directly into indexes which are often used to display correlation results.

&#160;

The Sponsor May Have Conflicts of Interest 

&#160;

The structure and operation of the Funds may involve conflicts of interest. For example, a conflict may arise because the Sponsor and its principals and affiliates may trade for themselves. In addition, the Sponsor has sole current authority to manage the investments and operations, and the interests of the Sponsor may conflict with the Shareholders&#8217; best interests, including the authority of the Sponsor to allocate expenses to and between the Funds.

&#160;

The Performance of Each Fund May Not Correlate with the Applicable Benchmark 

&#160;

If a Fund is required to sell short&#8208;term Treasury Securities or cash equivalents at a price lower than the price at which they were acquired, the Funds will experience a loss. This loss may adversely impact the price of the Shares and may decrease the correlation between the price of the Shares, the Benchmark, and the spot price of the specific commodity interest or the commodity interests of the Underlying Funds in the case of TAGS. The value of short&#8208;term Treasury Securities and other debt securities generally moves inversely with movements in interest rates. The prices of longer maturity securities are subject to greater market fluctuations as a result of changes in interest rates. While the short&#8208;term nature of a Fund&#8217;s investments in short&#8208;term Treasury Securities and cash equivalents should minimize the interest rate risk to which the Fund is subject, it is possible that the short&#8208;term Treasury Securities and cash equivalents held by the Funds will decline in value.

&#160;

&#160;

The Sponsor&#8217;s trading system is quantitative in nature, and it is possible that the Sponsor may make errors. In addition, it is possible that a computer or software program may malfunction and cause an error in computation.

&#160;

Increases in assets under management may affect trading decisions. While all of the Funds&#8217; assets are currently at manageable levels, the Sponsor does not intend to limit the amount of any Fund&#8217;s assets. The more assets the Sponsor manages, the more difficult it may be for it to trade profitably because of the difficulty of trading larger positions without adversely affecting prices and performance and of managing risk associated with larger positions.

&#160;

Each Fund seeks to have the changes in its Shares&#8217; NAV in percentage terms track changes in the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, rather than profit from speculative trading of the specific Commodity Interests, or the commodity interests of the Underlying Funds in the case of TAGS.

&#160;

The Sponsor therefore endeavors to manage each Fund so that the Fund&#8217;s assets are, unlike those of many other commodity pools, not leveraged (i.e., so that the aggregate amount of the Fund&#8217;s exposure to losses from its investments in specific Commodity Interests at any time will not exceed the value of the Fund&#8217;s assets). There is no assurance that the Sponsor will successfully implement this investment strategy. If the Sponsor permits a Fund to become leveraged, you could lose all or substantially all of your investment if the Fund&#8217;s trading positions suddenly turns unprofitable. These movements in price may be the result of factors outside of the Sponsor&#8217;s control and may not be anticipated by the Sponsor.

&#160;

The Sponsor cannot predict to what extent the performance of the commodity interest will or will not correlate to the performance of other broader asset classes such as stocks and bonds. If the performance of a specific Fund were to move more directly with the financial markets, an investment in the Funds may provide you little or no diversification benefits. Thus, in a declining market, the Funds may have no gains to offset your losses from other investments, and you may suffer losses on your investment in the Funds at the same time you may incur losses with respect to other asset classes. Variables such as drought, floods, weather, embargoes, tariffs, and other political events may have a larger impact on commodity and Commodity Interests prices than on traditional securities and broader financial markets. These additional variables may create additional investment risks that subject a Fund&#8217;s investments to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities. Lower correlation should not be confused with negative correlation, where the performance of two asset classes would be opposite of each other. There is no historical evidence that the spot price of a specific commodity, corn, for example, and prices of other financial assets, such as stocks and bonds, are negatively correlated. In the absence of negative correlation, a Fund cannot be expected to be automatically profitable during unfavorable periods for the stock market, or vice versa.

&#160;

Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee and the Sponsor are not liable, and have the right to be indemnified, for any liability or expense incurred absent gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Trustee or Sponsor, as the case may be. That means the Sponsor may require the assets of a Fund to be sold in order to cover losses or liability suffered by the Sponsor or by the Trustee. Any sale of that kind would reduce the NAV of the Funds and the value of their Shares.

&#160;

The Shares of a Fund are limited liability investments&#894; Shareholders may not lose more than the amount that they invest plus any profits recognized on their investment. However, Shareholders could be required, as a matter of bankruptcy law, to return to the estate of the Fund any distribution they received at a time when the Fund was in fact insolvent or that was made in violation of its Trust Agreement.

&#160;

The price relationship between the near month Commodity Futures Contract to expire and the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts for each Fund, or the Underlying Funds in the case of TAGS, will vary and may impact both a Fund&#8217;s total return over time and the degree to which such total return tracks the total return of the specific commodity price indices. In cases in which the near month contract&#8217;s price is lower than later expiring contracts&#8217; prices (a situation known as &#8220;contango&#8221; in the futures markets), then absent the impact of the overall movement in the commodity specific prices the value of the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts would tend to decline as they approach expiration which could cause the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts, and therefore the Fund&#8217;s total return, to track lower. In cases in which the near month contract&#8217;s price is higher than later expiring contracts&#8217; prices (a situation known as &#8220;backwardation&#8221; in the futures markets), then absent the impact of the overall movement in commodity specific prices, the value of the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts would tend to rise as they approach expiration.

&#160;

&#160;

While it is expected that the trading prices of the Shares will fluctuate in accordance with the changes in a Fund&#8217;s NAV, the prices of Shares may also be influenced by various market factors, including but not limited to, the number of Shares of the Funds outstanding and the liquidity of the underlying Commodity Interests. There is no guarantee that the Shares will not trade at appreciable discounts from, and/or premiums to, the Fund&#8217;s NAV. This could cause the changes in the price of the Shares to substantially vary from the changes in the spot price of the underlying commodity, even if a Fund&#8217;s NAV were closely tracking movements in the spot price of that commodity. If this occurs, you may incur a partial or complete loss of your investment.

&#160;

In addition to certain fees paid to each Fund&#8217;s service providers, each Fund pays the Sponsor a fee of 1.00% of assets under management per annum, regardless of Fund Performance. Over time, a Fund&#8217;s assets could be depleted if investment performance does not exceed such fees.

&#160;

Investors, including those who directly participate in the specific commodity market, may choose to use a Fund as a vehicle to hedge against the risk of loss, and there are risks involved in hedging activities. While hedging can provide protection against an adverse movement in market prices, it can also preclude a hedger&#8217;s opportunity to benefit from a favorable market movement.

&#160;

While it is not the current intention of the Funds to take physical delivery of any Commodity under its Commodity Interests, Commodity Futures Contracts are traditionally physically deliverable contracts, and, unless a position was traded out of, it is possible to take or make delivery under these and some Other Commodity Interests. Storage costs associated with purchasing the specific commodity could result in costs and other liabilities that could impact the value of the Commodity Futures Contracts or certain Other Commodity Interests. Storage costs include the time value of money invested in the physical commodity plus the actual costs of storing the commodity less any benefits from ownership that are not obtained by the holder of a futures contract. In general, Commodity Futures Contracts have a one&#8208;month delay for contract delivery and the pricing of back month contracts (the back month is any future delivery month other than the spot month) include storage costs. To the extent that these storage costs change for the commodity while a Fund holds the Commodity Interests, the value of the Commodity Interests, and therefore the Fund&#8217;s NAV, may change as well.

&#160;

The Funds are not actively managed and are designed to track a benchmark, regardless of whether the price of the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts is flat, declining, or rising.

&#160;

The design of each Fund&#8217;s Benchmark is such that the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts change throughout the year, and the Fund&#8217;s investments must be rolled periodically to reflect the changing composition of the Benchmark. For example, when the second to expire Commodity Futures Contract becomes the first to expire contract, such contract will no longer be a Benchmark Component Futures Contract and the Fund&#8217;s position in it will no longer be consistent with tracking the Benchmark. In the event of a commodity futures market where near to expire contracts trade at a higher price than longer to expire contracts, a situation referred to as &#8220;backwardation,&#8221; then absent the impact of the overall movement in the specific commodity prices of the Funds, the value of the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts would tend to rise as they approach expiration. As a result, a Fund may benefit because it would be selling more expensive contracts and buying less expensive ones on an ongoing basis. Conversely, using corn as an example, in the event of a corn futures market where near to expire contracts trade at a lower price than longer to expire contracts, a situation referred to as &#8220;contango,&#8221; then absent the impact of the overall movement in corn prices the value of the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts would tend to decline as they approach expiration. As a result, the Fund&#8217;s total return may be lower than might otherwise be the case because it would be selling less expensive contracts and buying more expensive ones. The impact of backwardation and contango may lead the total return of a Fund to vary significantly from the total return of other price references, such as the spot price of the specific commodity. In the event of a prolonged period of contango, and absent the impact of rising or falling specific commodity prices, this could have a significant negative impact on a Fund&#8217;s NAV and total return.

&#160;

Position limits and daily price fluctuation limits set by the CFTC and the exchanges have the potential to cause tracking error, which could cause the price of Shares of the Funds to substantially vary from the Benchmark and prevent you from being able to effectively use the Funds as a way to hedge against underlying commodity related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in the underlying commodity.

&#160;

There is no way to predict if or when investor demand might cause the Funds to approach position and/or accountability limits. The Underlying Funds have no intention of purchasing commodity interests on foreign exchanges. The Wheat Fund has not approached existing position limit levels of its Benchmark Component Futures Contracts which are traded on the CME with a 19,300 contract limit. Instead, the fund would file an 8&#8208;K and prospectus supplement to include the ability to purchase Kansas City Hard Red Winter Wheat futures or MGEX Hard Red Spring Wheat futures in the same contract size and in the same contract months as its existing Benchmark Component Futures Contract holdings. Position limits are 12,000 contracts on each of the exchanges in the aforementioned futures contracts. The Soybean Fund has not approached existing position limit levels of its Benchmark Component Futures Contracts which are traded on the CME with a 27,300 contract limit. The Sugar Fund has not approached existing position accountability levels of its Benchmark Component Futures Contracts which are traded on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) with a 15,000 contract limit. Instead, the fund would file an 8&#8208;K and prospectus supplement to include the ability to purchase NYSE Sugar futures in the same contract size and in the same contract months as its existing Benchmark Component Futures Contract holdings. Accountability levels are 9000 contracts on the NYMEX. The Corn Fund has not approached existing position limit levels of its Benchmark Component Futures Contracts which are traded on the CME with a 57,800 contract limit.

&#160;

The Funds currently have three futures commission merchants through which they buy and sell futures contracts. The recent volatility in the commodity futures markets may lead one or both of the Funds&#8217; FCMs to impose risk mitigation procedures that could limit the Funds&#8217; investments in futures contracts beyond the accountability and position limits imposed by futures contract exchanges as discussed herein. One of the FCMs has imposed a financial ceiling on initial margin that could change and become more or less restrictive on the Funds&#8217; activities depending upon a variety of conditions beyond the Sponsor&#8217;s control. If the Funds&#8217; other current FCM were to impose position limits, or if any other FCM with which the Funds establish a relationship in the future were to impose position limits, the Funds&#8217; ability to meet its investment objective could be negatively impacted. The Funds continue to monitor and manage its existing relationships with each FCM and will continue to seek additional relationships with FCMs as needed.

&#160;

The Trust Structure and the Trust Agreement Provide Limited Shareholder Rights 

&#160;

You will have no rights to participate in the management of any of the Funds and will have to rely on the duties and judgment of the Sponsor to manage the Funds.

&#160;

As interests in separate series of a Delaware statutory trust, the Shares do not involve the rights normally associated with the ownership of shares of a corporation (including, for example, the right to bring shareholder oppression and derivative actions). In addition, the Shares have limited voting and distribution rights (for example, Shareholders do not have the right to elect directors, as the Trust does not have a board of directors, and generally will not receive regular distributions of the net income and capital gains earned by the Funds). The Funds are also not subject to certain investor protection provisions of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and the NYSE Arca governance rules (for example, audit committee requirements).

&#160;

&#160;

Each Fund is a series of a Delaware statutory trust and not itself a legal entity separate from the other Funds. The Delaware Statutory Trust Act provides that if certain provisions are included in the formation and governing documents of a statutory trust organized in series and if separate and distinct records are maintained for any series and the assets associated with that series are held in separate and distinct records and are accounted for in such separate and distinct records separately from the other assets of the statutory trust, or any series thereof, then the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses incurred by a particular series are enforceable against the assets of such series only, and not against the assets of the statutory trust generally or any other series thereof. Conversely, none of the debts, liabilities, obligations, and expenses incurred with respect to any other series thereof is enforceable against the assets of such series. The Sponsor is not aware of any court case that has interpreted this inter&#8208;series limitation on liability or provided any guidance as to what is required for compliance. The Sponsor intends to maintain separate and distinct records for each Fund and account for each Fund separately from any other Trust series, but it is possible a court could conclude that the methods used do not satisfy the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, which would potentially expose assets in any Fund to the liabilities of one or more of the Funds and/or any other Trust series created in the future.

&#160;

Neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee is obligated to, although each may, in its respective discretion, prosecute any action, suit or other proceeding in respect of any Fund property. The Trust Agreement does not confer upon Shareholders the right to prosecute any such action, suit, or other proceeding.

&#160;

Regulatory changes or actions, including the implementation of new legislation, is impossible to predict but may significantly and adversely affect the Funds. 

&#160;

The futures markets are subject to comprehensive statutes, regulations, and margin requirements. Such statutes, regulations and requirements are subject to ongoing modification by governmental and judicial action. The effect of any future regulatory change on a Fund is impossible to predict, but it could be substantial and adverse. In addition, the CFTC, SEC, futures exchanges, and other entities are authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency including, for example, the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits or higher margin requirements, the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading. For a more detailed discussion of the regulations to be imposed by the CFTC and the SEC and the potential impacts thereof on a Fund, please see &#8220; Item &#160; 1. Business &#160;&#8211; Regulatory Considerations &#8221; in this annual report on Form 10&#8209;K.

&#160;

There Is No Assurance that There Will Be a Liquid Market for the Shares of the Funds or the Funds &#8217; Underlying Investments, which May Mean that Shareholders May Not be Able to Sell Their Shares at a Market Price Relatively Close to the NAV 

&#160;

If a substantial number of requests for redemption of Redemption Baskets are received by the Funds during a relatively short period of time, the Funds may not be able to satisfy the requests from the Fund&#8217;s assets not committed to trading. As a consequence, it could be necessary to liquidate the Fund&#8217;s trading positions before the time that its trading strategies would otherwise call for liquidation, which may result in losses.

&#160;

The ability of Authorized Participants to create or redeem Shares may be suspended for several reasons, including but not limited to the Fund voluntarily imposing such restrictions. A suspension in the ability of Authorized Participants would have no impact on the Fund&#8217;s investment objective &#8211; the Fund would continue to seek to track its benchmark. However, with respect to the impact of a suspension on the price of Fund Shares in the secondary market, investors may have to pay a higher price to buy Shares and receive a lower price when they sell their Shares. This &#8220;spread&#8221; may continue to widen the longer the suspension lasts.

&#160;

A portion of a Fund&#8217;s investments could be illiquid, which could cause large losses to investors at any time or from time to time.

&#160;

A Fund may not always be able to liquidate its positions in its investments at the desired price. As to futures contracts, it may be difficult to execute a trade at a specific price when there is a relatively small volume of buy and sell orders in a market. Limits imposed by futures exchanges or other regulatory organizations, such as accountability levels, position limits and price fluctuation limits, may contribute to a lack of liquidity with respect to some exchange traded commodity Interests. In addition, over the counter contracts may be illiquid because they are contracts between two parties and generally may not be transferred by one party to a third party without the counterparty&#8217;s consent. Conversely, a counterparty may give its consent, but the Funds still may not be able to transfer an over the counter Commodity Interest to a third party due to concerns regarding the counterparty&#8217;s credit risk.

&#160;

The exchanges set daily price fluctuation limits on futures contracts. The daily price fluctuation limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of futures contracts may vary either up or down from the previous day&#8217;s settlement price. Once the daily price fluctuation limit has been reached in a particular futures contract, no trades may be made at a price beyond that limit.

&#160;

On December 16, 2016, as mandated by the Dodd&#8208;Frank Act, the CFTC adopted a final rule that aggregate all positions, for purposes of position limits&#894; such positions include futures contracts, futures&#8208;equivalent positions, over the counter swaps and options (i.e., contracts that are not traded on exchanges). These aggregation requirements became effective on February 14, 2017 and could limit the Fund&#8217;s ability to establish positions in commodity over the counter instruments if the assets of the Funds were to grow substantially.

&#160;

&#160;

Effective March 15, 2021, the CFTC adopted amendments in the Final Rule to confirm regulations concerning speculative position limits to the relevant Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010 (&#8216;&#8216;Dodd&#8208;Frank Act&#8217;&#8217;) amendments to the Commodity Exchange Act (&#8216;&#8216;CEA&#8217;&#8217;). Among other regulatory amendments, the Commission is adopting: New and amended Federal spot&#8208;month limits for 25 physical commodity derivatives&#894; amended single month and all&#8208;months combined limits for most of the agricultural contracts currently subject to Federal position limits&#894; new and amended definitions for use throughout the position limits regulations, including a revised definition of &#8216;&#8216;bona fide hedging transaction or position&#8217;&#8217; and a new definition of &#8216;&#8216;economically equivalent swaps&#8217;&#8217;&#894; amended rules governing exchange&#8208;set limit levels and grants of exemptions therefrom&#894; a new streamlined process for bona fide hedging recognitions for purposes of Federal position limits&#894; new enumerated bona fide hedges&#894; and amendments to certain regulatory provisions that would eliminate Form 204 while also enabling the Commission to leverage and receive cash&#8208;market reporting submitted directly to the exchanges by market participants. If the total net assets of the Funds were to increase significantly from current levels, the Position Limit Rules as proposed could negatively impact the ability of the Funds to meet its respective investment objectives through limits that may inhibit the Sponsor&#8217;s ability to sell additional Creation Baskets of the Funds. However, it is not expected that the Funds will reach asset levels that would cause these position limits to be reached in the near future.

&#160;

A Fund may invest in other commodity interests. To the extent that these other commodity interests are contracts individually negotiated between their parties, they may not be as liquid as Benchmark Component Commodity Futures Contracts and will expose the Funds to credit risk that its counterparty may not be able to satisfy its obligations to the Funds.

&#160;

The changing nature of the participants in the commodity specific market will influence whether futures prices are above or below the expected future spot price. Producers of the specific commodity will typically seek to hedge against falling commodity prices by selling Commodity Futures Contracts. Therefore, if commodity producers become the predominant hedgers in the futures market, prices of Commodity Futures Contracts will typically be below expected future spot prices. Conversely, if the predominant hedgers in the futures market are the purchasers of the commodity, who purchase Commodity Futures Contracts to hedge against a rise in prices, prices of the Commodity Futures Contracts will likely be higher than expected future spot prices. This can have significant implications for a Fund when it is time to sell a Commodity Futures Contract that is no longer a Benchmark Component Futures Contract and purchase a new Commodity Futures Contract or to sell a Commodity Futures Contract to meet redemption requests. A Fund may invest in Other Commodity Interests. To the extent that these Other Commodity Interests are contracts individually negotiated between their parties, they may not be as liquid as Commodity Futures Contracts and will expose the Fund to credit risk that its counterparty may not be able to satisfy its obligations to the Fund.

&#160;

A Fund&#8217;s NAV includes, in part, any unrealized profits or losses on open swap agreements, futures or forward contracts. Under normal circumstances, the NAV reflects the quoted exchange settlement price of open futures contracts on the date when the NAV is being calculated. In instances when the quoted settlement price of a futures contract traded on an exchange may not be reflective of fair value based on market condition, generally due to the operation of daily limits or other rules of the exchange or otherwise, the NAV may not reflect the fair value of open future contracts on such date. For purposes of financial statements and reports, the Sponsor will recalculate the NAV where necessary to reflect the &#8220;fair value&#8221; of a Futures Contract when the Futures Contract closes at its price fluctuation limit for the day.

&#160;

In the event that one or more Authorized Purchasers that are actively involved in purchasing and selling Shares cease to be so involved, the liquidity of the Shares will likely decrease, which could adversely affect the market price of the Shares and result in your incurring a loss on your investment. In addition, a decision by a market maker or lead market maker to cease activities for the Funds could adversely affect liquidity, the spread between the bid and ask quotes, and potentially the price of the Shares. The Sponsor can make no guarantees that participation by Authorized Purchasers or market makers will continue.

&#160;

If a minimum number of Shares is outstanding for a Fund, market makers may be less willing to purchase Shares of that Fund in the secondary market which may limit your ability to sell Shares. There are a minimum number of baskets and associated Shares specified for each Fund. Once the minimum number of baskets is reached, there can be no more redemptions by an Authorized Purchaser of that Fund until there has been a Creation Basket. In such case, market makers may be less willing to purchase Shares of that Fund from investors in the secondary market, which may in turn limit the ability of Shareholders of that Fund to sell their Shares in the secondary market.

&#160;

Trading in Shares of a Fund may be halted due to market conditions or, in light of NYSE Arca rules and procedures, for reasons that, in the view of the NYSE Arca, make trading in Shares inadvisable. In addition, trading is subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to &#8220;circuit breaker&#8221; rules that require trading to be halted for a specified period based on a specified market decline. There can be no assurance that the requirements necessary to maintain the listing of the Shares will continue to be met or will remain unchanged. A Fund will be terminated if its Shares are delisted.

&#160;

The ability of Authorized Participants to create or redeem Shares may be suspended for several reasons, including but not limited to the Fund voluntarily imposing such restrictions. A suspension in the ability of Authorized Participants would have no impact on the Fund&#8217;s investment objective &#8211; the Fund would continue to seek to track its benchmark. However, with respect to the impact of a suspension on the price of Fund Shares in the secondary market, investors may have to pay a higher price to buy Shares and receive a lower price when they sell their Shares. This &#8220;spread&#8221; may continue to widen the longer the suspension lasts.

&#160;

&#160;

There is Credit Risk Associated with the Operation of the Funds, Service Providers and Counterparties Which May Cause an Investment Loss 

&#160;

For all of the Funds except for TAGS, the majority of each Fund&#8217;s assets are held in cash and short&#8208;term cash equivalents with the Custodian or with one or more alternate financial institutions unrelated to the Custodian (each, a &#8220;Financial Institution&#8221;). Any cash or cash equivalents invested by a Fund will be placed by the Sponsor in a Financial Institution deemed by the Sponsor to be of investment&#8208;grade credit quality. There is a risk that the proceeds from the sale of the cash equivalents could be less than the purchase price.

&#160;

The insolvency of the Custodian, any Financial Institution in which funds are deposited, or Commercial Paper Issuer could result in a complete loss of a Fund&#8217;s assets held by the Custodian or the Financial Institution, which, at any given time, would likely comprise a substantial portion of a Fund&#8217;s total assets. Assets deposited with the Custodian or a Financial Institution will generally exceed federally insured limits. For TAGS, the vast majority of the Fund&#8217;s assets are held in Shares of the Underlying Funds. The failure or insolvency of the Custodian or the Financial Institution could impact the ability to access in a timely manner TAGS&#8217; assets held by the Custodian.

&#160;

Under CFTC regulations, a clearing broker with respect to a Fund&#8217;s exchange traded Commodity Interests must maintain customers&#8217; assets in a bulk segregated account. If a clearing broker fails to do so or is unable to satisfy a substantial deficit in a customer account, its other customers may be subject to risk of a substantial loss of their funds in the event of that clearing broker&#8217;s bankruptcy. In that event, the clearing broker&#8217;s customers, such as a Fund, are entitled to recover, even in respect of property specifically traceable to them, only a proportional share of all property available for distribution to all of that clearing broker&#8217;s customers. A Fund also may be subject to the risk of the failure of, or delay in performance by, any exchanges and markets and their clearing organizations, if any, on which Commodity Interests are traded. From time to time, the clearing brokers may be subject to legal or regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of their business. A clearing broker&#8217;s involvement in costly or time&#8208;consuming legal proceedings may divert financial resources or personnel away from the clearing broker&#8217;s trading operations, which could impair the clearing broker&#8217;s ability to successfully execute and clear a Fund&#8217;s trades. For additional information regarding recent regulatory developments that may impact the Funds or the Trust, refer to the section entitled &#8220;Regulatory Considerations&#8221; section of this document.

&#160;

Commodity pools&#8217; trading positions in futures contracts or other commodity interests are typically required to be secured by the deposit of margin funds that represent only a small percentage of a futures contract&#8217;s (or other commodity interest&#8217;s) entire market value. This feature permits commodity pools to &#8220;leverage&#8221; their assets by purchasing or selling futures contracts (or other commodity interests) with an aggregate notional amount in excess of the commodity pool&#8217;s assets. While this leverage can increase a pool&#8217;s profits, relatively small adverse movements in the price of a pool&#8217;s commodity interests can cause significant losses to the pool. While the Sponsor does not intend to leverage the Funds&#8217; assets, it is not prohibited from doing so under the Trust Agreement. If the Sponsor were to cause or permit a Fund to become leveraged, you could lose all or substantially all of your investment if the Fund&#8217;s trading positions suddenly turns unprofitable.

&#160;

An &#8220;exchange for related position&#8221; (&#8220;EFRP&#8221;) can be used by the Funds as a technique to facilitate the exchanging of a futures hedge position against a creation or redemption order, and thus the Funds may use an EFRP transaction in connection with the creation and redemption of Shares. The market specialist/market maker that is the ultimate purchaser or seller of Shares in connection with the creation or redemption basket, respectively, agrees to sell or purchase a corresponding offsetting futures position which is then settled on the same business day as a cleared futures transaction by the FCMs. The Funds will become subject to the credit risk of the market specialist/market maker until the EFRP is settled or terminated. The Funds report all activity related to EFRP transactions under the procedures and guidelines of the CFTC and the exchanges on which the futures are traded. EFRPs are subject to specific rules of the CME and CFTC guidance. It is likely that EFRP mechanisms will be subject to changes in the future which may make it uneconomical or impossible from the regulatory perspective to utilize this mechanism by the Funds.

&#160;

A portion of the Fund&#8217;s assets may be used to trade over the counter Commodity Interests, such as forward contracts or swaps. Over the counter contracts are typically traded on a principal&#8208;to&#8208;principal cleared and non&#8208;cleared basis through dealer markets that are dominated by major money center and investment banks and other institutions and that prior to the passage of the Dodd&#8208;Frank Act had been essentially unregulated by the CFTC, although this is an area of pending, substantial regulatory change. The markets for over the counter contracts will continue to rely upon the integrity of market participants in lieu of the additional regulation imposed by the CFTC on participants in the futures markets. The forward markets have been largely unregulated, except for anti&#8208;manipulation and anti&#8208;fraud prohibitions, forward contracts have been executed bi&#8208;laterally and, in general historically, forward contracts were not cleared or guaranteed by a third party. On November 16, 2012, the Secretary of the Treasury issued a final determination that exempts both foreign exchange swaps and foreign exchange forwards from the definition of &#8220;swap&#8221; and, by extension, additional regulatory requirements (such as clearing and margin). The final determination does not extend to other FX derivatives, such as FX options, certain currency swaps, and non&#8208;deliverable forwards. While the Dodd&#8208;Frank Act and certain regulations adopted thereunder are intended to provide additional protections to participants in the over the counter market, the lack of regulation in these markets could expose the Funds in certain circumstances to significant losses in the event of trading abuses or financial failure by participants. While increased regulation of over the counter Commodity Interests is likely to result from changes that are required to be effectuated by the Dodd&#8208;Frank Act, there is no guarantee that such increased regulation will be effective to reduce these risks.

&#160;

&#160;

Each Fund faces the risk of non&#8208;performance by the counterparties to the over the counter contracts. Unlike in futures contracts, the counterparty to these contracts is generally a single bank or other financial institution, rather than a clearing organization backed by a group of financial institutions. As a result, there will be greater counterparty credit risk in these transactions. A counterparty may not be able to meet its obligations to a Fund, in which case the Fund could suffer significant losses on these contracts. If a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations due to financial difficulties, a Fund may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery in a bankruptcy or other reorganization proceeding. During any such period, a Fund may have difficulty in determining the value of its contracts with the counterparty, which in turn could result in the overstatement or understatement of the Fund&#8217;s NAV. A Fund may eventually obtain only limited recovery or no recovery in such circumstances.

&#160;

Over the counter contracts may have terms that make them less marketable than Futures Contracts. Over the counter contracts are less marketable because they are not traded on an exchange, do not have uniform terms and conditions, and are entered into based upon the creditworthiness of the parties and the availability of credit support, such as collateral, and in general, they are not transferable without the consent of the counterparty. These conditions make such contracts less liquid than standardized futures contracts traded on a commodities exchange and diminish the ability to realize the full value of such contracts. In addition, even if collateral is used to reduce counterparty credit risk, sudden changes in the value of over the counter transactions may leave a party open to financial risk due to a counterparty default since the collateral held may not cover a party&#8217;s exposure on the transaction in such situations. In general, valuing OTC derivatives is less certain than valuing actively traded financial instruments such as exchange traded futures contracts and securities because the price and terms on which such OTC derivatives are entered into or can be terminated are individually negotiated, and those prices and terms may not reflect the best price or terms available from other sources. In addition, while market makers and dealers generally quote indicative prices or terms for entering into or terminating OTC contracts, they typically are not contractually obligated to do so, particularly if they are not a party to the transaction. As a result, it may be difficult to obtain an independent value for an outstanding OTC derivatives transaction.

&#160;

In addition, regulations adopted by global prudential regulators that are now in effect require certain prudentially regulated entities and certain of their affiliates and subsidiaries (including swap dealers) to include in their derivatives contracts and certain other financial contracts, terms that delay or restrict the rights of counterparties (such as the Funds) to terminate such contracts, foreclose upon collateral, exercise other default rights or restrict transfers of credit support in the event that the prudentially regulated entity and/or its affiliates are subject to certain types of resolution or insolvency proceedings. Similar regulations and laws have been adopted in non&#8208;US jurisdictions that may apply to a Fund&#8217;s counterparties located in those jurisdictions. It is possible that these new requirements, as well as potential additional related government regulation, could adversely affect a Fund&#8217;s ability to terminate existing derivatives contracts, exercise default rights or satisfy obligations owed to it with collateral received under such contracts.

&#160;

There are Risks Associated with Trading in International Markets 

&#160;

A significant portion of the Futures Contracts entered into by the Funds are traded on United States exchanges including the CBOT. However, a portion of the Fund&#8217;s trades may take place on markets or exchanges outside the United States. Some non&#8208;U.S. markets present risks because they are not subject to the same degree of regulation as their U.S. counterparts. None of the CFTC, NFA, or any domestic exchange regulates activities of any foreign boards of trade or exchanges, including the execution, delivery and clearing of transactions, has the power to compel enforcement of the rules of a foreign board of trade or exchange or of any applicable non&#8208;U.S. laws. Similarly, the rights of market participants, such as the Funds, in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of a non&#8208;U.S. market or broker are also likely to be more limited than in the case of U.S. markets or brokers. As a result, in these markets, the Funds have less legal and regulatory protection than they do when trading domestically. Currently the Funds do not place trades on any markets or exchanges outside of the United States and do not anticipate doing so in the near future.

&#160;

In some of these non&#8208;U.S. markets, the performance on a futures contract is the responsibility of the counterparty and is not backed by an exchange or clearing corporation and therefore exposes the Funds to credit risk. Additionally, trading on non&#8208;U.S. exchanges is subject to the risks presented by exchange controls, expropriation, increased tax burdens and exposure to local economic declines and political instability. An adverse development with respect to any of these variables could reduce the profit or increase the loss earned on trades in the affected international markets.

&#160;

The price of any non&#8208;U.S. Commodity Interest and, therefore, the potential profit and loss on such investment, may be affected by any variance in the foreign exchange rate between the time the order is placed and the time it is liquidated, offset, or exercised. However, a portion of the trades for a Fund may take place in markets and on exchanges outside the U. S. Some non&#8208;U.S. markets present risks because they are not subject to the same degree of regulation as their U.S. counterparts. Some non&#8208;U.S. markets present risks because they are not subject to the same degree of regulation as their U. S. counterparts. As a result, changes in the value of the local currency relative to the U. S. dollar may cause losses to the Funds even if a contract is profitable.

&#160;

&#160;

The CFTC&#8217;s implementation of its regulations under the Dodd&#8208;Frank Act may further affect the Fund&#8217;s ability to enter into foreign exchange contracts and to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange losses. Some non&#8208;U.S. exchanges also may be in a more developmental stage so that prior price histories may not be indicative of current price dynamics. In addition, the Funds may not have the same access to certain positions on foreign trading exchanges as do local traders, and the historical market data on which the Sponsor bases its strategies may not be as reliable or accessible as it is for U.S. exchanges.

&#160;

The Funds are Treated as Partnerships for U.S. Federal Income Tax Purposes which Means that There May be a Lack of Certainty as to Tax Treatment for an Investor &#8217; s Gains and Losses 

&#160;

Cash or property will be distributed by the Funds at the sole discretion of the Sponsor, and the Sponsor currently does not intend to make cash or other distributions with respect to Shares. You will be required to pay U.S. federal income tax and, in some cases, state, local, or foreign income tax, on your allocable share of the Fund&#8217;s taxable income, without regard to whether you receive distributions or the amount of any distributions. Therefore, the tax liability resulting from your ownership of Shares may exceed the amount of cash or value of property (if any) distributed.

&#160;

Due to the application of the assumptions and conventions applied by a Fund in making allocations for U.S. federal income tax purposes and other factors, your allocable share of the Fund&#8217;s income, gain, deduction, or loss may be different than your economic profit or loss from your Shares for a taxable year. This difference could be temporary or permanent and, if permanent, could result in your being taxed on amounts in excess of your economic income.

&#160;

The Funds are treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The U.S. tax rules pertaining to entities taxed as partnerships are complex and their application to publicly traded partnerships, such as the Funds, is in many respects uncertain. The Funds apply certain assumptions and conventions in an attempt to comply with the intent of the applicable rules and to report taxable income, gains, deductions, losses, and credits in a manner that properly reflects Shareholders&#8217; economic gains and losses. These assumptions and conventions may not fully comply with all aspects of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), and applicable Treasury Regulations, however, and it is possible that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the &#8220;IRS&#8221;) will successfully challenge our allocation methods and require us to reallocate items of income, gain, deduction, loss, or credit in a manner that adversely affects you. If this occurs, you may be required to file an amended tax return and to pay additional taxes plus deficiency interest.

&#160;

In addition, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, the Funds may be liable for U.S. federal income tax on any &#8220;imputed underpayment&#8221; of tax resulting from an adjustment as a result of an IRS audit. The amount of the imputed underpayment generally includes increases in allocations of items of income or gains to any investor and decreases in allocations of items of deduction, loss, or credit to any investor without any offset for any corresponding reductions in allocations of items of income or gain to any investor or increases in allocations of items of deduction, loss, or credit to any investor. If a Fund is required to pay any U.S. federal income tax on any imputed underpayment, the resulting tax liability would reduce the net assets of the Fund and would likely have an adverse impact on the value of the Fund&#8217;s Shares. In such a case, the tax liability would in effect be borne by Shareholders that own Shares at the time of such assessment, which may be different persons, or persons with different ownership percentages, than persons owning Shares for the tax year under audit. Under certain circumstances, the Funds may be eligible to make an election to cause Shareholders to take into account the amount of any imputed underpayment, including any interest and penalties. The ability of a publicly traded partnership such as the Funds to make this election is uncertain. If the election is made, the Funds would be required to provide Shareholders who owned beneficial interests in the Shares in the year to which the adjusted allocations relate with a statement setting forth their proportionate Shares of the adjustment (&#8220;Adjusted K&#8208;1s&#8221;). The investors would be required to take the adjustment into account in the taxable year in which the Adjusted K&#8208;1s are issued.

&#160;

Under certain circumstances, the Funds may be required to pay withholding tax with respect to allocations to non&#8208;U.S. Shareholders. Although the Trust Agreement provides that any such withholding will be treated as being distributed to the non&#8208;U.S. Shareholder, the Funds may not be able to cause the economic cost of such withholding to be borne by the non&#8208;U.S. Shareholder on whose behalf such amounts were withheld since the Funds do not intend to make any distributions. Under such circumstances, the economic cost of the withholding may be borne by all Shareholders, not just the Shareholders on whose behalf such amounts were withheld. This could have a material impact on the value of your Shares.

&#160;

&#160;

The Trust has received an opinion of counsel that, under current U.S. federal income tax laws, each Fund, except TAGS, will be treated, and it is more likely than not that TAGS will be treated as a partnership that is not taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, provided that (i) at least 90 percent of the Fund&#8217;s annual gross income satisfies certain requirements regarding &#8220;qualifying income&#8221; as defined in the Code, (ii) the Fund is organized and operated in accordance with its governing agreements and applicable law, and (iii) the Fund does not elect to be taxed as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Although the Sponsor anticipates that each Fund has satisfied and will continue to satisfy the &#8220;qualifying income&#8221; requirement for all of its taxable years, that result cannot be assured. The Funds have not requested and will not request any ruling from the IRS with respect to its classification as a partnership not taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IRS were to successfully assert that the Funds are taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes in any taxable year, rather than passing through its income, gains, losses, and deductions proportionately to Shareholders, the Funds would be subject to tax on its net income for the year at corporate tax rates. In addition, although the Sponsor does not currently intend to make distributions with respect to Shares, any distributions would be taxable to Shareholders as dividend income to the extent of the Fund&#8217;s current and accumulated earnings and profits, then treated as a tax&#8208;free return of capital to the extent of the Shareholder&#8217;s basis in the Shares (and will reduce the basis), and, to the extent it exceeds a Shareholder&#8217;s basis in such Shares, as capital gain for Shareholders who hold their Shares as capital assets. Taxation of the Funds as a corporation could materially reduce the after&#8208;tax return on an investment in Shares and could substantially reduce the value of your Shares.

&#160;

There is very limited authority on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of bitcoin and no direct authority on bitcoin derivatives, such as Bitcoin Futures Contracts. Bitcoin Futures Contracts more likely than not will be considered futures with respect to commodities for purposes of the qualifying income exception under section 7704 of the Code. Based on a CFTC determination that treats bitcoin as a commodity under the CEA, the Fund intends to take the position that Bitcoin Futures Contracts consist of futures on commodities for purposes of the qualifying income exception under section 7704 of the Code. Shareholders should be aware that the Fund&#8217;s position is not binding on the IRS, and no assurance can be given that the IRS will not challenge the Fund&#8217;s position, or that the IRS or a court will not ultimately reach a contrary conclusion, which would result in the material adverse consequences to Shareholders and the Fund.

&#160;

Legislative, regulatory, or administrative changes could be enacted or promulgated at any time, either prospectively or with retroactive effect, and may adversely affect the Funds and their Shareholders. Please consult a tax advisor regarding the implications of an investment in Shares of the Teucrium Funds, including without limitation the federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences.

&#160;

Cybersecurity 

&#160;

The Funds and its service providers are susceptible to cyber security risks that include, among other things, theft, unauthorized monitoring, release, misuse, loss, destruction or corruption of confidential and highly restricted data; denial of service attacks; unauthorized access to relevant systems; compromises to networks or devices that the Funds and its service providers use to service the Fund&#8217;s operations; and operational disruption or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support the Funds and its service providers. Cyber-attacks against or security breakdowns of the Funds or its service providers may adversely impact the Funds and its shareholders, potentially resulting in, among other things, financial losses; the inability of Funds shareholders to transact business and the Funds to process transactions; the inability to calculate the Fund&#8217;s net asset value; violations of applicable privacy and other laws; regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs; and/or additional compliance costs. The Funds may incur additional costs for cyber security risk management and remediation purposes. There can be no assurance that the Funds or their service providers will not suffer losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches in the future.

&#160;

Risks Specific to the Teucrium Corn Fund 

&#160;

Investors may choose to use the Fund as a means of investing indirectly in corn, and there are risks involved in such investments. The risks and hazards that are inherent in corn production may cause the price of corn to fluctuate widely. Price movements for corn are influenced by, among other things: weather conditions, crop failure, production decisions, governmental policies, changing demand, the corn harvest cycle, and various economic and monetary events. Corn production is also subject to U.S. federal, state and local regulations that could materially affect operations.

&#160;

The price movements for corn are influenced by, among other things, weather conditions, crop disease, transportation difficulties, various planting, growing, and harvesting problems, governmental policies, changing demand, and seasonal fluctuations in supply. More generally, commodity prices may be influenced by economic and monetary events such as changes in interest rates, changes in balances of payments and trade, U.S. and international inflation rates, currency valuations and devaluations, U.S. and international economic events, and changes in the philosophies and emotions of market participants. Because the Fund invests primarily in interests in a single commodity, it is not a diversified investment vehicle, and therefore may be subject to greater volatility than a diversified portfolio of stocks or bonds or a more diversified commodity pool. Historically, price changes in corn have a low correlation with the S&#38;P 500. Historical performance is not indicative of future results and correlations may change.

&#160;

The Fund is subject to the risks and hazards of the corn market because it invests in Corn Interests. The risks and hazards that are inherent in the corn market may cause the price of corn to fluctuate widely. If the changes in percentage terms of the Fund&#8217;s Shares accurately track the percentage changes in the Benchmark or the spot price of corn, then the price of its Shares will fluctuate accordingly.

&#160;

The price and availability of corn is influenced by economic and industry conditions, including but not limited to supply and demand factors such as: crop disease and infestation (including, but not limited to, Leaf Blight, Ear Rot and Root Rot)&#894; transportation difficulties&#894; various planting, growing, or harvesting problems&#894; and severe weather conditions (particularly during the spring planting season and the fall harvest) such as drought, floods, or frost that are difficult to anticipate and which cannot be controlled. Demand for corn in the United States to produce ethanol has also been a significant factor affecting the price of corn. In turn, demand for ethanol has tended to increase when the price of gasoline has increased and has been significantly affected by United States governmental policies designed to encourage the production of ethanol. Additionally, demand for corn is affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional, and local economic conditions, and demographic trends. Finally, because corn is often used as an ingredient in livestock feed, demand for corn is subject to risks associated with the outbreak of livestock disease.

&#160;

Corn production is subject to United States federal, state, and local policies and regulations that materially affect operations. Governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry, such as taxes, tariffs, duties, subsidies, incentives, acreage control, and import and export restrictions on agricultural commodities and commodity products, can influence the planting of certain crops, the location and size of crop production, the volume and types of imports and exports, the availability and competitiveness of feedstocks as raw materials, and industry profitability. Additionally, corn production is affected by laws and regulations relating to, but not limited to, the sourcing, transporting, storing, and processing of agricultural raw materials as well as the transporting, storing, and distributing of related agricultural products. U.S. corn producers also must comply with various environmental laws and regulations, such as those regulating the use of certain pesticides, and local laws that regulate the production of genetically modified crops. In addition, international trade disputes can adversely affect agricultural commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions.

&#160;

&#160;

Seasonal fluctuations in the price of corn may cause risk to an investor because of the possibility that Share prices will be depressed because of the corn harvest cycle. In the United States, the corn market is normally at its weakest point, and corn prices are lowest, shortly before and during the harvest (between September and November), due to the high supply of corn in the market. Conversely, corn prices are generally highest during the winter and spring (between December and May), when farmer&#8208;owned corn has largely been sold and used. Seasonal corn market peaks generally occur around February or March. These normal market conditions are, however, often influenced by weather patterns, and domestic and global economic conditions, among other factors, and any specific year may not necessarily follow the traditional seasonal fluctuations described above. In the futures market, these seasonal fluctuations are typically reflected in contracts expiring in the relevant season (e.g., contracts expiring during the harvest season are typically priced lower than contracts expiring in the winter and spring). Thus, seasonal fluctuations could result in an investor incurring losses upon the sale of Fund Shares, particularly if the investor needs to sell Shares when the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts are, in whole or part, Corn Futures Contracts expiring in the fall.

&#160;

Demand for corn in the United States to produce ethanol has also been a significant factor affecting the price of corn. In turn, demand for ethanol has tended to increase when the price of gasoline has increased and has been significantly affected by United States governmental policies designed to encourage the production of ethanol. Additionally, demand for corn is affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional, and local economic conditions, and demographic trends. Finally, because corn is often used as an ingredient in livestock feed, demand for corn is subject to risks associated with the outbreak of livestock disease.

&#160;

The CFTC and U.S. designated contract markets, such as the CBOT, may establish position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control (other than as a hedge, which an investment by the Fund is not) may hold, own or control. For example, the current position limit for investments at any one time in the Corn Futures Contracts are 1,200 spot month contracts, 57,800 contracts expiring in any other single month, and 57,800 total for all months. These position limits are fixed ceilings that the Fund would not be able to exceed without specific CFTC authorization.

&#160;

All of these limits may potentially cause a tracking error between the price of the Shares and the Benchmark. This may in turn prevent you from being able to effectively use the Fund as a way to hedge against correlated losses or as a way to indirectly invest in corn.

&#160;

The Fund does not intend to limit the size of the offering and will attempt to expose substantially all of its proceeds to the corn market utilizing Corn Interests. If the Fund encounters position limits, accountability levels, or price fluctuation limits for Corn Futures Contracts on the CBOT, it may then, if permitted under applicable regulatory requirements, purchase Other Corn Interests and/or Corn Futures Contracts listed on foreign exchanges. However, the Corn Futures Contracts available on such foreign exchanges may have different underlying sizes, deliveries, and prices. In addition, the Corn Futures Contracts available on these exchanges may be subject to their own position limits and accountability levels. In any case, notwithstanding the potential availability of these instruments in certain circumstances, position limits could force the Fund to limit the number of Creation Baskets that it sells.

Risks Specific to the Teucrium Soybean Fund 

&#160;

Investors may choose to use the Fund as a means of investing indirectly in soybeans, and there are risks involved in such investments. The risks and hazards that are inherent in soybean production may cause the price of soybeans to fluctuate widely. Global price movements for soybeans are influenced by, among other things: weather conditions, crop failure, production decisions, governmental policies, changing demand, the soybean harvest cycle, and various economic and monetary events. Soybean production is also subject to domestic and foreign regulations that could materially affect operations.

&#160;

As discussed in more detail below, price movements for soybeans are influenced by, among other things, weather conditions, crop disease, transportation difficulties, various planting, growing, and harvesting problems, governmental policies, changing demand, and seasonal fluctuations in supply. More generally, commodity prices may be influenced by economic and monetary events such as changes in interest rates, changes in balances of payments and trade, U.S. and international inflation rates, currency valuations and devaluations, U.S. and international economic events, and changes in the philosophies and emotions of market participants. Because the Fund invests primarily in interests in a single commodity, it is not a diversified investment vehicle, and therefore may be subject to greater volatility than a diversified portfolio of stocks or bonds or a more diversified commodity pool.

&#160;

The Fund is subject to the risks and hazards of the soybean market because it invests in Soybean Interests. The risks and hazards that are inherent in the soybean market may cause the price of soybeans to fluctuate widely. If the changes in percentage terms of the Fund&#8217;s Shares accurately track the percentage changes in the Benchmark or the spot price of soybeans, then the price of its Shares will fluctuate accordingly.

&#160;

&#160;

The price and availability of soybeans is influenced by economic and industry conditions, including but not limited to supply and demand factors such as: crop disease&#894; weed control&#894; water availability&#894; various planting, growing, or harvesting problems&#894; severe weather conditions such as drought, floods, heavy rains, frost, or natural disasters that are difficult to anticipate and which cannot be controlled&#894; uncontrolled fires, including arson&#894; challenges in doing business with foreign companies&#894; legal and regulatory restrictions&#894; transportation costs&#894; interruptions in energy supply&#894; currency exchange rate fluctuations&#894; global trade disruption due to outbreaks&#894; and political and economic instability. Additionally, demand for soybeans is affected by changes in international, national, regional, and local economic conditions, and demographic trends. The increased production of soybean crops in South America and the rising demand for soybeans in emerging nations such as China and India have increased competition in the soybean market.

&#160;

Soybean production is subject to United States and foreign policies and regulations that materially affect operations. Governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry, such as taxes, tariffs, duties, subsidies, incentives, acreage control, and import and export restrictions on agricultural commodities and commodity products, can influence the planting of certain crops, the location and size of crop production, the volume and types of imports and exports, and industry profitability. Additionally, soybean production is affected by laws and regulations relating to, but not limited to, the sourcing, transporting, storing, and processing of agricultural raw materials as well as the transporting, storing, and distributing of related agricultural products. Soybean producers also may need to comply with various environmental laws and regulations, such as those regulating the use of certain pesticides. In addition, international trade disputes can adversely affect agricultural commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions.

&#160;

Because processing soybean oil can create trans&#8208;fats, the demand for soybean oil may decrease due to heightened governmental regulation of trans&#8208;fats or trans&#8208;fatty acids. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration currently requires food manufacturers to disclose levels of trans&#8208;fats contained in their products, and various local governments have enacted or are considering restrictions on the use of trans&#8208;fats in restaurants. Several food processors have either switched or indicated an intention to switch to oil products with lower levels of trans&#8208; fats or trans&#8208;fatty acids.

&#160;

In recent years, there has been increased global interest in the production of biofuels as alternatives to traditional fossil fuels and as a means of promoting energy independence. Soybeans can be converted into biofuels such as biodiesel. Accordingly, the soybean market has become increasingly affected by demand for biofuels and related legislation.

&#160;

The costs related to soybean production could increase and soybean supply could decrease as a result of restrictions on the use of genetically modified soybeans, including requirements to segregate genetically modified soybeans and the products generated from them from other soybean products.

&#160;

Seasonal fluctuations in the price of soybeans may cause risk to an investor because of the possibility that Share prices will be depressed because of the soybean harvest cycle. In the futures market, fluctuations are typically reflected in contracts expiring in the harvest season (i.e., contracts expiring during the fall are typically priced lower than contracts expiring in the winter and spring). Thus, seasonal fluctuations could result in an investor incurring losses upon the sale of Fund Shares, particularly if the investor needs to sell Shares when the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts are, in whole or part, Soybean Futures Contracts expiring in the fall.

&#160;

The increased production of soybean crops in South America and the rising demand for soybeans in emerging nations such as China and India have increased competition in the soybean market. Like the conversion of corn into ethanol, soybeans can be converted into biofuels such as biodiesel. Accordingly, the soybean market has become increasingly affected by demand for biofuels and related legislation. The supply of soybeans could be reduced by the spread of soybean rust, a wind&#8208;borne fungal disease. Although soybean rust can be killed with chemicals, chemical treatment increases production costs for farmers. Finally, because processing soybean oil can create trans&#8208;fats, the demand for soybean oil may decrease due to heightened governmental regulation of trans&#8208;fats or trans&#8208;fatty acids. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration currently requires food manufacturers to disclose levels of trans&#8208; fats contained in their products, and various local governments have enacted or are considering restrictions on the use of trans&#8208;fats in restaurants. Several food processors have either switched or indicated an intention to switch to oil products with lower levels of trans&#8208;fats or trans&#8208;fatty acids.

&#160;

The CFTC and U.S. designated contract markets, such as the CBOT, may establish position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control (other than as a hedge, which an investment by the Fund is not) may hold, own or control. For example, the current position limit for investments at any one time in the Soybean Futures Contracts are 1,200 spot month contracts, 27,300 contracts expiring in any other single month, and 27,300 total for all months. Soybean Swaps are subject to position limits that are similar to, but currently measured separately from, the limits on Soybean Futures Contracts. These position limits are fixed ceilings that the Fund would not be able to exceed without specific CFTC authorization.

&#160;

All of these limits may potentially cause a tracking error between the price of the Shares and the Benchmark. This may in turn prevent you from being able to effectively use the Fund as a way to hedge against soybean&#8208;related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in soybeans.

&#160;

If the Fund encounters position limits or price fluctuation limits for Soybean Futures Contracts on the CBOT, it may then, if permitted under applicable regulatory requirements, purchase Other Soybean Interests and/or Soybean Futures Contracts listed on foreign exchanges. However, the Soybean Futures Contracts available on such foreign exchanges may have different underlying sizes, deliveries, and prices. In addition, the Soybean Futures Contracts available on these exchanges may be subject to their own position limits or similar restrictions. In any case, notwithstanding the potential availability of these instruments in certain circumstances, position limits could force the Fund to limit the number of Creation Baskets that it sells.

Risks Specific to the Teucrium Sugar Fund 

&#160;

Investors may choose to use the Fund as a means of investing indirectly in sugar, and there are risks involved in such investments. The risks and hazards that are inherent in sugar production may cause the price of sugar to fluctuate widely. Global price movements for sugar are influenced by, among other things: weather conditions, crop failure, production decisions, governmental policies, changing demand, the sugar harvest cycle, and various economic and monetary events. Sugar production is also subject to domestic and foreign regulations that could materially affect operations.

&#160;

As discussed in more detail below price movements for sugar are influenced by, among other things, weather conditions, crop disease, transportation difficulties, various planting, growing, and harvesting problems, governmental policies, changing demand, and seasonal fluctuations in supply. More generally, commodity prices may be influenced by economic and monetary events such as changes in interest rates, changes in balances of payments and trade, U.S. and international inflation rates, currency valuations and devaluations, U.S. and international economic events, and changes in the philosophies and emotions of market participants. Because the Fund invests primarily in interests in a single commodity, it is not a diversified investment vehicle, and therefore may be subject to greater volatility than a diversified portfolio of stocks or bonds or a more diversified commodity pool.

&#160;

The Fund is subject to the risks and hazards of the world sugar market because it invests in Sugar Interests. The two primary sources for the production of sugar are sugarcane and sugar beets, both of which are grown in various countries around the world. The risks and hazards that are inherent in the world sugar market may cause the price of sugar to fluctuate widely. If the changes in percentage terms of the Fund&#8217;s Shares accurately track the percentage changes in the Benchmark or the spot price of sugar, then the price of its Shares will fluctuate accordingly.

&#160;

The global price and availability of sugar is influenced by economic and industry conditions, including but not limited to supply and demand factors such as: crop disease&#894; weed control&#894; water availability&#894; various planting, growing, or harvesting problems&#894; severe weather conditions such as drought, floods, or frost that are difficult to anticipate and which cannot be controlled&#894; uncontrolled fires, including arson&#894; challenges in doing business with foreign companies&#894; legal and regulatory restrictions&#894; fluctuation of shipping rates&#894; currency exchange rate fluctuations&#894; and political and economic instability. Global demand for sugar to produce ethanol has also been a significant factor affecting the price of sugar. Additionally, demand for sugar is affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional, and local economic conditions, and demographic trends. The spread of consumerism and the rising affluence of emerging nations such as China and India have created demand for sugar. An influx of people in developing countries moving from rural to urban areas may create more disposable income to be spent on sugar products and might also reduce sugar production in rural areas on account of worker shortages, all of which would result in upward pressure on sugar prices. On the other hand, public health concerns regarding obesity, heart disease and diabetes, particularly in developed countries, may reduce demand for sugar. In light of the time it takes to grow sugarcane and sugar beets and the cost of new facilities for processing these crops, it may not be possible to increase supply quickly or in a cost&#8208; effective manner in response to an increase in demand for sugar.

&#160;

Sugar production is subject to United States and foreign policies and regulations that materially affect operations. Governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry, such as taxes, tariffs, duties, subsidies, incentives, acreage control, and import and export restrictions on agricultural commodities and commodity products, can influence the planting of certain crops, the location and size of crop production, the volume and types of imports and exports, and industry profitability. Many foreign countries subsidize sugar production, resulting in lower prices, but this has led other countries, including the United States, to impose tariffs and import restrictions on sugar imports. Sugar producers also may need to comply with various environmental laws and regulations, such as those regulating the use of certain pesticides.

&#160;

Seasonal fluctuations in the price of sugar may cause risk to an investor because of the possibility that Share prices will be depressed because of the sugar harvest cycle. In the futures market, contracts expiring during the harvest season are typically priced lower than contracts expiring in the winter and spring. While the sugar harvest seasons varies from country to country, prices of Sugar Futures Contracts tend to be lowest in the late spring and early summer, reflecting the harvest season in Brazil, the world&#8217;s leading producer of sugarcane. Thus, seasonal fluctuations could result in an investor incurring losses upon the sale of Fund Shares, particularly if the investor needs to sell Shares when the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts are, in whole or part, Sugar Futures Contracts expiring in the late spring or early summer.

&#160;

The spread of consumerism and the rising affluence of emerging nations such as China and India have created demand for sugar. An influx of people in developing countries moving from rural to urban areas may create more disposable income to be spent on sugar products and might also reduce sugar production in rural areas on account of worker shortages, all of which could result in upward pressure on sugar prices. On the other hand, public health concerns regarding obesity, heart disease and diabetes, particularly in developed countries, may reduce demand for sugar. In light of the time it takes to grow sugarcane and sugar beets and the cost of new facilities for processing these crops, it may not be possible to increase supply quickly or in a cost&#8208;effective manner in response to an increase in demand.

&#160;

The CFTC and U.S. designated contract markets, such as the ICE Futures have established position limits and accountability levels on the maximum net long or net short Sugar Futures Contracts that any person or group of persons under common trading control may hold, own or control. For example, the current ICE Futures established position limit level for investments in Sugar No. 11 Futures Contracts for the spot month, which is defined as on and after the second business day following the expiration of the regular option contract traded on the expiring futures contract, is 5,000, the accountability level for investments in ICE Sugar No. 11 Futures Contracts for any one month is 10,000, and the accountability level for all combined months is 15,000. While accountability levels are not fixed ceilings, they are thresholds above which the exchange may exercise greater scrutiny and control over an investor, including limiting an investor to holding no more Sugar No. 11 Futures Contracts than the amount established by the accountability level. The Fund does not intend to invest in Sugar Futures Contracts in excess of any applicable accountability levels.

&#160;

All of these limits may potentially cause a tracking error between the price of the Shares and the Benchmark. This may in turn prevent you from being able to effectively use the Fund as a way to hedge against sugar&#8208;related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in sugar.

&#160;

If the Fund encounters accountability levels, position limits, or price fluctuation limits for Sugar Futures Contracts on ICE Futures, it may then, if permitted under applicable regulatory requirements, purchase Other Sugar Interests and/or Sugar Futures Contracts listed on the NYMEX or foreign exchanges. However, the Sugar Futures Contracts available on such foreign exchanges may have different underlying sizes, deliveries, and prices. In addition, the Sugar Futures Contracts available on these exchanges may be subject to their own position limits and accountability levels. In any case, notwithstanding the potential availability of these instruments in certain circumstances, position limits could force the Fund to limit the number of Creation Baskets that it sells.

Risks Specific to the Teucrium Wheat Fund 

&#160;

Investors may choose to use the Fund as a means of investing indirectly in wheat, and there are risks involved in such investments. The risks and hazards that are inherent in wheat production may cause the price of wheat to fluctuate widely. Price movements for wheat are influenced by, among other things: weather conditions, crop failure, production decisions, governmental policies, changing demand, the wheat harvest cycle, and various economic and monetary events. Wheat production is also subject to U.S. federal, state and local regulations that could materially affect operations.

&#160;

As discussed in more detail below, price movements for wheat are influenced by, among other things, weather conditions, crop disease, transportation difficulties, various planting, growing, and harvesting problems, governmental policies, changing demand, and seasonal fluctuations in supply. More generally, commodity prices may be influenced by economic and monetary events such as changes in interest rates, changes in balances of payments and trade, U.S. and international inflation rates, currency valuations and devaluations, U.S. and international economic events, and changes in the philosophies and emotions of market participants. Because the Fund invests primarily in interests in a single commodity, it is not a diversified investment vehicle, and therefore may be subject to greater volatility than a diversified portfolio of stocks or bonds or a more diversified commodity pool.

&#160;

The Fund is subject to the risks and hazards of the wheat market because it invests in Wheat Interests. The risks and hazards that are inherent in the wheat market may cause the price of wheat to fluctuate widely. If the changes in percentage terms of the Fund&#8217;s Shares accurately track the percentage changes in the Benchmark or the spot price of wheat, then the price of its Shares will fluctuate accordingly.

&#160;

The price and availability of wheat is influenced by economic and industry conditions, including but not limited to supply and demand factors such as: crop disease, weed control, water availability, various planting, growing, or harvesting problems, severe weather conditions such as drought, floods, or frost that are difficult to anticipate and which cannot be controlled. Demand for food products made from wheat flour is affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional, and local economic conditions, and demographic trends. More specifically, demand for such food products in the United States is relatively unaffected by changes in wheat prices or disposable income but is closely tied to tastes and preferences. Export demand for wheat fluctuates yearly, based largely on crop yields in the importing countries.

&#160;

Wheat production is subject to United States federal, state, and local policies and regulations that materially affect operations. Governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry, such as taxes, tariffs, duties, subsidies, incentives, acreage control, and import and export restrictions on agricultural commodities and commodity products, can influence the planting of certain crops, the location and size of crop production, the volume and types of imports and exports, the availability and competitiveness of feedstocks as raw materials, and industry profitability. Additionally, wheat production is affected by laws and regulations relating to, but not limited to, the sourcing, transporting, storing, and processing of agricultural raw materials as well as the transporting, storing, and distributing of related agricultural products. U.S. wheat producers also must comply with various environmental laws and regulations, such as those regulating the use of certain pesticides, and local laws that regulate the production of genetically modified crops. In addition, international trade disputes can adversely affect agricultural commodity trade flows by limiting or disrupting trade between countries or regions.

&#160;

Seasonal fluctuations in the price of wheat may cause risk to an investor because of the possibility that Share prices will be depressed because of the wheat harvest cycle. In the United States, the market for winter wheat, the type of wheat upon which CBOT Wheat Futures Contracts are based, is generally at its lowest point, and wheat prices are generally lowest, shortly before and during the harvest (in the spring or early summer), due to the high supply of wheat in the market. Conversely, winter wheat prices are generally highest in the fall or early winter when the wheat harvested that year has largely been sold and used. In the futures market, these seasonal fluctuations are typically reflected in contracts expiring in the relevant season (e.g., contracts expiring during the harvest season are typically priced lower than contracts expiring in the fall and early winter). Thus, seasonal fluctuations could result in an investor incurring losses upon the sale of Fund Shares, particularly if the investor needs to sell Shares when the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts are in whole or part, Wheat Futures Contracts expiring in the spring.

&#160;

&#160;

Demand for food products made from wheat flour is affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional, and local economic conditions, and demographic trends. More specifically, demand for such food products in the United States is relatively unaffected by changes in wheat prices or disposable income but is closely tied to tastes and preferences. For example, in recent years the increase in the popularity of low&#8208;carbohydrate diets caused the consumption of wheat flour to decrease rapidly before rebounding somewhat after 2005. Export demand for wheat fluctuates yearly, based largely on crop yields in the importing countries.

&#160;

Position limits and daily price fluctuation limits set by the CFTC and the exchanges have the potential to cause tracking error, which could cause the price of Shares to substantially vary from the Benchmark and prevent you from being able to effectively use the Fund as a way to hedge against wheat&#8208;related losses or as a way to indirectly invest in wheat.

&#160;

The CFTC and U.S. designated contract markets, such as the CBOT, may establish position limits on the maximum net long or net short futures contracts in commodity interests that any person or group of persons under common trading control (other than as a hedge, which an investment by the Fund is not) may hold, own or control. For example, the current position limit for investments at any one time in the Wheat Futures Contracts are 1,200 spot month contracts, 19,300 contracts expiring in any other single month, and 19,300 total for all months. Wheat Swaps are subject to position limits that are similar to, but currently measured separately from, the limits on Wheat Futures Contracts. These position limits are fixed ceilings that the Fund would not be able to exceed without specific CFTC authorization.

&#160;

If the Fund encounters position limits, accountability levels, or price fluctuation limits for Wheat Futures Contracts on the CBOT, it may then, if permitted under applicable regulatory requirements, purchase Other Wheat Interests and/or Wheat Futures Contracts listed on other U.S. exchanges or on foreign exchanges. However, the Wheat Futures Contracts available on such foreign exchanges may have different underlying sizes, deliveries, and prices. In addition, the Wheat Futures Contracts available on these exchanges may be subject to their own position limits and accountability levels. In any case, notwithstanding the potential availability of these instruments in certain circumstances, position limits could force the Fund to limit the number of Creation Baskets that it sells.

Our business and operations are subject to many risks. The risks described below, in addition to the risks described in &#8220;Item 1. Business&#8221; of this Annual Report, may not be the only risks we face, as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently believe are immaterial. You should carefully consider the following risk factors together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report, including the financial statements and related notes, when deciding to invest in us. You should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this Annual Report could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows and the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. 

Risks Related to Our Business

Oil, natural gas and NGL prices are volatile, due to factors beyond our control, and greatly affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any decline in, or sustained low levels of, oil, natural gas and NGL prices will cause a decline in our cash flow from operations, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our revenues, operating results, profitability, liquidity, future growth and the value of our assets depend primarily on prevailing commodity prices. Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, and other factors that are beyond our control, including:

##TABLE_START &#9679; the regional, domestic and foreign supply of oil, natural gas and NGLs; ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#9679; the level of commodity prices and expectations about future commodity prices; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; localized supply and demand fundamentals, including the proximity and capacity of pipelines and other transportation facilities, and other factors that result in differentials to benchmark prices from time to time; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; the cost of exploring for developing, producing and transporting reserves; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; the price and quantity of foreign imports, including volatility as a result of tariffs and other trade-related disputes; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; political and economic conditions in oil producing countries, including conflicts in or among the Middle East, Africa, South America, Russia and Israel; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; the ability of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (&#8220;OPEC&#8221;) to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; speculative trading in crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; the level of consumer product demand; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; weather conditions and other natural disasters; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; risks associated with a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; risks associated with operating drilling rigs; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; technological advances affecting exploration and production operations and overall energy consumption; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; the impact of energy conservation efforts; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine and ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, and the potential destabilizing effect such conflicts may pose for those regions and/or the global oil and natural gas markets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; the price and availability of competitors&#8217; supplies of oil and natural gas and alternative fuels; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; overall domestic and global economic conditions. ##TABLE_END 

These factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil, natural gas and NGL price movements with any certainty. For example, for the five years ended December 31, 2024, the NYMEX-WTI oil future price ranged from a high of $122.11 per Bbl to a low of $(37.63) per Bbl, while the NYMEX-Henry Hub natural gas future price ranged from a high of $9.68 per MMBtu to a low of $1.48 per MMBtu. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the WTI posted prices ranged from a high of $86.91 per Bbl on April 5, 2024 to a low of $65.75 per Bbl on September 10, 2024 and NYMEX-Henry Hub natural gas market price ranged from a high of $3.95 per MMBtu on December 24, 2024 to a low of $1.58 per MMBtu on February 15, 2024. Likewise, NGLs, which are made up of ethane, propane, isobutane, normal butane and natural gasoline, each of which has different uses and different pricing characteristics, have sustained depressed realized prices during this period and are generally correlated with the price of oil. A further or extended decline in commodity prices could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

If commodity prices decline for a prolonged period, a significant portion of our development projects may become uneconomic and result in write downs of the value of our oil and natural gas properties, which may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to fund our operations.

Oil, natural gas and NGL prices have experienced significant volatility over the past few years. An extended decline in commodity prices could render many of our development and production projects uneconomical and result in a downward adjustment of our reserve estimates, which would reduce our borrowing base and our ability to fund our operations.

No impairment expense was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. An extended decline in commodity prices may cause us to write down, as a non-cash charge to earnings, the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties for impairments. We may in the future incur impairment charges that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period taken and our ability to borrow funds under our Revolving Credit Facility.

Our business could be adversely affected by a decline in general economic conditions or a weakening of the broader energy industry, and inflation may adversely affect our financial position and operating results.

A prolonged economic slowdown or recession, adverse events relating to the energy industry, volatility due to tariffs or other trade-related disputes, or regional, national, or global economic conditions and factors, particularly a slowdown in the exploration and production industry, could negatively impact our operations and therefore adversely affect our results. The risks associated with our business are more acute during periods of economic slowdown or recession because such periods may be accompanied by decreased demand for oil and natural gas and decreased prices for oil and natural gas.

Inflationary factors, such as increases in the labor costs, material costs, and overhead costs, may also adversely affect our financial position and operating results. Inflation has also resulted in higher interest rates in the United States, which could increase our cost of debt borrowing in the future.

Loss of our key executive officers or other key personnel, or an inability to attract and retain such officers and personnel, could negatively affect our business.

Our future success depends on the skills, experience and efforts of our key executive officers. The sudden loss of any of these executives&#8217; services or our failure to appropriately plan for any expected key executive succession could materially and adversely affect our business and prospects, as we may not be able to find suitable individuals to replace them on a timely basis, if at all. Additionally, we also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business. If we fail to attract or retain talented new employees, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected. 

We may be unable to maintain compliance with the covenants in the Revolving Credit Facility, which could result in an event of default thereunder that, if not cured or waived, would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.

Under our Revolving Credit Facility, we are required to (i) maintain, as of the date of determination, a maximum total debt to EBITDAX ratio of 3.00 to 1.00, (ii) maintain a current ratio of not less than 1.00 to 1.00, and (iii) hedge at least 50% &#8722; 75% of our estimated production from total proved developed producing reserves. If we were to violate any of the covenants under our Revolving Credit Facility and were unable to obtain a waiver or amendment, it would be considered a default after the expiration of any applicable grace period. If we were in default under our Revolving Credit Facility, then the lenders may exercise certain remedies including, among others, declaring all borrowings outstanding thereunder, if any, immediately due and payable. This could adversely affect our operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations as they come due, because we might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments. In addition, our obligations under our Revolving Credit Facility are secured by mortgages on not less than 90% of the PV-9 value of our oil and gas properties together with all or substantially all material midstream assets necessary to operate our proved, developed and producing oil and gas properties, and if we are unable to repay our indebtedness under our Revolving Credit Facility, the lenders could seek to foreclose on our assets.

Restrictive covenants in our Revolving Credit Facility could limit our growth and our ability to finance our operations, fund our capital needs, respond to changing conditions and engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests.

Restrictive covenants in our Revolving Credit Facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. These restrictions limit our ability to, among other things:

##TABLE_START &#9679; incur additional liens; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; incur additional indebtedness; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; merge, consolidate or sell our assets; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our stock; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; make certain investments; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; enter into transactions with our affiliates. ##TABLE_END 

Our Revolving Credit Facility also requires us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants as discussed above. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our Revolving Credit Facility. If a default occurs and remains uncured or unwaived, the administrative agent or majority lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility may elect to declare all borrowings outstanding thereunder, if any, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. The administrative agent or majority lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility would also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. If we are unable to repay our indebtedness when due or declared due, the administrative agent will also have the right to proceed against the collateral pledged to it to secure the indebtedness under our Revolving Credit Facility. If such indebtedness were to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full our secured indebtedness.

We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants in our Revolving Credit Facility. The terms and conditions of our Revolving Credit Facility affect us in several ways, including:

##TABLE_START &#9679; requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our existing debt, thereby reducing the cash available to finance our operations and other business activities and could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; increasing our vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; limiting our ability to access the capital markets to raise capital on favorable terms or to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions or to refinance existing indebtedness; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; placing restrictions on our ability to obtain additional financing, make investments, lease equipment, sell assets and engage in business combinations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors with lower levels of indebtedness in relation to their overall size or less restrictive terms governing their indebtedness; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; limiting management&#8217;s discretion in operating our business. ##TABLE_END 

Our lenders periodically redetermine the amount we may borrow under our Revolving Credit Facility, which may materially impact our operations.

Our Revolving Credit Facility allows us to borrow in an amount up to the borrowing base, which is primarily based on the estimated value of our oil and natural gas properties and our commodity derivative contracts as determined semi-annually by our lenders in their sole discretion. The borrowing base is subject to redetermination on at least a semi-annual basis primarily based on an engineering report with respect to our estimated natural gas, oil and NGL reserves, which takes into account the prevailing natural gas, oil and NGL prices at such time, as adjusted for the impact of our commodity derivative contracts. Accordingly, declining commodity prices may have an impact on the amount we can borrow, which could affect our cash flows and ability to execute our business plans. Any material reduction in the borrowing base would materially and adversely affect our business and financing activities, limit our flexibility and management&#8217;s discretion in operating our business, and increase the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. In addition, as hedges roll off, the borrowing base is subject to further reduction. Our Revolving Credit Facility requires us to repay any deficiency over a certain period or pledge additional oil and gas properties to eliminate such deficiency within 30 days of notice. If our outstanding borrowings exceed the borrowing base and we are unable to repay the deficiency or pledge additional oil and gas properties to eliminate such deficiency, our failure to repay any of the installments due related to the borrowing base deficiency would constitute an event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility and as such, the lenders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, could freeze our accounts, or foreclose against the assets securing the obligations owed under our Revolving Credit Facility.

Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.

Borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at variable rates and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even if the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash available for servicing our indebtedness would decrease.

Our hedging strategy may not effectively mitigate the impact of commodity price volatility from our cash flows, and our hedging activities could result in cash losses and may limit potential gains.

We intend to maintain a portfolio of commodity derivative contracts covering at least 50%- 75% of our estimated production from proved developed producing reserves over a one-to-three-year period at any given point in time. These commodity derivative contracts include natural gas, oil and NGL financial swaps, put options, costless collars, and three-way collars. The prices and quantities at which we enter into commodity derivative contracts covering our production in the future will be dependent upon oil and natural gas prices and price expectations, at the time we enter into these transactions, which may be substantially higher or lower than current or future oil and natural gas prices. Accordingly, our price hedging strategy may not protect us from significant declines in oil, natural gas and NGL prices received for our future production. Many of the derivative contracts to which we will be a party will require us to make cash payments to the extent the applicable index exceeds a predetermined price, thereby limiting our ability to realize the benefit of increases in oil, natural gas and NGL prices. If our actual production and sales for any period are less than our hedged production and sales for that period (including reductions in production due to operational delays) or if we are unable to perform our drilling activities as planned, we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our hedging obligations without the benefit of the cash flow from our sale of the underlying physical commodity, which may materially impact our liquidity.

An increase in the differential between the NYMEX or other benchmark prices of oil and natural gas and the wellhead price we receive for our production could significantly reduce our cash flow and adversely affect our financial condition.

The prices that we receive for our oil and natural gas production often reflect a regional discount, based on the location of production, to the relevant benchmark prices, such as NYMEX or ICE, that are used for calculating hedge positions. The prices we receive for our production are also affected by the specific characteristics of the production relative to production sold at benchmark prices. For example, our California oil typically has a lower gravity, and a portion has higher sulfur content, than oil sold at certain benchmark prices. Therefore, because our oil requires more complex refining equipment to convert it into high value products, it may sell at a discount to those prices. These discounts, if significant, could reduce our cash flows and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Our estimated reserves and future production rates are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our estimated reserves.

It is not possible to measure underground accumulations of oil or natural gas in an exact way. The process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to current and future economic conditions and commodity prices. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect our estimated quantities and present value of our reserves.

In order to prepare our estimates, we must project production rates and timing of operating and development expenditures. We must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary.

The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as natural gas and oil prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures and availability of funds.

Actual future production, oil prices, natural gas prices, revenues, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable reserves will vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves. In addition, we may adjust our reserve estimates to reflect production history, results of development, existing commodity prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.

You should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our reserves is the current market value of our estimated reserves. We generally base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate.

Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The standardized measure of our estimated proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves.

The present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves shown in this report, or standardized measure, may not be the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves. In accordance with rules established by the SEC and the FASB, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the trailing 12-month average oil and gas index prices, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first-day-of-the-month price for each month and costs in effect on the date of the estimate, holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate, and future net present value estimates using then-current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements, which is required by the SEC and FASB, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the natural gas and oil industry in general.

The failure to replace our proved oil and natural gas reserves could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, production and cash flows.

Producing oil and natural gas reservoirs are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and therefore, our cash flows, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves. Our production decline rates may be significantly higher than currently estimated if our wells do not produce as expected. Further, our decline rate may change when we drill additional wells or make acquisitions. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at economically acceptable terms, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

If we reduce our capital spending in an effort to conserve cash, this would likely result in production being lower than anticipated, and could result in reduced revenues, cash flows from operations and income. Further, if the borrowing base under our Revolving Credit Facility decreases, or our revenues decrease, as a result of lower oil or natural gas prices or for any other reason, we may not be able to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations.

Developing and producing oil and natural gas are costly and high-risk activities with many uncertainties that may result in a total loss of investment or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our drilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that we will not discover commercially productive reservoirs. Drilling for oil and natural gas often involves unprofitable efforts, not only from dry holes, but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient oil or natural gas to return a profit at then-realized prices after deducting drilling, operating and other costs. The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or that it can be produced economically. The costs of our development and production activities are subject to numerous uncertainties beyond our control and increases in those costs can adversely affect the economics of a project. Further, our development and production operations may be curtailed, delayed, canceled or otherwise negatively impacted as a result of other factors, including:

##TABLE_START &#9679; high costs, shortages or delivery delays of rigs, equipment, labor, electrical power or other services; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; unusual or unexpected geological formations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; composition of sour natural gas, including sulfur, carbon dioxide and other diluent content; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; unexpected operational events and conditions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; failure of down hole equipment and tubulars; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; loss of wellbore mechanical integrity; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; failure, unavailability or shortage of capacity of gathering and transportation pipelines, or other transportation facilities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; human errors, facility or equipment malfunctions and equipment failures or accidents, including acceleration of deterioration of our facilities and equipment due to the highly corrosive nature of sour natural gas; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; title problems; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; loss of drilling fluid circulation; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; hydrocarbon or oilfield chemical spills; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; fires, blowouts, surface craterings and explosions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; surface spills or underground migration due to uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, formation water or well fluids; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with environmental and other governmental or regulatory requirements; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; adverse weather conditions and natural disasters. ##TABLE_END 

Additionally, our operations are subject to all of the hazards and operating risks associated with drilling for and production of oil and natural gas, including natural disasters, the risk of fire, explosions, blowouts, surface cratering, uncontrollable flows of natural gas, oil and formation water, pipe or pipeline failures, abnormally pressured formations, casing collapses and environmental hazards such as oil spills, natural gas leaks, ruptures or discharges of toxic gases, all of which could cause substantial financial losses. In addition, our operations are subject to risks associated with hydraulic fracturing, including any mishandling, surface spillage or potential underground migration of fracturing fluids, including chemical additives. The location of any properties and other assets near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could significantly increase the level of potential damages resulting from these risks. 

Any of these risks can cause substantial losses, including personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution, environmental contamination or loss of wells and other regulatory penalties. In the event that planned operations are delayed or canceled, or existing wells or development wells have lower than anticipated production due to one or more of the factors above or for any other reason, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. If any of these factors were to occur with respect to a particular field, we could lose all or a part of our investment in the field or we could fail to realize the expected benefits from the field, either of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Expenses not covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.

We maintain insurance coverage against potential losses that we believe is customary in the industry. However, insurance against all operational risk is not available to us. These insurance policies may not cover all liabilities, claims, fines, penalties or costs and expenses that we may incur in connection with our business and operations, including those related to environmental claims. Pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable. We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the perceived risks presented. A liability, claim or other loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

The production from our Bairoil properties could be adversely affected by the cessation or interruption of the supply of CO 2 to those properties.

We inject water and CO 2 into formations on substantially all of the Bairoil properties to increase production of oil and natural gas. The additional production and reserves attributable to the use of enhanced recovery methods are inherently difficult to predict. If we are unable to produce oil and gas by injecting CO 2 in the manner or to the extent that we anticipate, our future results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, our ability to utilize CO 2 to enhance production is subject to our ability to obtain sufficient quantities of CO 2 . If, under our CO 2 supply contracts, the supplier is unable to deliver its contractually required quantities of CO 2 to us, or if our ability to access adequate supplies is impeded, then we may not have sufficient CO 2 to produce oil and natural gas in the manner or to the extent that we anticipate, and our future oil and gas production volumes will be negatively impacted.

Many of our properties are in areas that may have been partially depleted or drained by offset wells.

Many of our properties are in areas that may have already been partially depleted or drained by earlier offset drilling. The owners of leasehold interests lying contiguous or adjacent to or adjoining any of our properties could take actions, such as drilling additional wells that could adversely affect our operations. When a new well is completed and produced, the pressure differential in the vicinity of the well causes the migration of reservoir fluids towards the new wellbore (and potentially away from existing wellbores). As a result, the drilling and production of these potential locations could cause a depletion of our proved reserves and may inhibit our ability to further exploit and develop our reserves.

Our expectations for future development activities are planned to be realized over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of such activities.

We have identified drilling, recompletion and development locations and prospects for future drilling, recompletion and development. These drilling, recompletion and development locations represent a significant part of our future drilling and enhanced recovery opportunity plans. We cannot predict in advance of drilling, testing and analysis of data whether any particular drilling location will yield production in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable. Even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas reserves exist, we may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well, possibly resulting in a reduction in production from the well or abandonment of the well. If we drill dry holes in our current and future drilling locations, our drilling success rate may decline and materially harm our business. Our ability to drill, recomplete and develop locations depends on a number of factors, including the availability of capital, seasonal conditions, regulatory approvals, negotiation of agreements with third parties, commodity prices, costs, the generation of additional seismic or geological information, the availability of drilling rigs, drilling results, construction of infrastructure and lease expirations. Because of these uncertainties, we cannot be certain of the timing of these activities or that they will ultimately result in the realization of estimated proved reserves or meet our expectations for success. As such, our actual drilling and enhanced recovery activities may materially differ from our current expectations, which could have a significant adverse effect on our estimated reserves, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Part of our strategy may involve using horizontal drilling and completion techniques, which involve risks and uncertainties in their application.

Our operations may involve utilizing some of the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by us and our service providers. Risks that we may face while drilling horizontal wells include, but are not limited to, the following:

##TABLE_START &#9679; landing our wellbore in the desired drilling zone; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; running our casing the entire length of the wellbore; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal wellbore. ##TABLE_END 

Risks that we may face while completing wells include, but are not limited to, the following:

##TABLE_START &#9679; the ability to fracture stimulate the target reservoir formation as planned, including the planned number of stages; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; the ability to run tools the entire length of the wellbore during completion operations; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; the ability to successfully clean out the wellbore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage. ##TABLE_END 

If our drilling results are less than anticipated, the return on our investment for a particular project may not be as attractive as we anticipated and we could incur material write-downs of unevaluated properties, and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.

Our potential use of 2-D and 3-D seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and natural gas, which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations.

Even when properly used and interpreted, 2-D and 3-D seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are, in fact, present in those structures. In addition, the use of 3-D seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies and we could incur losses as a result of such expenditures. As a result, future drilling activities may not be successful or economical, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

SEC rules could limit our ability to book additional PUDs in the future.

SEC rules require that, subject to limited exceptions, PUDs may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking. This requirement has limited and will likely continue to limit our ability to book additional PUDs, especially in a time of depressed commodity prices. Moreover, we may be required to write down our PUDs if we do not drill those wells within the required five-year timeframe.

The unavailability or high cost of rigs, equipment, supplies and crews could delay our operations, increase our costs and delay forecasted revenue.

Our industry is cyclical, and historically there have been periodic shortages of rigs, equipment, supplies and crew. Sustained declines in oil and natural gas prices may reduce the number of service providers for such rigs, equipment, supplies and crews, contributing to or resulting in shortages. Alternatively, during periods of higher oil and natural gas prices, the demand for rigs, equipment, supplies and crews is increased and can lead to shortages of, and increasing costs for, development equipment, supplies, services and personnel. Shortages of, or increasing costs for, experienced development crews and oil field equipment and services could restrict the Company&#8217;s ability to drill the wells and conduct the operations that it currently has planned relating to the fields where our properties are located. In addition, some of our operations require supply materials for production, such as CO 2 , which could become subject to shortages and increased costs. Any delay in the development of new wells or a significant increase in development costs could reduce our revenues and impact our development plan, which would thus affect our financial conduction, results of operations and our cash flows.

We may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest.

The existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. While we typically obtain title opinions prior to commencing drilling operations on a lease or in a unit, the failure of title may not be discovered until after a well is drilled, in which case we may lose the lease and the right to produce all or a portion of the minerals under the property.

Development and production of oil and natural gas in offshore waters have inherent and historically higher risk than similar activities onshore.

Our offshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks specific to the marine environment, such as a dependence on a limited number of electrical transmission lines, as well as capsizing, collisions and damage or loss from adverse weather conditions. Offshore activities are subject to more extensive governmental regulation than our other oil and natural gas activities. We are vulnerable to the risks associated with operating offshore Southern California, including risks relating to:

##TABLE_START &#9679; impacts of climate change and natural disasters such as earthquakes, tidal waves, mudslides, fires and floods; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; oil field service costs and availability; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; compliance with environmental and other laws and regulations; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; third-party marine vessels, including situations similar to the Incident; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; remediation and other costs resulting from oil spills, releases of hazardous materials and other environmental and natural resource damages; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; failure of equipment or facilities. ##TABLE_END 

In addition to lost production and increased costs, these hazards could cause serious injuries, fatalities, contamination or property damage for which we could be held responsible. The potential consequences of these hazards are particularly severe for us because significant portions of our offshore operations are conducted in environmentally sensitive areas, including areas with significant residential populations and public and commercial infrastructure. An accidental oil spill or release on or related to offshore properties and operations could expose us to joint and several strict liability, without regard to fault, under applicable law for all containment and oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages including, but not limited to, the costs of remediating a release of oil, natural resource damages, and economic damages suffered by persons adversely affected by an oil spill. If an oil discharge or substantial threat of discharge were to occur, we may be subject to regulatory scrutiny and liable for costs and damages, which costs and damages could be material to our business, financial condition or results of operations and could subject us to criminal and civil penalties. Finally, maintenance activities undertaken to reduce operational risks can be costly and can require exploration, exploitation and development operations to be curtailed while those activities are being completed.

Adverse developments in our operating areas could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our properties are located in the Rockies, federal waters offshore Southern California, East Texas / North Louisiana, Oklahoma and Eagle Ford. An adverse development in the oil and natural gas business of any of these geographic areas, such as in our ability to attract and retain field personnel or in our ability to comply with local regulations, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We are dependent upon a small number of significant customers for a substantial portion of our production sales. The loss of those customers, if not replaced, could reduce our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

We had three customers that each accounted for 10% or more of total reported revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024. The loss of these customers or any significant customer, should we be unable to replace them, could adversely affect our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Also, if any significant customer reduces the volume it purchases from us, we could experience a temporary interruption in sales of, or may receive a lower price for, our production, and our revenues and cash flows could decline. For instance, in October 2024, Phillips 66 announced its plan to cease operations at its Los Angeles area refinery in the fourth quarter of 2025. While we are actively engaging in discussions with Phillips 66 to understand the full scope of the impact on our business, this refinery has historically represented a significant portion of our sales to Phillips 66. We cannot assure you that any of our customers will continue to do business with us or that we will continue to have access to suitably liquid markets for our future production. See &#8220;Item 1. Business &#8212; Operations &#8212; Marketing and Major Customers.&#8221;

The inability of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us may adversely affect our financial results.

We are subject to credit risk due to concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables. The inability or failure of our significant customers, or any purchasers of our production, to meet their payment obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. To the extent that purchasers of our production rely on access to the credit or equity markets to fund their operations, there could be an increased risk that those purchasers could default in their contractual obligations to us. If for any reason we were to determine that it was probable that some or all of the accounts receivable from any one or more of the purchasers of our production were uncollectible, we would recognize a charge to earnings of that period for the probable loss and could suffer a material reduction in our liquidity and cash flows.

We are exposed to trade credit risk in the event of nonperformance by our vendors and other counterparties in the ordinary course of our business activities.

We are exposed to risks of loss in the event of nonperformance by our vendors and other counterparties. Some of our vendors and other counterparties may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks. Many of our vendors and other counterparties finance their activities through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. The combination of reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction in our vendors&#8217; and other counterparties&#8217; liquidity and ability to make payments or perform on their obligations to us. Even if our credit review and analysis mechanisms work properly, we may experience financial losses in our dealings with other parties. Any increase in the nonpayment or nonperformance by our vendors and/or counterparties could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We may be unable to compete effectively with larger companies.

The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive with respect to acquiring prospects and productive properties, marketing oil and natural gas and securing equipment and trained personnel. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. Many of our larger competitors not only drill for and produce oil and natural gas but also carry-on refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis and many of our competitors have access to capital at a lower cost than that available to us. These companies may be able to pay more for oil and natural gas properties and evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties than our financial, technical or personnel resources permit. In addition, there is substantial competition for investment capital in the oil and natural gas industry. These larger companies may have a greater ability to continue development activities during periods of low oil and natural gas prices and to absorb the burden of present and future federal, state, local and other laws and regulations. Furthermore, we may not be able to aggregate sufficient quantities of production to compete with larger companies that are able to sell greater volumes of production to intermediaries, thereby reducing the realized prices attributable to our production. Any inability to compete effectively with larger companies could have a material adverse impact on our business activities, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our business depends in part on pipelines, gathering systems and processing facilities owned by us or others. Any limitation in the availability of those facilities could interfere with our ability to market our oil and natural gas production.

The marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of pipelines and other transportation methods, gathering systems and processing facilities owned by third parties. The amount of oil and natural gas that can be produced and sold is subject to curtailment in certain circumstances, such as pipeline interruptions due to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, excessive pressure, physical damage or lack of contracted capacity on such systems. For example, our ability to produce and sell oil from the Beta properties will depend on the availability of the pipeline infrastructure between platforms as well as the San Pedro Bay Pipeline for delivery of that oil to shore, and any unavailability of that pipeline infrastructure or pipeline could cause us to shut in all or a portion of the production from the Beta properties for the length of such unavailability. Our access to transportation options can also be affected by U.S. federal and state regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation, general economic conditions and changes in supply and demand. The curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months. In many cases, we are provided with only limited, if any, notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration. Any significant curtailment in gathering system or transportation or processing facility capacity could reduce our ability to market our oil and natural gas production and harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate.

Some of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve third-party working interest owners. As a result, we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties, including compliance with environmental, safety and other regulations, or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties. Moreover, we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the capital expenditures of such projects. In addition, a third-party operator could also decide to shut-in or curtail production from wells, or plug and abandon marginal wells, on properties owned by that operator during periods of lower crude oil or natural gas prices. These limitations and our dependence on the operator and third-party working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs, lower production and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

We are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations.

Our oil and natural gas development and production operations are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations administered by governmental authorities vested with broad authority relating to the exploration for and the development, production and transportation of oil and natural gas. To conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental authorities. We may incur substantial costs in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations. Failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our operations, including any evolving interpretation and enforcement by governmental authorities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Our oil and natural gas development and production operations are also subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment, worker health and safety aspects of our operations, or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations applicable to our operations, including the acquisition of a permit before conducting regulated drilling activities; the restriction of types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment; the limitation or prohibition of drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, seismically active areas and other protected areas; the application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the EPA and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, often requiring difficult and costly compliance measures or corrective actions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed and, in some instances, the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. We may also experience delays in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits, which may delay or interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue. In addition, the long-term trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. Thus, our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations.

Under certain environmental laws that impose strict as well as joint and several liability, we may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations. Moreover, public interest in the protection of the environment has increased in recent years. New laws and regulations continue to be enacted, particularly at the state level, and, under the Biden Administration, the long-term trend of more expansive and stringent environmental legislation and regulations applied to the crude oil and natural gas industry could continue, resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting profitability. To the extent laws are enacted, or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and costly operating, waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements, our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

Further, the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended (the &#8220;Mineral Act&#8221;) prohibits ownership of any direct or indirect interest in federal onshore oil and natural gas leases by a foreign citizen or a foreign entity except through equity ownership in a corporation formed under the laws of the United States or of any U.S. State or territory, and only if the laws, customs, or regulations of their country of origin or domicile do not deny similar or like privileges to citizens or entities of the United States. If these restrictions are violated, the oil and natural gas lease can be canceled in a proceeding instituted by the United States Attorney General. We qualify as an entity formed under the laws of the United States or of any U.S. state or territory. Although the regulations promulgated and administered by the BLM pursuant to the Mineral Act provide for agency designations of non-reciprocal countries, there are presently no such designations in effect. It is possible that our stockholders may be citizens of foreign countries who do not own their stock in a U.S. corporation, or that even if such stock are held through a U.S. corporation, their country of citizenship may be determined to be non-reciprocal countries under the Mineral Act. In such event, any federal onshore oil and natural gas leases held by us could be subject to cancellation based on such determination.

See &#8220;Item 1. Business &#8212; Environmental, Occupational Health and Safety Matters and Regulations&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212; Other Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry&#8221; for a description of the more significant laws and regulations that affect us.

Our business is subject to climate-related transition risks, including fuel conservation measures, technological advances and increasing public attention to climate change and environmental matters, which could reduce demand for oil and natural gas and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and reputation.

Increased attention from governmental and regulatory bodies, investors, consumers, industry and other stakeholders on responding to climate change, together with fuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, and development of, and increased demand from consumers and industry for, lower-emission products and services (including electric vehicles and renewable residential and commercial power supplies) as well as more efficient products and services, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas (including wind, solar, nuclear, and geothermal sources as well as electric vehicles), societal expectations on companies to address climate change, investor and societal expectations regarding voluntary climate-related disclosures, and technological advances in fuel economy and energy transmission, storage, consumption and generation devices (including advances in wind, solar and hydrogen power, as well as battery technology), could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. Such initiatives or related activism aimed at responding to climate change and reducing air pollution, as well as negative investor sentiment toward our industry and the impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas services and products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and ability to access capital. 

The oil and natural gas industry, and energy industry more broadly, is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies. As others use or develop new technologies, including technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices or other technological advances that could reduce demand for oil and natural gas, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement new technologies at substantial costs. We may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. If one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Moreover, parties concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital, restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. Some investors, including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, university endowments and family foundations, have stated policies to disinvest in the oil and gas sector based on their social and environmental considerations. Certain investment banks and asset managers based both domestically and internationally have announced that they are adopting climate change guidelines for their banking and investing activities. Institutional lenders who provide financing to energy companies such as ours have also become more attentive to sustainable lending practices, and some may elect not to provide traditional energy producers or companies that support such producers with funding. Certain other stakeholders have also pressured commercial and investment banks to stop financing oil and gas production and related infrastructure projects. Such developments, including environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution, could result in downward pressure on the stock prices of oil and gas companies, including ours. This may also potentially result in a reduction of available capital funding or higher cost of capital for potential development projects, as well as the restriction, delay or cancellation of infrastructure projects and energy production activities, ultimately impacting our future financial results.

Negative public perception regarding us and/or our industry resulting from, among other things, concerns raised by advocacy groups about climate change, may also lead to increased litigation risk and regulatory, legislative, and judicial scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines and enforcement interpretations. In addition, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that GHG emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance or have caused other redressable injuries under federal and/or state common law. While our business is not a party to any such litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld, delayed, or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business. In addition, various officials and candidates at the federal, state and local levels, have made climate-related pledges or proposed banning hydraulic fracturing altogether. More broadly, the enactment of climate change-related policies and initiatives across the market at the corporate level and/or investor community level may in the future result in increases in the Company&#8217;s compliance costs and other operating costs and have other adverse effects (e.g., greater potential for governmental investigations or litigation). For further discussion regarding the transition risks posed to us by climate change-related regulations, policies and initiatives, see the discussion below in &#8220;&#8212;Climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of &#8220;greenhouse gases,&#8221; or GHGs, could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce, while the physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.&#8221;

Increasing scrutiny and changing stakeholder expectations in respect of environmental, social and governance (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) and sustainability practices may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation. 

Companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from a variety of stakeholders, including investor advocacy groups, proxy advisory firms, certain institutional investors and lenders, investment funds and other influential investors and rating agencies, related to their sustainability practices. If we do not adapt to or comply with investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards on sustainability matters as they continue to evolve, meet sustainability-related goals that we have set, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately or quickly enough to growing concern for sustainability issues, regardless of whether there is a regulatory or legal requirement to do so, we may suffer from reputational damage and our business, financial condition and/or stock price could be materially and adversely affected. 

In addition, the Company&#8217;s continuing efforts to research, establish, accomplish, and accurately report on the implementation of our sustainability strategy, including any specific sustainability objectives, may also create additional operational risks and expenses and expose us to reputational, legal, and other risks. While we create and publish voluntary disclosures regarding sustainability matters from time to time, some of the statements in those voluntary disclosures may be based on hypothetical expectations and assumptions that may or may not be representative of current or actual risks or events or forecasts of expected risks or events, including the costs associated therewith. Such expectations and assumptions are necessarily uncertain and may be prone to error or subject to misinterpretation given the long timelines involved and the lack of an established single approach to identifying, measuring, and reporting on many sustainability matters. Further, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to sustainability matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable sustainability ratings could lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward us and our industry and to the diversion of investment to other industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and costs of capital.

Our operations, projects and growth opportunities require us to have strong relationships with various key stakeholders, including our shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers, local communities and others. We may face pressure from stakeholders, many of whom are focused on climate change, to prioritize sustainable energy practices, reduce our carbon footprint and promote sustainability while at the same time remaining a successfully operating public company. If we do not successfully manage expectations across these varied stakeholder interests, it could erode stakeholder trust and thereby affect our brand and reputation. Such erosion of confidence could negatively impact our business through decreased demand and growth opportunities, delays in projects, increased legal action and regulatory oversight, adverse press coverage and other adverse public statements, difficulty hiring and retaining top talent, difficulty obtaining necessary approvals and permits from governments and regulatory agencies on a timely basis and on acceptable terms and difficulty securing investors and access to capital.

Climate change legislation or regulations pertaining to emissions of &#8220;greenhouse gases,&#8221; or GHGs, could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce, while the physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.

The EPA has adopted and implemented regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA. In addition, the EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources on an annual basis in the United States, including, among others, certain oil and natural gas production facilities, which includes certain of our operations. The adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations or could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. Such climate change regulatory and legislative initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In August 2022, then-President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Among other things, the Inflation Reduction Act includes a methane emissions reduction program that amends the CAA to include a Methane Emissions and Waste Reduction Incentive Program for petroleum and natural gas systems. This program requires the EPA to impose a &#8220;waste emissions charge&#8221; on certain oil and gas sources that are already required to report under EPA&#8217;s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. To implement the program, in May 2024, the EPA finalized revisions to the Greenhouse Gas reporting Program for petroleum and natural gas facilities. The emissions reported under the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program will be the basis for any payments under the Methane Emissions Reduction Program. However, petitions for reconsideration to the EPA are pending and litigation in the D.C. Circuit has commenced. In November 2024, the EPA finalized a regulation to implement the Inflation Reduction Act&#8217;s Waste Emissions Charge which became effective on January 1, 2025. The fee imposed under the Methane Emissions and Waste Reduction Incentive Program for 2024 is $900 per ton emitted over annual methane emissions thresholds, and increases to $1,200 in 2025, and $1,500 in 2026. However, in January 2025, President Trump issued an executive order directing the heads of all federal agencies to identify and begin the processes to suspend, revise, or rescind all agency actions that are unduly burdensome on the identification, development, or use of domestic energy resources. Consequently, future implementation and enforcement of these rules remain uncertain at this time. Additionally, many of the states have taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, including through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHGs cap and trade programs. For example, in October 2023, California enacted legislation that will ultimately require certain companies that (i) do business in California to publicly disclose their Scopes 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions, with third party assurance of such data, and issue public reports on their climate-related financial risk and related mitigation measures and (ii) operate in California and make certain climate-related claims to provide enhanced disclosures around the achievement of climate-related claims, including the use of voluntary carbon credits to achieve such claims. 

At the international level, in 2015, at COP21 the international community adopted the Paris Agreement, an international treaty aimed at addressing climate change whereby parties agreed to determine national contributions and set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. In February 2021, the prior Biden Administration announced reentry of the U.S. into the Paris Agreement along with a new &#8220;nationally determined contribution&#8221; for the U.S. GHG emissions that would achieve emissions reductions of at least 50% relative to 2005 levels by 2030. Pursuant to its obligations as a signatory to the Paris Agreement, the United States set a target to reduce its GHG emissions by 50-52% by the year 2030 as compared with 2005 levels. At COP28, nearly 200 countries, agreed to transition away from fossil fuels while accelerating action in this decade to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Additionally, at COP28, member countries entered into an agreement that calls for actions towards achieving, at a global scale, a tripling of renewable energy capacity and doubling energy efficiency improvements by 2030. The goals of the agreement, among other things, are to accelerate efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power, phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, and take other measures that drive the transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems. Most recently, at the COP29, delegates approved rules to operationalize international carbon markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, including a new Paris Agreement Crediting Mechanism to trade UN-approved carbon credits. Additionally, participants at COP29 representing 159 countries met to review progress toward the goals of the Global Methane Pledge and the addition of nearly $500 million in new grant funding for methane abatement. However, in January 2025, President Trump issued an executive order directing the immediate notice to the United Nations of the United States&#8217; withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and any similar commitment made under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Despite this, various states and local governments in the U.S. have vowed to continue to enact regulations to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement.

Additionally, on March 6, 2024, the SEC adopted the SEC Climate Rules. The SEC Climate Rules require registrants to include certain climate-related disclosures in their registration statements and periodic reports, including, but not limited to, information about material climate-related risks; the registrant&#8217;s governance of climate-related risks and relevant risk management processes; material climate-related targets and goals; and certain financial effects resulting from severe weather events and other natural conditions in a note to their audited financial statements (subject to de minimis thresholds). Larger registrants will also be required to disclose information about material Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions, which will be subject to a phased-in assurance requirement. However, the SEC voluntarily stayed the SEC Climate Rules in April 2024 pending judicial review of petitions challenging the rules. We are currently evaluating the impact of the SEC Climate Rules and there remains uncertainty as to whether these rules will withstand pending and future legal challenges.

Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions (including those related to carbon pricing schemes) would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations that require reporting of GHGs or otherwise limit emissions of GHGs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to monitor and report on GHG emissions or reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations, and such requirements also could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce and restrict our ability to execute on our business strategy, reducing our access to financial markets, or create greater potential for governmental investigations or litigation. 

Finally, most scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For example, such effects could adversely affect or delay demand for the oil or natural gas produced or cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to the effects of climatic events themselves. Potential adverse effects could include disruption of our production activities, increases in our costs of operation or reductions in the efficiency of our operations, impacts on our personnel, supply chain, or distribution chain, as well as potentially increased costs for insurance coverages in the aftermath of such effects. Our ability to mitigate the adverse physical impacts of climate change depends in part upon our disaster preparedness and response and business continuity planning. Further, energy needs could increase or decrease as a result of extreme weather conditions depending on the duration and magnitude of any such climate changes. Increased energy use due to weather changes may require us to invest in additional equipment to serve increased demand. A decrease in energy use due to weather changes may affect our financial condition through decreased revenues. The effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic oil and natural gas producing areas, which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effects of these conditions.

The listing of a species as either &#8220;threatened&#8221; or &#8220;endangered&#8221; under the federal Endangered Species Act could result in increased costs, new operating restrictions, or delays in our operations, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

The ESA and analogous state laws regulate activities that could have an adverse effect on threatened and endangered species. Operations in areas where threatened or endangered species or their habitat are known to exist may require us to incur increased costs to implement mitigation or protective measures and also may restrict or preclude our activities in those areas or during certain seasons, such as breeding and nesting seasons. The listing of species in areas where we operate or, alternatively, entry into certain range-wide conservation planning agreements could result in increased costs to us from species protection measures, time delays or limitations on our activities, which costs, delays or limitations may be significant and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. There is also increasing interest in nature-related matters beyond protected species, such as general biodiversity, which may similarly require us or our customers to incur costs or take other measures which may adversely impact our and our customers&#8217; business or operations.

The third parties on whom we rely for gathering and transportation services are subject to complex federal, state and other laws that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our business.

The operations of the third parties on whom we rely for gathering and transportation services are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations that require obtaining and maintaining numerous permits, approvals and certifications from various federal, state and local government authorities. These third parties may incur substantial costs in order to comply with existing laws and regulations. If existing laws and regulations governing such third-party services are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to their operations, these changes may affect the costs that we pay for such services. Similarly, a failure to comply with such laws and regulations by the third parties on whom we rely for gathering and transportation services could impact the availability of those services. Any potential impact to the availability of gathering and transportation services could impact our ability to market and sell our production, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See &#8220;Item 1. Business &#8212; Environmental, Occupational Health and Safety Matters and Regulations&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212; Other Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry&#8221; for a description of the laws and regulations that affect the third parties on whom we rely for gathering and transportation services.

Oil and natural gas producers&#8217; operations, especially those using hydraulic fracturing, are substantially dependent on the availability of water and the disposal of waste, including produced water and drilling fluids. Restrictions on the ability to obtain water or dispose of waste may impact our operations.

Water is an essential component of oil and natural gas production during the drilling, and in particular, hydraulic fracturing, process. Our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water or to dispose of or recycle water used in our development and production operations could adversely impact our operations. Moreover, the imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of natural gas. The Clean Water Act imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of produced waters and other natural gas and oil waste into &#8220;waters of the United States.&#8221; Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants to such waters and to conduct construction activities in such waters, which include certain wetlands. The Clean Water Act and similar state laws provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharges of pollutants and unauthorized discharges of reportable quantities of oil and other hazardous substances. State and federal discharge regulations prohibit the discharge of produced water and sand, drilling fluids, drill cuttings and certain other substances related to the natural gas and oil industry into coastal waters. Compliance with current and future environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells, and the disposal and recycling of produced water, drilling fluids, and other wastes, may increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted. In addition, in some instances, the operation of underground injection wells for the disposal of waste has been alleged to cause earthquakes. In some jurisdictions, such issues have led to orders prohibiting continued injection or the suspension of drilling in certain wells identified as possible sources of seismic activity or resulted in stricter regulatory requirements relating to the location and operation of underground injection wells. For example, we conduct oil and gas drilling and production operations in the Mississippian Lime formation in Oklahoma, a high-water play, which requires us to dispose of large volumes of saltwater generated as part of our operations. In 2015, the Oklahoma Geological Survey attributed an increase in seismic activity in Oklahoma to saltwater disposal wells in the Arbuckle formation. Around the same time, the OCC, whose Oil and Gas Conservation Division regulates oil and gas operations in Oklahoma, began issuing regulations targeting saltwater disposal activities in certain areas of interest within the Arbuckle formation. The regulations include operational requirements (i.e., mechanical integrity testing of wells permitted for disposal of 20,000 or more barrels of water per day, daily monitoring and recording of well pressure and discharge volume), as well as orders to shut-in wells, reduce well depths, or decrease disposal volumes. Under these regulations, the OCC ordered us to limit the volume of saltwater disposed of in saltwater disposal wells in the Arbuckle formation and established caps for ten of our saltwater disposal wells, which caps are still in place. To ensure that we had an adequate number of wells for disposal, we secured permits for additional saltwater disposal wells outside of the Arbuckle formation. We are currently in compliance with all OCC saltwater disposal requirements, and have maintained our production base without any negative material impact. However, any additional orders or regulations addressing concerns about seismic activity from well injection in jurisdictions where we operate could affect our operations. See &#8220;Item 1. Business &#8212; Environmental, Occupational Health and Safety Matters and Regulations &#8212; Water Discharges and Other Waste Discharges &#38; Spills&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212; Hydraulic Fracturing&#8221; for an additional description of the laws and regulations relating to the discharge of water and other wastes and hydraulic fracturing that affect us.

Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays and adversely affect our production.

Hydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice in the oil and gas industry used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves using water, sand and certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to allow flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. We routinely apply hydraulic fracturing techniques in our drilling and completion programs. While hydraulic fracturing has historically been regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, the practice has become increasingly controversial in certain parts of the country, resulting in increased scrutiny and regulation. See &#8220;Item 1. Business &#8212; Environmental, Health and Safety Matters and Regulations &#8212; Hydraulic Fracturing&#8221; for a description of the federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing that affect us.

If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted at the state and local level, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from dense subsurface rock formations and, in the event of prohibitions, may preclude our ability to drill wells. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing becomes further regulated at the federal level as a result of federal legislation or regulatory initiatives by the EPA or other federal agencies, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting requirements and result in permitting delays as well as potential increases in costs. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce from our reserves.

The cost of decommissioning is uncertain.

We are required to maintain reserve funds to provide for the payment of decommissioning costs associated with the Beta properties. The estimates of decommissioning costs are inherently imprecise and subject to change due to changing cost estimates, oil and natural gas prices and other factors. If actual decommissioning costs exceed such estimates, or we are required to provide a significant amount of additional collateral in cash or other security as a result of a revision to such estimates, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.

We are required to post cash collateral and may be in the future required to post additional collateral, pursuant to our agreements with sureties under our existing or future bonding arrangements, which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to execute our capital expenditure plan, our ARO plan and comply with our existing debt instruments.

Pursuant to the terms of our existing bonding arrangements with various sureties in connection with the decommissioning obligations related to our Beta properties, or under any future bonding arrangements we may enter into, we may be required to post additional collateral at any time, on demand, at the sureties&#8217; sole discretion. If additional collateral is required to support surety bond obligations, this collateral would probably be in the form of cash or letters of credit, certificate of deposit or other similar forms of liquid collateral. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to satisfy collateral demands for current bonds or for future bonds.

We entered into two escrow funding agreements with certain of our surety providers to fund interest-bearing escrow accounts to reimburse and indemnify the surety providers for any claims arising under the surety bonds related to the decommissioning of our Beta properties. If we fail to comply with our obligations under such escrow agreements, the surety providers may request additional collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit, certificates of deposit or other similar forms of liquid collateral. If we are required to provide additional collateral pursuant to any such request or otherwise, our liquidity position may be negatively impacted, and we may be required to seek alternative financing. To the extent we are unable to secure adequate financing, we may be forced to reduce our capital expenditures in the current year or future years, may be unable to execute our asset retirement obligation plan or may be unable to comply with our existing debt instruments. If we are unable or unwilling to provide additional collateral, we may have to pursue alternate bonding arrangements with other sureties. See Note 7, &#8220;Asset Retirement Obligations&#8221; and Note 18, &#8220;Commitments and Contingencies &#8212; Supplemental Bond for Decommissioning Liabilities Trust Agreement&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,&#8221; in this Annual Report for additional information.

Certain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and production may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.

In past years, legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws, including the elimination of certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, or IDCs, (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. Although these provisions were largely unchanged by the Tax Act, Congress could consider and could include some or all of these proposals as part of future tax reform legislation. It is unclear whether any of the foregoing or similar proposals will be considered and enacted as part of future tax reform legislation and if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development and any such change could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Our business could be negatively affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, destructive forms of protest and opposition by activists and other disruptions.

As an oil and natural gas producer, we face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, to misappropriate financial assets or to render data or systems unusable; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third-party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines; and threats from terrorist acts. The potential for such security threats has subjected our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. If any of these security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of financial assets, sensitive information, critical infrastructure or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are becoming more sophisticated and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and systems, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corruption of data. These events could lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability. In addition, destructive forms of protest and opposition by activists and other disruptions, including acts of sabotage or eco-terrorism, against oil and gas production and activities could potentially result in damage or injury to people, property or the environment or lead to extended interruptions of our operations, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations.

We may be subject to increased permitting obligations and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the Incident. 

The Incident may result in more stringent permitting obligations and regulation of our properties and other oil and gas activities, including at Beta and elsewhere, particularly relating to environmental, health and safety protection controls, oversight of oil and gas operations and required financial assurance. Regulatory or legislative action may impact the industry as a whole and could be directed specifically towards operators similarly situated to us, which could negatively impact our business.

Additionally, new regulations and legislation, as well as evolving practices, may increase the cost of compliance, require changes to our operations and strategic plans and impact our ability to capitalize on our assets.

Risks Related to the Mergers

The Mergers are subject to closing conditions and may not be completed, the Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms, and we may be required to pay a termination fee or reimburse expenses upon termination. 

The Mergers are subject to customary closing conditions that must be satisfied or waived prior to the completion of the Mergers, including the approval by our stockholders of the Stock Issuance Proposal and other customary closing conditions. Many of the closing conditions are not within our control. No assurance can be given that our stockholder approval will be obtained or that the required conditions to the Closing will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all. Any delay in completing the Mergers could cause the combined company not to realize, or to be delayed in realizing, some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the Mergers are successfully completed within the expected time frame.

Additionally, either party may terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, including, among other reasons, if the Mergers are not completed by July 14, 2025. In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, we may be obligated to pay a termination fee of $8,500,000 or to reimburse the Acquired Companies for certain of their transaction expenses in an amount of up to $800,000. 

Moreover, if the Mergers are not completed for any reason, including because stockholder approval of the Stock Issuance Proposal is not obtained, our ongoing businesses may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the expected benefits of having completed the Mergers, we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:

##TABLE_START &#9679; we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on our stock price&#894; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; we may experience negative reactions from our customers, suppliers, distributors and employees&#894; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; we will be required to pay our costs relating to the Mergers, such as financial advisory, legal, financing and accounting costs and associated fees and expenses, whether or not the Mergers are completed&#894; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; the market price of our Common Stock could decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Mergers will not be completed; ##TABLE_END

##TABLE_START &#9679; the Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completion of the Mergers and such restrictions, the waiver of which are subject to the consent of the Acquired Companies, may prevent us from taking actions during the pendency of the Mergers that would be beneficial&#894; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; matters relating to the Mergers (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by management, which could otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations or to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us as an independent company. ##TABLE_END 

The consideration payable under the Merger Agreement is fixed and will not be adjusted based on our performance. 

Under the Merger Agreement, the total consideration payable by us consists of 26,729,315 shares of Common Stock. The purchase price will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of our Common Stock or the economic performance of Amplify Energy or either of the Acquired Companies. If the market price of our Common Stock increases or the economic performance of the Acquired Companies relative to us improves, the consideration will not be adjusted to account for any such changes or any effective increase or decrease in the value of the Aggregate Merger Consideration issued or paid to Juniper (and/or its affiliates) under the Merger Agreement.

We will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions, including the risk of litigation, while the Mergers are pending that may cause disruption and may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, suppliers or customers. 

Uncertainty about the effect of the Mergers on employees, suppliers and customers may have an adverse effect on Amplify Energy and/or the Acquired Companies, which uncertainties may impair our or the Acquired Companies&#8217; ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Mergers are completed and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause customers, suppliers and others that deal with Amplify Energy or the Acquired Companies to seek to change existing business relationships with us or the Acquired Companies.

Employee retention and recruitment may be challenging before the completion of the Mergers, as employees and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles following the Mergers. Key employees may depart or prospective key employees may fail to accept employment with us or the Acquired Companies because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company following the Mergers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The pursuit of the Mergers and the preparation for the integration may place a significant burden on management and internal resources. The diversion of management&#8217;s attention away from day-to-day business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Until the completion of the Mergers or the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, we are prohibited from entering into certain transactions and taking certain actions that might otherwise be beneficial to us and our stockholders. 

During the period between the date of the Merger Agreement and completion of the Mergers (or earlier termination of the Merger Agreement), the Merger Agreement restricts us from taking specified actions or from pursuing what might otherwise be attractive business opportunities or making other changes to our business, in each case without the consent of the Acquired Companies. These restrictions may prevent us from taking actions during the pendency of the Mergers that would have been beneficial. Adverse effects arising from these restrictions during the pendency of the Mergers could be exacerbated by any delays in consummation of the Mergers or termination of the Merger Agreement.

The Merger Agreement limits our ability to pursue alternatives to the Mergers and may discourage a potential competing acquirer of Amplify Energy, including the payment by Amplify Energy of a termination fee. 

The Merger Agreement contains provisions that, subject to limited exceptions, restrict our ability to, among other things, directly or indirectly (i) initiate, solicit, propose, seek or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate (including by furnishing or providing information) any inquiries, proposals, or offers regarding, or the making of a Parent Alternative Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement); (ii) enter into, participate in or engage in any discussions or negotiations with respect to a Parent Alternative Proposal; (iii) furnish any information or afford access to our properties, assets or employees, in each case, in connection with or in response to a Parent Alternative Proposal; (iv) enter into any letter of intent or agreement in principle, or any other agreement providing for a Parent Alternative Proposal (other than certain permitted confidentiality agreements); (v) waive or release any person from, forbear in the enforcement of, or amend any standstill agreement or any standstill provisions of any other contract; (vi) take any action to make any &#8220;moratorium,&#8221; &#8220;control share acquisition,&#8221; &#8220;fair price,&#8221; &#8220;supermajority,&#8221; &#8220;affiliate transactions&#8221; or &#8220;business combination statute or regulation&#8221; or other similar takeover laws, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, inapplicable to any person or a Parent Alternative Proposal or (vii) resolve, agree, or publicly propose to take any of the foregoing actions. Further, even if the Board withdraws, modifies, or qualifies its recommendation with respect to the Stock Issuance Proposal, unless the Merger Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, Amplify Energy will still be required to submit the Stock Issuance Proposal to a vote at our special meeting. In addition, the Acquired Companies generally have an opportunity to offer to modify the terms of the Mergers in response to any third-party alternative transaction proposal before the Board may withdraw, modify or qualify its recommendation with respect to the Stock Issuance Proposal. In certain circumstances, upon termination of the Merger Agreement, we will be required to pay the Acquired Companies a termination fee equal to $8,500,000. In addition, unless otherwise entitled to the termination fee, we may be obligated to pay the Acquired Companies an expense reimbursement fee up to $800,000 if the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances.

These provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant portion of us from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay above market value, or might otherwise result in a potential third-party acquirer proposing to pay a lower price to Amplify Energy stockholders than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances.

If the Merger Agreement is terminated and we decide to seek another merger transaction, we may not be able to negotiate or consummate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the Merger Agreement.

Affiliates of Amplify Energy may have interests in the Mergers that are different from, or in addition to, the interests of Amplify Energy&#8217;s other stockholders. 

Our officers and directors may have interests in the Mergers that are different from, or in addition to (and which may conflict with) your interests. These interests include, among other things, the expected continued employment and directorship of Martyn Willsher as chief executive officer of Amplify Energy, and the expected continued service of Christopher W. Hamm as the Chairman of the Board until such time as the Board shall vote to elect a different chairperson by a majority vote of the Board. Our Board was aware of and considered these interests, among other matters, in evaluating the Mergers, the Merger Agreement and certain other related agreements in connection with the Mergers in recommending to our stockholders that they vote in favor of the proposals presented at the Special Meeting. 

Current Amplify Energy stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in Amplify Energy after the Mergers compared to their current ownership and will exercise less influence over management. 

Based on the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of January 14, 2025, it is expected that, on a fully-diluted basis, current Amplify Energy stockholders will collectively own approximately 61%, and Juniper and its affiliates will collectively own approximately 39%, of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the combined company&#8217;s outstanding equity. As a result of the Mergers, current Amplify Energy stockholders will own a smaller percentage of the combined company than they currently own of Amplify Energy, and as a result will have less influence on the management and policies of Amplify Energy post-Mergers than they now have on the management and policies of Amplify Energy, as the case may be.

The Mergers will involve substantial costs. 

We have incurred and expect to incur non-recurring costs associated with the Mergers and combining the operations of the companies, as well as transaction fees and other costs related to the Mergers. These costs and expenses include fees paid to legal, financial and accounting advisors, regulatory and public relations advisors, filing fees, printing costs and other costs and expenses. A significant portion of these transaction costs is contingent upon the Closing occurring, although some have been and will be incurred regardless of whether the Mergers are consummated.

In addition, the combined company may incur significant restructuring and integration costs in connection with the integration of Amplify Energy and the Acquired Companies and the execution of our business plan, including costs relating to formulating and implementing integration plans and eliminating duplicative costs. The costs related to restructuring will be expensed as a cost of the ongoing results of operations of either us or the combined company. There are processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated in connection with the Mergers and the integration of each of the Acquired Companies&#8217; businesses. While we have assumed a certain level of expenses would be incurred to integrate Amplify Energy and the Acquired Companies and achieve synergies and efficiencies and we continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, many of these expenses are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately, and there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or timing of these costs. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of strategic benefits, additional income, synergies and other efficiencies should allow the combined company to offset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.

Securities class action and derivative lawsuits may be filed against us, or against our directors, challenging the Mergers, and an adverse ruling in any such lawsuit may prevent the Mergers from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the expected time frame. 

Securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against public companies that have entered into acquisition, merger or other similar agreements. Mergers like the Mergers are frequently subject to litigation or other legal proceedings, including actions alleging that our Board breached their fiduciary duties to our stockholders by entering into the Merger Agreement. We cannot provide assurance that such litigation or other legal proceedings will not be brought. If litigation or other legal proceedings are in fact brought against us, or against our Board, we will defend against it, but might not be successful in doing so. An adverse outcome in such matters, as well as the costs and efforts of a defense even if successful, could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operation or financial position of us or the combined company, including through the possible diversion of company resources or distraction of key personnel.

Lawsuits that may be brought against us, the Acquired Companies or our or their directors could also seek, among other things, injunctive relief or other equitable relief, including a request to enjoin us from consummating the Mergers. One of the conditions to the Closing are that no order, award or judgment by any court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction has been entered and continues to be in effect and no law has been adopted or is effective, in either case, that prohibits or makes illegal the Closing. Consequently, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an order, award or judgment prohibiting completion of the Mergers, that order, award or judgment may delay or prevent the Mergers from being completed within the expected time frame or at all, which may adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.

We expect to refinance substantial indebtedness of the Acquired Companies in connection with the Mergers, which combined with our current debt may limit our financial flexibility and adversely affect our financial results. 

In connection with the Mergers, Amplify Energy expects to refinance a substantial portion of its outstanding debt and approximately $133 million in principal amount of the Acquired Companies&#8217; outstanding debt. There is no guarantee that Amplify Energy will be able to execute the refinancing on favorable terms or at all. If Amplify Energy is unable to refinance the debt on favorable terms, its financial condition could be adversely affected. If Amplify Energy is unable to complete a sufficient refinancing at all, it may not be able to complete the Mergers.

In addition, if Amplify Energy is able to execute the refinancing, the combined company&#8217;s level of indebtedness following the completion of the Mergers could have important consequences. For example, it could:

##TABLE_START &#9679; increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; impair our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, development of estimated proved undeveloped reserves, development and acquisition projects, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; require us to dedicate a material portion of our cash flows to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, development of estimated PUDs, development and acquisition projects, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; expose us to variable interest rate risk to the extent of any borrowings under our existing and any assumed credit facilities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions. ##TABLE_END 

Any of these risks could materially impact our ability to fund our operations or limit our ability to expand the combined business, which could have a material adverse effect on the combined company, its financial condition and results of operations.

Combining the businesses of Amplify Energy, NPOG and COG may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected and the combined company may fail to realize the anticipated synergies and other benefits of the Mergers, which may adversely affect the combined company&#8217;s business results and negatively affect the value of our Common Stock following the consummation of the Mergers. 

Amplify Energy and each of the Acquired Companies have operated and, until the completion of the Mergers will continue to operate, independently. The success of the Mergers will depend on, among other things, the ability of Amplify Energy and the Acquired Companies to combine their businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes expected cost savings. We have entered into the Merger Agreement because we believe that the mergers contemplated by the Merger Agreement are fair to and in the best interests of our stockholders and that combining the businesses of Amplify Energy and the Acquired Companies will produce benefits as well as cost savings and other cost and capital expenditure synergies.

Following the Closing, Amplify Energy and the Acquired Companies must successfully combine their respective businesses in a manner that permits these benefits to be realized. For example, the following issues, among others, must be addressed in integrating the operations of the companies in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the Mergers:

##TABLE_START &#9679; combining the companies&#8217; operations and corporate functions&#894; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; combining the businesses of Amplify Energy and the Acquired Companies and meeting the capital requirements of the combined company, in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve any cost savings or other synergies anticipated to result from the Mergers, the failure of which would result in the anticipated benefits of the Mergers not being realized in the time frame currently anticipated or at all&#894; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; integrating personnel from the companies&#894; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; integrating and unifying our reserves and the development of our new PUDs&#894; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; identifying and eliminating underperforming or uncertain wells&#894; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; harmonizing the companies&#8217; operating practices, employee development and compensation programs, internal controls and other policies, procedures and processes&#894; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; maintaining existing agreements with customers, suppliers, distributors and vendors, avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective customers, suppliers, distributors and vendors, and leveraging relationships with such third parties for the benefit of the combined company&#894; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies&#894; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; consolidating the companies&#8217; administrative and information technology infrastructure&#894; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; coordinating distribution and marketing efforts&#894; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; effecting actions that may be required in connection with obtaining regulatory or other governmental approvals. ##TABLE_END 

It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees of Amplify Energy or the Acquired Companies, the loss of customers, the disruption of either Amplify Energy&#8217;s or the Acquired Companies&#8217; ongoing businesses, inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. In addition, the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses. If the combined company is not able to adequately address integration challenges, we may be unable to successfully integrate operations and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized.

In addition, the combined company must achieve the anticipated growth and cost savings without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth. If the combined company is not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated synergies and other benefits of the Mergers may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Additionally, we may inherit from the Acquired Companies legal, regulatory, and other risks that occurred prior to the Mergers, whether known or unknown to us, which may be material to the combined company. Actual growth, cost and capital expenditure synergies and other cost savings, if achieved, may be lower than what we expect and may take longer to achieve than anticipated. Moreover, at times the attention of the combined company&#8217;s management and resources may be focused on the integration of the businesses of the company and diverted from day-to-day business operations or other opportunities that may have been beneficial to such company, which may disrupt the combined company&#8217;s ongoing businesses.

An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the Mergers, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect upon the revenues, level of expenses and operating results of the combined company, which may adversely affect the value of our Common Stock following the consummation of the Mergers. Moreover, if the combined company is unable to realize the full strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Mergers, Amplify Energy stockholders will have experienced substantial dilution of their ownership interests without receiving any commensurate benefit, or only receiving part of the commensurate benefit to the extent the combined company is able to realize only part of the strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Mergers.

The combined company may not be able to retain customers, suppliers or distributors, or customers, suppliers or distributors may seek to modify contractual relationships with the combined company, which could have an adverse effect on the combined company&#8217;s business and operations. Third parties may terminate or alter existing contracts or relationships with the combined company. 

As a result of the Mergers, the combined company may experience impacts on relationships with customers, suppliers and distributors that may harm the combined company&#8217;s business and results of operations. Certain customers, suppliers or distributors may seek to terminate or modify contractual obligations following the Mergers whether or not contractual rights are triggered as a result of the Mergers. There can be no guarantee that customers, suppliers and distributors will remain with or continue to have a relationship with the combined company or do so on the same or similar contractual terms following the Mergers. If any customers, suppliers or distributors seek to terminate or modify contractual obligations or discontinue the relationship with the combined company, then the combined company&#8217;s business and results of operations may be harmed. If the combined company&#8217;s suppliers were to seek to terminate or modify an arrangement with the combined company, then the combined company may be unable to procure necessary supplies from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all.

We and each of the Acquired Companies also have contracts with third parties which may require consent from these parties in connection with the Mergers, or which may otherwise contain limitations applicable to such contracts following the Mergers. If these consents cannot be obtained, the combined company may suffer a loss of potential future revenue, incur costs and lose rights that may be material to the combined company&#8217;s business. In addition, third parties with whom we or either of the Acquired Companies currently have relationships may terminate or otherwise reduce the scope of their relationship in anticipation of the Mergers. Any such disruptions could limit the combined company&#8217;s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Mergers. The adverse effect of any such disruptions could also be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the Mergers or by a termination of the Merger Agreement.

The Acquired Companies are currently not U.S. public reporting companies, and the obligations associated with integrating into a public company may require significant resources and management attention. 

The Acquired Companies are, and prior to the consummation of the Mergers will remain, private companies that are not subject to reporting requirements and do not have accounting personnel specifically employed to review internal controls over financial reporting. Upon completion of the Mergers, the Acquired Companies will become subject to the rules and regulations established from time to time by the SEC and NYSE. In addition, as a public company, we are required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, so that our management can certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in connection with the annual report. The Acquired Companies are required to be included in the scope of our internal control over financial reporting in the annual report to be filed with the SEC for the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the Mergers are consummated and thereafter, which requires us to make and document significant changes to our internal controls over financial reporting. Bringing the Acquired Companies into compliance with these rules and regulations and integrating the Acquired Companies into our current compliance and accounting system may increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. Furthermore, the need to establish the necessary corporate infrastructure to integrate the Acquired Companies may divert management&#8217;s attention from implementing our growth strategy, which could prevent us from improving our business, financial condition and results of operations. However, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company. If we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our changing enterprise upon the Mergers and maintain our culture, our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur to bring the Acquired Companies into compliance with these requirements. We anticipate that these costs will materially increase our general and administration expenses. In addition, bringing the Acquired Companies into compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly. These additional obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.

Risks Related to the Company&#8217;s Business and Industry 

The Company&#8217;s business has in the past and could in the future be adversely affected by declines in construction, material handling, and environmental processing activities, or a downturn in the economy in general, which could lead to decreased demand for equipment, depressed equipment rental rates, and lower sales prices, resulting in a decline in the Company&#8217;s revenues, gross margins, and operating results. 

The Company&#8217;s equipment is principally used in connection with construction, material handling, and environmental processing activities. Consequently, a downturn in these activities, or the economy in general, has in the past and may in the future lead to a decrease in the demand for equipment and services or depress rental rates and the sales prices for the Company&#8217;s replacement parts, services, and equipment. The Company&#8217;s business has in the past and may in the future be negatively impacted, either temporarily or long-term, by: 

&#8226; a reduction in spending levels by our customers; 

&#8226; the lack of availability of credit for our customers; 

&#8226; adverse changes in federal, state, and local government infrastructure spending and taxation; 

&#8226; excess supply in the equipment markets we participate in; 

&#8226; our inability to pass along operating cost increases related to inflation or otherwise to customers; 

&#8226; an increase in costs generally, including the cost of inputs for our OEMs or customers' operations, as a result of tariffs, inflation or other factors; 

&#8226; adverse weather conditions or natural disasters which may affect a particular region; 

&#8226; a pandemic or similar national or global health crisis; 

&#8226; a labor work stoppage or shortage of skilled technicians; 

&#8226; labor market conditions in the U.S. or Canada that would impair the Company&#8217;s, our OEM&#8217;s, or our customers&#8217; ability to hire and/or retain appropriately skilled employees to support ongoing operations; 

&#8226; a prolonged shutdown of the U.S., state or local government; 

&#8226; an increase in interest rates; 

&#8226; adverse foreign currency fluctuations; 

&#8226; terrorism, war or hostilities involving the U.S. or Canada; 

&#8226; our failure to execute on strategic plans generally, including those associated with commercial electric vehicle business model; 

&#8226; disruptions to global supply chains, specifically our major OEM partner supply chains; or 

&#8226; other unforeseen or catastrophic events. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s inability to forecast trends accurately may adversely impact the Company&#8217;s business and financial condition. 

An economic downturn or economic uncertainty makes it difficult for the Company to forecast trends, which may have an adverse impact on the Company&#8217;s business and financial condition. Uncertainty regarding future equipment demand could cause the Company to maintain excess equipment inventory and increase the Company&#8217;s equipment inventory carrying costs. Alternatively, this forecasting difficulty could cause a shortage of equipment for sale or rental that could result in an inability to satisfy demand for the Company&#8217;s products and a loss of market share. 

Variations in the Company&#8217;s revenues and operating results have in the past and could in the future result in a decline in the Company&#8217;s profitability and make it more difficult for the Company to grow our business. 

The Company&#8217;s revenues and operating results vary from quarter to quarter and by season. Periods of decline have in the past and could in the future result in an overall decline in profitability and make it more difficult for the Company to make payments on our indebtedness and grow the Company&#8217;s business. We expect the Company&#8217;s quarterly results to fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors, including: 

&#8226; general economic conditions in the markets where we operate; 

&#8226; the cyclical and seasonal nature of the Company&#8217;s customers&#8217; business and our sales and rental patterns, particularly the Company&#8217;s construction customers; 

&#8226; the weather conditions, specifically in our northern markets; 

&#8226; the timeliness of OEM equipment deliveries; 

&#8226; ad hoc, period-based, competitive pricing programs offered by competitive equipment OEMs and their dealers that put our products at a disadvantage in a given market from a pricing perspective; 

&#8226; changes in the size of the Company&#8217;s rental fleet, the rate at which we rent our fleet, and the price at which we sell equipment from our fleet; 

&#8226; changes in corporate or government spending for commercial and infrastructure projects; 

&#8226; changes in interest rates and related changes in the Company&#8217;s interest expense and debt service obligations; 

&#8226; changes or fluctuations in skilled technician headcount levels; 

&#8226; timing of technician non-billable hours primarily associated with holiday, paid time off and training programs; 

&#8226; the effectiveness of integrating acquired businesses and new start-up locations; and 

&#8226; timing of acquisitions and new location openings and related costs. 

In addition, the Company incurs various costs when integrating newly acquired businesses or opening new start-up locations, and the profitability of a new location is generally expected to be lower in the initial months or years of operation. 

The Company is subject to competition, which may have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business by reducing the Company&#8217;s ability to increase or maintain revenues or profitability. 

The equipment dealership and rental industries are highly competitive and fragmented. Many of the markets in which the Company operates are served by a large number of competitors, ranging from national and multi-regional equipment dealerships and rental companies to small, independent businesses with a limited number of locations. Some of the Company&#8217;s competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing, and other resources than the Company does, and may be able to reduce rental rates or sales prices in the market, which could negatively impact our business. The Company may encounter increased competition from existing competitors or new market entrants in the future which could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The Company is subject to the ability of our OEMs to deliver cost competitive equipment and parts timely. 

To the extent the cost of our OEMs equipment is not competitive versus our competition&#8217;s equipment, the Company could suffer lost sales and market share over time. This loss of market share would ultimately reduce our serviceable field population of equipment which yields revenues in our high-margin product support departments. Additionally, to the extent our OEMs replacement parts are not cost competitive versus the competition this could impact the total cost of ownership of a piece of equipment from a customer perspective and ultimately lead to lost sales for the Company. 

&#160; 

The Company purchases a significant amount of our equipment from a limited number of manufacturers. Termination of one or more of the Company&#8217;s relationships with any of those manufacturers could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business. 

The Company purchases most of our sales and rental equipment, and aftermarket parts from leading, internationally known OEMs. During the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 58% of the Company&#8217;s equipment and aftermarket parts sales were purchased from five major manufacturers (Volvo, Hyster-Yale, Kubota, CNH, and JCB). Although the Company believes we have alternative sources of supply for equipment sales and aftermarket parts we purchase in each of our core product categories, termination of one or more of the Company&#8217;s relationships with any of these major suppliers could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations if we were unable to obtain an adequate replacement supplier. 

The Company is dependent upon the success and continued viability of our OEM suppliers for which we are distributors. 

The success of our business is, to a certain degree, dependent on our OEMs in several key respects. First, we rely on our various OEMs for our new equipment and replacement parts inventory. Our ability to sell new equipment is dependent on an OEM&#8217;s ability to design, manufacture, and allocate to our branch locations an attractive, high-quality, and desirable product mix at the right time and at the right price in order to satisfy customer demand. Second, some of the Company's OEMs support their dealers by providing direct floor plan lending for new, used and rental equipment through related-party OEM captive finance companies. To the extent an OEMs commercial business suffers it could have an adverse effect on its related OEM captive finance company, and vice versa. Third, manufacturers provide product warranties and, in some cases, service contracts to customers. Our technicians perform warranty and service contract work for equipment under manufacturer product warranties and service contracts, and we direct bill the manufacturer as opposed to invoicing the customer. At any particular time, we have significant receivables from manufacturers for warranty and service work performed for customers. In addition, we rely on manufacturers to varying extents for training, product brochures and point of sale materials, and other items for our operation. Our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected as a result of any event that has an adverse effect on our equipment OEMs. 

Some of the Company&#8217;s suppliers of new equipment and aftermarket parts may appoint additional distributors, sell directly, or unilaterally terminate the Company&#8217;s distribution agreements, which could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business due to a reduction of, or inability to increase, the Company&#8217;s revenues. 

The Company is a distributor of new equipment and parts supplied by leading, nationally recognized suppliers. In certain instances, under the Company&#8217;s distribution agreements with these suppliers, manufacturers may generally retain the right to appoint additional dealers and sell directly to national accounts and government agencies. Additionally, most of our distribution agreements grant our suppliers the right to unilaterally terminate distribution agreements with the Company at any time without cause. Any such actions could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The cost of new equipment the Company sells or purchases for use in our rental fleet may increase and the Company may not be able to pass these increases along to customers or otherwise offset these cost increases in our operation. 

The cost of new equipment from manufacturers that the Company sells or purchases for use in our rental fleet may increase as a result of increased raw material costs, including increases in the cost of steel which is a primary material used in most of this equipment, or due to increased regulatory requirements, such as those related to taxes, tariffs or emissions. These increases could materially impact the Company&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations in future periods if the Company is not able to pass such cost increases through to the Company&#8217;s customers. Similarly, any increase in the cost of parts the Company purchases for resale could materially impact the Company&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations in future periods if the Company is not able to pass such cost increases through to the Company&#8217;s customers. 

The Company&#8217;s rental fleet and used equipment is subject to market value risk. 

The market value of any given piece of rental or used equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold. The market value of used equipment depends on several factors including: the market price for new equipment of a like kind; wear and tear on the equipment relative to its age; worldwide and domestic demands for used equipment; the supply of used equipment on the market; and general economic conditions. Additionally, the Company&#8217;s collateral base for borrowings, and thus available liquidity, is linked to the market value, obtained via third-party appraisals, of its rental fleet and used equipment. Any significant decline in the selling prices for used equipment could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, available liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

The Company incurs maintenance and repair costs associated with our rental fleet equipment that could have an adverse effect on our business in the event these costs are greater than anticipated. 

As the Company&#8217;s fleet of rental equipment ages, the cost of maintaining such equipment generally increases, if not replaced within a certain period of time. Determining the optimal age for the Company&#8217;s rental fleet equipment is based on subjective estimates made by the Company&#8217;s management team. The Company&#8217;s future operating results could be adversely affected because the Company&#8217;s maintenance and repair costs on our rental fleet may be higher than anticipated. 

Security breaches and other disruptions in the Company&#8217;s IT systems, including the Company&#8217;s ERP system, could limit the Company&#8217;s capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations, compromise ours or our employees', customers&#8217; and suppliers&#8217; confidential information, or otherwise adversely affect the Company&#8217;s operating results or business reputation. 

The Company&#8217;s IT systems, some of which are managed by third parties, facilitate the Company&#8217;s ability to monitor and control the Company&#8217;s operations and adjust to changing market conditions, including processing, transmitting, storing, managing, and supporting a variety of business processes, activities, and information. Further, as the Company pursues a strategy to grow through acquisitions and pursue new initiatives that require IT solutions, we are expanding our information technologies, resulting in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk, including emerging risks posed by artificial intelligence. 

&#160; 

Any disruption in any of these systems, including the Company&#8217;s customer management system, or the failure of any of these systems to operate as expected could, depending on the magnitude of the problem, adversely affect the Company&#8217;s operating results by limiting the Company&#8217;s capacity to effectively monitor and control the Company&#8217;s operations and adjust to changing market conditions, which in turn could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation. 

The Company collects and stores sensitive data, including proprietary business information and the proprietary business information of the Company&#8217;s customers and suppliers, in data centers and on IT networks, including cloud-based networks. The secure operation of these IT networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to the Company&#8217;s business operations and strategy. Despite security measures and business continuity plans, the Company&#8217;s IT networks and infrastructure are vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to the threat of attacks by cyber criminals, breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, terrorist acts, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The Company faces risks from cybersecurity threats that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and reputation. Although such risks have not materially affected our business, to date, we have experienced various immaterial threats to our data and systems. The growing use and rapid evolution of technology, including mobile devices, has heightened the risk of unintentional data breaches or leaks. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise the Company&#8217;s networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. In addition, the Company may need to invest additional resources to protect the security of the Company&#8217;s systems or to comply with evolving privacy, data security, cybersecurity, and data protection laws applicable to the Company&#8217;s business. 

Any failure to effectively prevent, detect, and/or recover from any breach, disclosure or other loss of information, or to comply with any such current or future law related thereto, could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations, and damage the Company&#8217;s reputation, which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, stock price and reputation. 

We are in the midst of a multiyear process of implementing a new ERP system. Implementing a new ERP system is not only costly but complex and difficult. Implementing a new ERP system can negatively affect not only financial accounting and reporting processes, but also external commercial activities such as order receipt and product delivery. We cannot be assured that we will successfully implement our new ERP system or that we will avoid these and other negative impacts from our implementation efforts. 

Fluctuations in fuel costs or reduced supplies of fuel could harm the Company&#8217;s business. 

The Company could be adversely affected by limitations on fuel supplies or significant increases in fuel prices that result in higher costs related to deploying the Company&#8217;s field service fleet and for transporting equipment from one location to another. A significant or protracted disruption of fuel supplies could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

The Company is dependent on key personnel. A loss of key personnel could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business which could result in a decline in the Company&#8217;s revenues and profitability. 

The Company&#8217;s success is dependent, in part, on the experience and skills of the Company&#8217;s management team. Competition for top management talent within the Company&#8217;s industry is generally significant. If the Company is unable to recruit and keep talent in all of the Company&#8217;s senior management positions, or if the Company loses the services of any key member of the Company&#8217;s senior management team and is unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, the Company may be challenged to effectively manage our business and execute our strategy. 

If the Company fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls, the Company may not be able to accurately report financial results or prevent fraud and losses of investor confidence and an adverse impact on our stock price could result. 

If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, prevent fraud, and to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected. This could subject us to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties, stockholder litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses as well as negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price . 

There can be no assurance the Company will be able to maintain a system of internal controls that fully complies with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or that the Company&#8217;s management and independent registered public accounting firm will conclude the Company&#8217;s internal controls are effective. 

Labor disputes could disrupt the Company&#8217;s ability to serve our customers and/or lead to higher labor costs. 

The Company has approximately 700 employees who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and approximately 2,200 employees who are not represented by unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. Various unions periodically seek to organize certain departments and/or locations of the Company&#8217;s non-union employees. Union organizing efforts or collective bargaining negotiations could potentially lead to work stoppages, strikes and/or slowdowns by certain employees of the Company, which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s ability to serve our customers. Further, the inability to reach a feasible agreement could lead to the exit of a region, business line or segment, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Lastly, settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes or an increase in the number of the Company&#8217;s employees covered by collective bargaining agreements could have adverse effects on the Company&#8217;s labor costs, productivity and business flexibility. 

Increases in healthcare, pension and other costs under the Company&#8217;s benefit plans could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

We provide single employer and multiemployer health, defined benefit pension and defined contribution benefits to many of our employees. The costs of such benefits continue to increase, and the extent of any increase depends on a number of different factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include governmental regulations such as The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which resulted in changes to the U.S. healthcare system and impose mandatory types of coverage, reporting and other requirements on U.S. companies; return on plan assets; changes in actuarial valuations, estimates, or assumptions used to determine our benefit obligations for certain benefit plans, which require the use of significant estimates, including the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, mortality rates and the rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs; for multiemployer plans, the outcome of collective bargaining and actions taken by trustees who manage the plans; and potential changes to applicable legislation or regulation. 

The Company has various health plans that cover eligible employees, including a self-insured group health plan, workers compensation, and auto coverage which contain certain stop-loss provisions. While we endeavor to purchase insurance coverage appropriate to our risk assessment, we are unable to predict with certainty the frequency, nature or magnitude of claims. Our business may be adversely impacted if our insurance proves to be inadequate. In addition, claims associated with risks we have retained through our self-insurance may exceed our recorded liabilities which could negatively impact future earnings. Accrued health insurance for both known claims and an estimated amount of claims incurred but not reported was $5.1 million and $3.1 million, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Also, if there are significant increases in healthcare costs, the premiums paid by the Company could adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations. Health benefit plan expenses, including benefits paid and insurance premiums, totaled approximately $30.9 million, $29.9 million, and $25.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. If we are unable to control these benefits and costs, we may experience increased operating costs, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

Risks Related to the Company&#8217;s Growth, Acquisitions and Integration 

The Company may not be able to identify or complete transactions with attractive acquisition candidates. Future acquisitions may result in significant transaction expenses, and the Company may experience integration and consolidation risks. 

An important element of the Company&#8217;s growth strategy is to selectively pursue, on an opportunistic basis, acquisitions of additional businesses, in particular companies that complement the Company&#8217;s existing business and footprint. The success of this element of the Company&#8217;s growth strategy depends, in part, on selecting strategic acquisition candidates at attractive prices and effectively integrating their businesses into the Company&#8217;s own, including with respect to financial reporting and regulatory matters. The Company cannot assure you we will be able to identify attractive acquisition candidates or complete the acquisition of any identified candidates at favorable prices or upon advantageous terms and conditions. 

The Company may not have sufficient management, financial, and other resources to integrate and consolidate any future acquisitions. Any significant diversion of management&#8217;s attention or any major difficulties encountered in the integration of the businesses the Company acquires could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations, which could decrease the Company&#8217;s profitability and make it more difficult for the Company to grow. Among other things, these integration risks could include: 

&#8226; the loss of key employees; 

&#8226; disruption of operations and business; 

&#8226; retention or transition of existing customers and vendors; 

&#8226; integration of corporate cultures and maintenance of employee morale; 

&#8226; inability to maintain and increase competitive presence; 

&#8226; customers and revenue losses; 

&#8226; the inability to properly implement the Company's standards, control procedures, and policies; 

&#8226; problems with the assimilation of new operations, sites or personnel, which could divert resources from the Company&#8217;s regular operations; 

&#8226; impairment of goodwill or other acquisition-related intangible assets; 

&#8226; integration of financial reporting, treasury, and regulatory reporting functions; and/or 

&#8226; potential unknown liabilities. 

In addition, general economic conditions or unfavorable capital and credit markets could affect the timing and extent to which the Company can successfully acquire or integrate new businesses, which could limit the Company&#8217;s revenues and profitability and make it more difficult for the Company to grow. 

The Company may not be able to facilitate our growth strategy by identifying and opening start-up locations, which could limit the Company&#8217;s revenues and profitability. 

An element of the Company&#8217;s growth strategy is to selectively identify and implement start-up locations in order to add new customers. The success of this element of the Company&#8217;s growth strategy depends, in part, on identifying strategic start-up locations. The Company cannot be sure we will be able to identify attractive start-up locations and opening start-up locations may involve significant costs and limit the Company&#8217;s ability to expand our operations. 

The Company may not have sufficient management, financial, and other resources to successfully operate new locations. Any significant diversion of management&#8217;s attention or any major difficulties encountered in the locations the Company opens in the future could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations, which could decrease the Company&#8217;s profitability and make it more difficult for the Company to grow. 

&#160; 

The Company may not be able to successfully or profitably launch our commercial electric vehicle and hydrogen related businesses. 

With our existing expertise in electro-mobility, we have elected to pursue the strategic opportunity to leverage our knowledge to meet the growing demand for zero-emission commercial vehicles and deliver service to commercial vehicle fleet customers within our existing territories. This strategic opportunity requires us to devote certain resources to it, including the time and attention of management. Failure to execute on this plan or a failure of the Company, or our partners, in its choice of strategy to pursue zero-emission commercial vehicles or to successfully capitalize on its strategy could cause a diversion of management&#8217;s attention and have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations, which could decrease the Company&#8217;s profitability and make it more difficult for the Company to grow. In an effort related to accelerating the adoption of zero-emissions commercial electric vehicles and lift trucks, the Company is also in the process of investing in a hydrogen gas production plant, as compressed hydrogen gas powers hydrogen fuel cells for several of our current lift truck customers. We believe, like several other market participants, that hydrogen gas will also power fuel cell electric vehicles in the future. To the extent we are unable to execute on our plan to produce and sell hydrogen gas to our customers, or the adoption of hydrogen consuming vehicles and lift trucks in the marketplace does not develop, it could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s profitability and make it more difficult for the Company to grow. 

If we determine our goodwill or other intangible assets have become impaired, we may incur impairment charges which would negatively impact our operating results. 

At December 31, 2024, we had $77.5 million of goodwill and $54.7 million of other intangible assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. We assess potential impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets at least annually. Impairment may result from significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets, negative industry or economic trends, and/or significant underperformance relative to historic or projected operating results. For a discussion of our goodwill and long-lived assets impairment testing, see &#8220;Evaluation of Goodwill Impairment&#8221; and ""Evaluation of Long-lived Asset Impairment (excluding goodwill)"" in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 

Financial Risks and Risks Related to our Indebtedness and Liquidity 

The Company&#8217;s substantial indebtedness could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s financial condition. 

The Company has, and will continue to have, a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding. The Company&#8217;s indebtedness may result in important consequences, such as: 

&#8226; increasing the Company&#8217;s vulnerability to general adverse economic, industry, and competitive conditions; 

&#8226; requiring the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate initiatives; 

&#8226; limiting the Company&#8217;s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the Company&#8217;s business and the industry in which we operate; 

&#8226; making it more difficult to refinance or pay our debts as they become due during adverse economic, financial market, or industry conditions; 

&#8226; placing the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; 

&#8226; resulting in a downgrade in our credit rating, which could increase the cost of further borrowings; 

&#8226; requiring our debt to become due and payable upon a change in control; and 

&#8226; limiting the Company&#8217;s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes. 

The Company expects to use cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities to meet our current and future financial obligations, including funding our operations, service debt, and capital expenditures. The Company&#8217;s business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, which could result in the Company being unable to repay indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. 

&#160; 

The Company may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service all of the Company&#8217;s indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful. 

The Company&#8217;s ability to make scheduled debt payments depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond the Company&#8217;s control. The Company cannot make assurances we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay scheduled payments of principal and interest on the Company&#8217;s indebtedness. In the absence of adequate operating performance, the Company could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The Company may not be able to consummate those dispositions, and any proceeds we do receive from a disposition may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. 

If the Company&#8217;s cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, the Company may be forced to reduce or delay business activities and capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness. The Company cannot make any assurances we will be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms or at all, or that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements. In addition, our existing debt agreements, as well as any future debt agreements, contain or may contain restrictive covenants, which may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all our debt. 

The agreements governing credit facilities may restrict the Company&#8217;s business and our ability to engage in certain corporate and financial transactions. 

The agreements governing the credit facilities contain certain covenants that, among other things, may restrict or limit the Company and its subsidiaries&#8217; ability to: 

&#8226; incur more debt; 

&#8226; pay dividends (including dividends on preferred and common stock) and make distributions; 

&#8226; make acquisitions or investments; 

&#8226; repurchase stock; 

&#8226; create liens; 

&#8226; enter into transactions with affiliates; 

&#8226; enter into sale and lease-back transactions; 

&#8226; merge or consolidate; and 

&#8226; transfer and sell assets. 

Events beyond the Company&#8217;s control may also affect our ability to comply with other provisions governing the Company&#8217;s credit facilities. The Company&#8217;s failure to comply with obligations under the agreements may result in an event of default. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of this indebtedness and the Company&#8217;s other indebtedness. The Company may not be able to remedy these defaults. If the Company&#8217;s indebtedness is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness and may not have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to the Company or at all. 

The Company relies on OEM captive finance companies to provide floor plan financing primarily for new equipment. This OEM captive floor plan financing provides for a large portion of the Company&#8217;s ongoing working capital requirements. The Company&#8217;s liquidity position, financial condition, cash flows and results from operations could be adversely affected in the event any of our OEM captive finance company agreements were terminated and/or amended to the detriment of the Company. 

As our OEM captive floor plan finance agreements are annually renewing and subject to ongoing credit review, which can be judgment-based and over which the Company has no control, the Company cannot make any assurances that our OEM captive finance agreements will be renewed in the future or renewed with terms that are favorable to the Company. To the extent we are unable to renew, or renew on favorable terms, any of our OEM captive floor plan finance agreements our liquidity position, financial condition, cash flows and results from operations could be adversely impacted. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s business could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain additional capital as required and could result in a decrease in the Company&#8217;s revenues and profitability. In addition, the Company&#8217;s inability to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all, could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s liquidity and our ongoing results of operations. 

The cash the Company generates from our business, together with cash we may borrow, if credit is available, may not be sufficient to fund the Company&#8217;s operations or capital requirements. The Company may require additional financing to obtain capital for, among other purposes, purchasing equipment, completing acquisitions, establishing new locations and to repay or refinance existing indebtedness. Any additional indebtedness the Company incurs will make us more vulnerable to business downturns and limit the Company&#8217;s ability to withstand competitive pressures. Moreover, the Company may not be able to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain sufficient additional financing in the future, the Company&#8217;s business could be adversely affected. 

In addition, prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing could increase the Company&#8217;s interest expense. A refinancing of the Company&#8217;s indebtedness could also require us to comply with more onerous covenants and further restrict the Company&#8217;s business operations. The Company&#8217;s inability to refinance its indebtedness or to do so upon attractive terms could materially and adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business prospects, results of operations and cash flows, financial condition, and make us vulnerable to adverse industry and general economic conditions. 

Unfavorable conditions or disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely impact business conditions and the availability of credit. 

Disruptions in the global capital and credit markets as a result of an economic downturn, economic uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s customers&#8217; ability to access capital and could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s access to liquidity needed to fund business operations in the future. Additionally, unfavorable financial market conditions may depress demand for the Company&#8217;s products and services and/or make it difficult for the Company&#8217;s customers to obtain financing and credit on reasonable terms. Unfavorable financial market conditions also may cause more of the Company&#8217;s customers to be unable to meet their payment obligations to the Company, increasing delinquencies and credit losses. If the Company is unable to manage credit risk or customer risk adequately, the Company&#8217;s credit losses could increase above historical levels and the Company&#8217;s operating results would be adversely affected. The Company&#8217;s suppliers may also be adversely impacted by unfavorable capital and credit markets, causing disruption or delay of product availability or their competitiveness in the market overall. Additionally, many of our key OEM suppliers provide floor plan financing to the Company through related party captive finance companies (e.g. Volvo Financial Services). To the extent our OEM captive finance partners are impacted by unfavorable capital and/or credit market conditions, the Company&#8217;s liquidity position, ability to borrow, or ability to borrow at favorable rates could be adversely impacted. These events could negatively impact the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

Risk Related to Our Series A Preferred Stock and Depositary Shares 

The Series A Preferred Stock and the depositary shares rank junior to all our indebtedness and other liabilities and are effectively junior to all indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. 

In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs, our assets will be available to pay obligations on the Series A Preferred Stock only after all our indebtedness and other liabilities have been paid. The rights of holders of the Series A Preferred Stock to participate in the distribution of our assets will rank junior to the priority claims of our current and future creditors and any future series or class of preferred stock we may issue that ranks senior to the Series A Preferred Stock. In addition, the Series A Preferred Stock effectively ranks junior to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our existing subsidiaries and any future subsidiaries. Our existing subsidiaries are, and any future subsidiaries would be, separate legal entities and have no legal obligation to pay any amounts with respect to dividends due on the Series A Preferred Stock. If we are forced to liquidate our assets to pay our creditors, we may not have sufficient assets to pay amounts due on any or all of the Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding. We and our subsidiaries have incurred and may in the future incur substantial amounts of debt and other obligations that will rank senior to the Series A Preferred Stock. We may incur additional indebtedness and become more highly leveraged in the future, which could harm our financial position and potentially limit our cash available to pay dividends. As a result, we may not have sufficient funds remaining to satisfy our dividend obligations relating to our Series A Preferred Stock if we incur additional indebtedness. In addition, our existing credit arrangements include events of default which could result in acceleration of such indebtedness upon the occurrence of certain events, including failure to meet certain financial covenants. 

&#160; 

We may not be able to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock if we have insufficient cash or available &#8216;surplus&#8217; as defined under Delaware law to make such dividend payments. 

Our ability to pay cash dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock is restricted by Delaware law and generally requires us to have either net profits or positive net assets (total assets less total liabilities) as calculated in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law, and that we have sufficient working capital in order to be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business. Our ability to pay dividends may be impaired by a number of factors, including the other risks identified herein. Also, our payment of dividends depends upon our financial condition and other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time. Our businesses may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs and pay dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock. 

Our depositary shares representing interests in the Series A Preferred Stock have extremely limited voting rights. 

The voting rights of holders of our depositary shares are limited. Our common stock is the only class of our securities that carries full voting rights. Voting rights for holders of depositary shares exist primarily with respect to the ability to elect (together with the holders of other outstanding series of our preferred stock, or depositary shares representing interests in our preferred stock, or additional series of preferred stock we may issue in the future and upon which similar voting rights have been or are in the future conferred and are exercisable) two additional directors to our Board of Directors in the event six quarterly dividends (whether or not declared or consecutive) payable on the Series A Preferred Stock are in arrears, and with respect to voting on amendments to our articles of incorporation or certificate of designation (in some cases voting together with the holders of other outstanding series of our preferred stock as a single class) that adversely affect the rights of the holders of depositary shares representing interests in the Series A Preferred Stock (and other series of preferred stock, as applicable) or create additional classes or series of our stock that are senior to the Series A Preferred Stock, provided that in any event adequate provision for redemption has not been made. Other than the limited circumstances included in the certificate of designations for the Series A Preferred Stock and the agreement creating the depositary shares, holders of depositary shares will not have any voting rights. 

Legal and Regulatory Risks Related to the Company&#8217;s Operations 

The Company is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims that could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s operating results. The nature of the Company&#8217;s business exposes us to various liability claims, which may exceed the level of the Company&#8217;s insurance coverage resulting in the Company not being fully protected. 

The Company is a party to lawsuits in the normal course of business. Litigation in general can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. Responding to lawsuits brought against the Company, or legal actions that the Company may initiate, can often be expensive and time-consuming. Unfavorable outcomes from these claims and/or lawsuits could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition, and the Company could incur substantial monetary liability and/or be required to change our business practices. 

The Company&#8217;s business exposes us to claims for personal injury, death or property damage resulting from the use of the equipment we rent or sell and from injuries caused in motor vehicle accidents in which the Company&#8217;s delivery and service personnel are involved and claims related to other employee related matters. Additionally, the Company could be subject to potential litigation associated with compliance with various laws and governmental regulations at the federal, state or local levels, such as those relating to the protection of persons with disabilities, employment, health, safety, security and other regulations under which the Company operates. 

The Company carries comprehensive insurance, subject to deductibles, at levels we believe are sufficient to cover existing and future claims made during the respective policy periods. However, the Company may be exposed to multiple claims, and, as a result, could incur significant out-of-pocket costs before reaching the deductible amount which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the cost of such insurance policies may increase significantly upon renewal of those policies as a result of general rate increases for the type of insurance the Company carries as well as the Company&#8217;s historical experience and experience in the Company&#8217;s industry. Although the Company has not experienced any material losses that were not covered by insurance, the Company&#8217;s existing or future claims may exceed the coverage level of the Company&#8217;s insurance, and such insurance may not continue to be available on economically reasonable terms, or at all. If the Company is required to pay significantly higher premiums for insurance, is not able to maintain insurance coverage at affordable rates or if we must pay amounts in excess of claims covered by the Company&#8217;s insurance, the Company could experience higher costs that could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

The Company has operations throughout the U.S. and Canada and purchases capital goods from Europe which exposes us to multiple international, federal, state and local regulations. Changes in applicable law, regulations or requirements, or the Company&#8217;s material failure to comply with any of them, can increase the Company&#8217;s costs and have other negative impacts on the Company&#8217;s business. 

The Company&#8217;s 80 branch locations in the U.S. are located in 15 different states, which exposes us to different federal, state, and local regulations and taxation. The Company also has seven locations throughout Canada and acquires inventory from Europe which exposes us to foreign regulations and taxation as well. These laws and requirements address multiple aspects of the Company&#8217;s operations, such as worker safety, consumer rights, privacy, employee benefits, taxation, securities law compliance and more, and can often have different requirements in different jurisdictions. Changes in these requirements, or any material failure by the Company to comply with them, could increase the Company&#8217;s costs, affect our reputation, limit our business, consume management&#8217;s time and attention or otherwise generally impact our operations and financial results in adverse ways. 

The Company could be adversely affected by environmental and safety requirements which could force us to use significant capital resources, increase operational costs and/or may subject us to unanticipated liabilities. 

The Company&#8217;s operations, like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses, require the handling, use, storage, and disposal of certain regulated materials. As a result, the Company is subject to the requirements of federal, state, and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. The Company is subject to potentially significant civil or criminal fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements. The Company has made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures in order to comply with these laws and regulations, but the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, and could become more stringent in the future. It is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have an adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Environmental laws also impose obligations and liability for the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substance spills or releases. These liabilities can be imposed on the parties generating or disposing of such substances or the operator of the affected property, often without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous substances. Accordingly, the Company may become liable, either contractually or by operation of law, for remediation costs even if a contaminated property is not currently owned or operated by the Company, or if the contamination was caused by third parties during or prior to the Company&#8217;s ownership or operation of the property. Given the nature of the Company&#8217;s operations (which involve the use of batteries, petroleum products, solvents and other hazardous substances for fueling and maintaining the Company&#8217;s equipment and vehicles), there can be no assurance that prior site assessments or investigations have identified all potential instances of soil or groundwater contamination. 

In the future, international, federal, state, or local governments could enact new or more stringent laws or issue new or more stringent regulations concerning environmental and worker health and safety matters or effect a change in their enforcement of existing laws or regulations, that could affect our operations. There can be no assurance that we, or various environmental regulatory agencies, will not discover previously unknown environmental non-compliance or contamination, for which we could be held liable. It is possible that changes in environmental and worker health and safety laws or liabilities from newly discovered non-compliance or contamination could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Investing in our common stock involves significant risk and investors should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all other information included or referenced in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There are numerous and varied risks, known and unknown, that may prevent us from achieving our goals. The risks described below are not the only ones we will face. In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, any of the factors set forth below could significantly and negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects and the trading price of our stock. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Summary of Risk Factors 

Material risks that may affect our business, operating results and financial condition include, but are not necessarily limited to, those relating to: 

&#8226; we may need to raise substantial funds in the future to fund our operations. These funds may not be available on acceptable terms or at all and our ability to fund the execution of our business objectives cannot be assured. A failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed could force us to delay, limit, scale back or cease some or all operations. 

&#8226; we have incurred significant operating losses since inception and cannot assure you that we will ever achieve or sustain profitability; 

&#8226; we may fail to obtain regulatory approvals to market our products in the United States or in other countries; 

&#8226; Libervant for ARS patients aged between two and five years being blocked from remaining in the U.S. market due to a competitor&#8217;s orphan drug market exclusivity status; 

&#8226; the development of pharmaceutical products involves a lengthy and expensive process, with an uncertain outcome. We may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of any product; 

&#8226; if our competitors are better able to develop products for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the central nervous system and the treatment for anaphylaxis that are safer, more effective, less costly, easier to use or otherwise more attractive than our PharmFilm technology, our business will be adversely impacted; 

&#8226; even if our product candidates are approved for commercial sale, if we are unable to develop a sales and marketing infrastructure, we may not be successful in commercializing our products in the United States; 

&#8226; our ability to commercialize our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement will be available from government and health administration authorities, private health maintenance organizations and health insurers, and other healthcare payors; 

&#8226; any delays or changes to the timing, cost and success of clinical trials for Anaphylm and our other product candidates; 

&#8226; failure to generate sufficient data in our PK and PD comparability submission for FDA approval of Anaphylm; 

&#8226; we have entered into, and may enter into collaborations, licensing arrangements, joint ventures, strategic alliances or partnerships with third-parties that may not result in the development of commercially viable products or the generation of significant future revenues; 

&#8226; we are and will be dependent on third-party CROs to conduct all of our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if the third parties need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our preclinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates; 

&#8226; our future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel; 

&#8226; our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology is uncertain; 

&#8226; we may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we, or our colleagues, have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our competitors or are in breach of non-competition or non-solicitation agreements with our competitors; 

&#8226; our products and operations are subject to extensive governmental regulation, and failure to comply with applicable requirements could cause our business to suffer; 

&#8226; if we issue more shares of our Common Stock to raise capital, our current stockholders will incur substantial dilution; 

&#8226; we may be subject to damages resulting from litigation matters currently pending against Aquestive; 

&#8226; cybersecurity continues to affect businesses and could cause business interruption; and 

&#8226; adverse developments affecting the financial services industry which could adversely affect our current and projected business operations and our financial condition and results of operations. 

Risks Related to Our Financial Condition and Need for Additional Capital 

We have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability. 

Some of our product candidates will require substantial additional development time and resources before we are able to receive regulatory approvals, implement commercialization infrastructure and strategies, or license product out to begin generating revenue from product sales or royalty streams. Our current product candidates are still in their early stages, and we may not generate substantial revenue from sales or royalties of our product candidates in the near term, if ever. 

We have devoted most of our financial resources to product development. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity and debt securities, proceeds from our debt facilities, and from revenues from certain product licenses and collaborations. The extent of future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future expenditures and our ability to generate revenue. 

The development, regulatory approval process, and commercialization of drug candidates involve significant risk and significant uncertainty, including matters over which we have no control. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to fully predict the timing or amount of our expenses. We expect to incur substantial expenses going forward, which we expect will increase as we expand our development activities and product portfolio. Some of the expenses we expect to incur going forward include: 

&#8226; conducting clinical trials of our product candidates; 

&#8226; seeking regulatory approval for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical development; 

&#8226; maintaining, expanding and protecting our intellectual property portfolio; 

&#8226; acquiring or in-licensing new technologies or development-stage or approved products; 

&#8226; activities related to pre-commercialization and commercialization of products; 

&#8226; adding clinical, scientific, operational, financial, and management information systems personnel, including personnel to support our product development and to support our operations as a public company; and 

&#8226; experiencing incremental costs due to delays or encountering any issues with any of the above, including, but not limited to, failed or not fully successful trials, complex results, safety issues or other regulatory challenges. 

We expect to continue to incur net losses for at least the next few years as we pursue the development efforts and commercialization of our product candidates. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from period to period, depending on regulatory approval developments concerning our product candidates, the timing of our planned clinical trials and expenditures on our other research and development. We expect our expenses will continue to be substantial in 2025 and future periods as we continue to: 

&#8226; clinically develop Anaphylm and provide supporting data needed for market approval from the FDA, anticipated NDA submission, pre-commercialization preparations including manufacturing and regulatory inspections and commercialization activities; 

&#8226; seek licensing and other transactions of our product candidates; 

&#8226; engage with the FDA to overcome the present stay on Libervant entering the U.S. market due to a competitor&#8217;s orphan drug market exclusivity status: 

&#8226; commercialize Libervant for ARS patients between two and five years of age; and 

&#8226; clinical development of our product candidate AQST-108. 

We expect to continue to manage the timing and level of expenses in light of the declining Suboxone revenues, while focusing on the development and commercialization of Anaphylm. 

We will need substantial additional capital to fund our operations, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. 

Our cash requirements for 2025 and beyond include expenses related to continuing development and clinical evaluation of our products, manufacture and supply costs, costs of regulatory filings, patent prosecution expenses and litigation expenses, expenses related to commercialization of our products, as well as costs to comply with the requirements of being a public company operating in a highly regulated industry. As of December 31, 2024, we had $71.5 million of cash and cash equivalents. 

Capital may be available under our ATM facility, which we initially established in 2019, and under which, from time to time, we may offer and sell shares of our Common Stock pursuant to the Amended Equity Distribution Agreement with Piper Sandler &#38; Co.. On April 3, 2024, we filed a new shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (the ""2024 Registration Statement""), which was declared effective by the SEC on April 23, 2024. Included in the 2024 Registration Statement are: (i) a base prospectus registering the offer, issuance and sale of up to $250,000 worth of Common Stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, rights and units and (ii) the $100,000 ATM facility prospectus. The remaining authorized balance of the ATM facility was $100,000 as of December 31, 2024. For additional information regarding shares sold under the ATM facility subsequent to December 31, 2024, see Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Liquidity and Capital Resources and Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 24, Subsequent Events. 

In April 2022, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park, under which, from time to time, we may cause Lincoln Park to purchase shares of our Common Stock. The Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park has approximately an equivalent to 6,486,623 shares available for purchase at December 31, 2024. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we did not sell shares in connection with the Lincoln Park Purchase Agreement. We have no current intent to use the Lincoln Park facility and the Lincoln Park Purchase agreement will expire on April 12, 2025. 

On November 1, 2023, we reduced our debt payment obligations when we issued (the &#8220;Offering&#8221;) $45,000 aggregate principal amount of our 13.5% Notes. A portion of the net proceeds from the Offering was used to redeem all of the outstanding 12.5% Notes and to pay expenses relating to the Offering, with the balance of the proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes. Interest on the 13.5% Notes accrues at a rate of 13.5% per annum and is payable quarterly in arrears on March 30, June 30, September 30 and December 30 of each year (each, a &#8220;Payment Date&#8221;). The 13.5% Notes are interest only until June 30, 2026, whereupon on such date and each Payment Date thereafter, we will also pay an installment of principal of the 13.5% Notes pursuant to a fixed amortization schedule, along with a portion of an Exit Fee determined as of the applicable date of prepayment, payment, acceleration, repurchase or redemption, as the case may be. 

Until we become profitable, if ever, we expect to need to raise significant additional capital in the future through equity or debt issuances, or both, to continue to manage our expenses to extend our capital runway, in order to further the development, and regulatory approval of our products and product candidates, and to conduct our business. We have no committed sources of additional capital, and there can be no assurance that such needed capital or debt financing will be available or available on favorable terms, or at all. We may seek to obtain additional capital in the future through the issuance of our Common Stock, through other public or private equity or debt financings, through potential non-dilutive capital raising events that may result from royalty streams that may be realizable from our licensed products or licensed intellectual property, through collaborations or licensing arrangements with other companies, and through the sale of assets, including product, product candidates, plants or other tangible assets, or by other means, if available. We may not be able to raise additional capital or other funding on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and any failure to raise capital as and when needed could compromise our ability to execute on our business plan and cause us to delay or curtail our operations until such funding is received. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuance of equity securities, our stockholders would experience dilution, and debt financings, if available (and subject to all of the existing restrictions and conditions under our debt instruments) may involve increased restrictive covenants and increased fixed payments or may otherwise further constrain our financial flexibility. We also may seek outlicensing opportunities for our proprietary products and product candidate programs that we currently plan to self-commercialize, including for Libervant and Anaphylm, or explore other potential liquidity options or strategic opportunities. Such strategic opportunities could include asset sales, outlicensing or other monetization opportunities of our proprietary products and product candidates, including Libervant and Anaphylm, although we cannot assure that any of these actions or opportunities would be available or available on available on terms acceptable to us. While an outlicensing of our proprietary products and product candidates, if approved by the FDA, could limit our exposure to the costs of commercialization of the product and provide a potential source of royalty and milestone revenues, the benefit from the potential of additional future value that could result from our independent commercialization of these products and product candidates, assuming a successful launch of our proprietary products and product candidates, if approved by the FDA, would likely be limited. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our intellectual property or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. In addition, payments made by potential collaborators or licensees generally will depend upon our achievement of negotiated 

development, regulatory and sales milestones. Failure to achieve these milestones may harm our future capital position. In addition, in the event of any such asset sales or outlicensing transactions, the future growth of the Company would be dependent on continued successful development of our early stage product candidates and/or asset acquisitions or other strategic transactions for the Company. 

If adequate funds are not available for our liquidity needs and cash requirements, as and when needed, from the sources referred to above or otherwise, or at all, we would be required to engage in expense management activities such as reducing staff, delaying, significantly scaling back, or even discontinuing some or all of our current or planned research and development programs and clinical and other product development activities, or reducing our future commercialization efforts and otherwise significantly reducing our other spending and adjusting our operating plan, and we would need to seek to take other steps intended to improve our liquidity. We also may be required to evaluate additional licensing opportunities, if any become available, of our proprietary product candidate programs that we currently plan to self-commercialize or explore other potential liquidity opportunities or other alternatives or options or strategic alternatives, including asset sales, although we cannot assure that any of these actions would be available or available on reasonable terms. If we do not have sufficient funds to continue operations, we could be required to seek bankruptcy protection or other alternatives that would likely result in our stockholders losing most, if not all, of their investment in Aquestive. 

We may sell additional equity, incur debt or raise funds through licensing arrangements to fund our operations, which may result in dilution to our stockholders, impose restrictions on our business or require us to relinquish proprietary rights. 

Aquestive has experienced a history of net losses and our accumulated deficits totaled $363.2 million as of December 31, 2024. The net losses and accumulated deficits were partially offset by gross margins from sales of commercialized licensed and proprietary products, license fees, milestone and royalty payments from commercial licensees and co-development parties. 

In November 2020, we began utilizing the ATM facility. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we sold 4,557,220 shares which provided net proceeds of approximately $11.8 million, after deducting commissions and other transaction costs of $0.6 million. 

On April 3, 2024, we filed the ""2024 Registration Statement"", which was declared effective by the SEC on April 23, 2024. Included as part of the 2024 Registration Statement are: (i) a base prospectus registering the offer, issuance and sale of up to $250,000 worth of Common Stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, rights and units and (ii) the $100,000 ATM facility prospectus. The remaining authorized balance of the ATM facility was $100,000 as of December 31, 2024. For additional information regarding shares sold under the ATM facility subsequent to December 31, 2024, see Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Liquidity and Capital Resources and Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 24, Subsequent Events . 

Until such time, if ever, that we can generate sufficient revenue to fully fund our operations, we would need to seek additional capital and cash resources through public or private equity or debt financings, third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements, as well as other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, or any combination of these approaches. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the stockholders' existing ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of existing stockholders. Debt financings may be coupled with an equity component, such as warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, which could also result in dilution of existing stockholders&#8217; ownership. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in certain increased restrictive covenants (most, if not all, of which currently exist under our existing debt facilities), such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights or sell assets, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business and continue to result in liens being placed on all of our assets and intellectual property. If we were to default on such indebtedness, we could lose all such assets and intellectual property and our ability to operate our business. 

If we raise additional funds through collaborations, or strategic alliance, marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may need to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, product candidates or future revenue streams or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. 

Even if we can generate revenues from our operations in the future, our revenues and operating income are likely to fluctuate significantly from year-to-year or quarter-to-quarter and create volatility in our stock price. 

Even if we are able to generate future revenues, our results of operations would likely continue to vary significantly from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter. Variations may result from, among other factors: 

&#8226; the timing of FDA or any other regulatory approval, delay in any FDA or other regulatory approvals, or failure to obtain any such FDA or other regulatory approvals; 

&#8226; competitor&#8217;s product candidates obtaining FDA or other regulatory approval, which may include orphan drug market exclusivity for seven years in the U.S., before our product has received any such regulatory approval and/ 

or orphan drug exclusivity, or obtaining other FDA marketing exclusivity that blocks U.S. market access for our product candidates; 

&#8226; the timing of process validation for particular product candidates; 

&#8226; the timing of addressing any additional data required to obtain FDA approval of Anaphylm and delays as a result thereof; 

&#8226; changes in the timing of and the amount we spend to research, develop, acquire, license or promote new product candidates; 

&#8226; the timing, amount we spend on, and outcome of our research, development, preclinical studies and clinical trial programs; 

&#8226; serious or unexpected health or safety concerns related to our products or product candidates; 

&#8226; the introduction of new branded and generic products by others that render our product candidates obsolete, subject to greater competition or noncompetitive; 

&#8226; our ability to maintain selling prices and gross margins on our products; 

&#8226; changes in coverage and reimbursement policies of health plans and other health insurers, including changes to Medicare, Medicaid and similar government healthcare programs; 

&#8226; our ability to comply with complex governmental regulations applicable to many aspects of our business; 

&#8226; increases in the cost of raw materials used to manufacture our products and product candidates; 

&#8226; manufacturing and supply interruptions, including product rejections or recalls due to failure to comply with manufacturing specifications or current Good Manufacturing Practices; 

&#8226; timing of revenue recognition related to our collaboration agreements; 

&#8226; our ability to fund the commercialization of, commence a commercial operation, and actually commercialize our proprietary products and product candidates, if approved by the FDA; 

&#8226; our ability and the significant cost to protect our intellectual property and avoid infringing the intellectual property of others and any adverse developments in any related legal proceeding or in other legal proceedings of any nature; and 

&#8226; the outcome and cost of existing or possible future litigation with third parties. 

Our level of indebtedness and significant debt service obligations could constrain our ability to invest in our business and make it more difficult for us to fund our operations. 

We have substantial debt and substantial debt service obligations. At December 31, 2024, we had an aggregate principal amount of $45.0 million of outstanding indebtedness, represented by the 13.5% Notes. In the future, we will need to raise additional funds. 

Because of our indebtedness: 

&#8226; we may have difficulty satisfying our obligations with respect to our existing indebtedness including the repayment of such indebtedness; 

&#8226; we may have difficulty obtaining financing in the future (and we have substantial restrictions on incurring any additional indebtedness under our current debt instruments) for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes; 

&#8226; we will need to use a substantial portion of our available cash flow to pay interest and principal on our debt, which will reduce the amount of money available to finance our operations and other business activities; 

&#8226; we may be more vulnerable to general economic downturns and adverse industry conditions; 

&#8226; if cash flow from revenues from licensed product or collaborative arrangements are insufficient to satisfy our obligations with respect to our existing indebtedness, we may be forced to seek to sell assets (subject to obtaining consent under the Indenture) or seek additional capital, which we may not be able to accomplish on favorable terms, if at all; 

&#8226; we could be limited in our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in our industry in general; 

&#8226; we could be placed at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt, less debt restriction or less restrictive debt covenants; 

&#8226; our failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt instruments which, among other things, limits our ability to incur additional debt and sell or dispose of assets, could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, would have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects; and 

&#8226; our tangible and intangible assets, including our intellectual property, are subject to first priority liens and may be used to satisfy our outstanding debt. 

We intend to satisfy our current and future debt service obligations with our existing cash and cash equivalents and potential access to other funding. However, we may not have sufficient funds, and may be unable to arrange for additional financing, to pay the amounts due under the Indenture and 13.5% Notes or any other debt instruments we may enter into. Failure to make required debt service payments or comply with other covenants under our existing debt facilities or such other debt instruments would result in an event of default and acceleration of amounts due, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We are dependent upon the commercial success of our licensed and proprietary products and other licensing activities to generate revenue for the near future. 

Although we are in the process of testing and developing proprietary product candidates and may seek to acquire rights in other approved drugs, we anticipate that our ability to generate revenue and to become profitable in the near future will depend upon the continued commercial success of Sympazan, Suboxone and Azstarys in the U.S., the continued commercial success of Ondif in Brazil and Emylif in the EU, and our ability to commercialize our product Libervant for pediatric patients between two and five years of age. Further, there is no assurance that we will become commercially successful to the extent necessary to become profitable. If our current products are not commercially successful, our ability to generate manufacturing and sale margins and licensing or royalty revenues will be impaired. Without those revenues, our ability to continue planned development initiatives and commercialization efforts would be limited. Due to our dependence on the commercial success of our products, delays or setbacks in the commercial success of any of these products would likely materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results and operations and financial consideration. 

A substantial portion of our revenues is derived from a single customer and license and any loss or material reduction in revenues from such significant customer would adversely affect our business. 

Historically, a substantial portion of our revenues in each quarter and year has been derived from a single customer and this trend is expected to continue while we continue to develop, seek regulatory approval of and seek to commercialize our proprietary products and product candidates. If revenues from such key customer were to decline significantly, it would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Indivior accounted for approximately 62% and 80% of our revenues for 2024 and 2023, respectively, and we believe in the future will continue to account for a substantial part of our revenues. 

Further, the Indivior License Agreement under which we manufacture and supply Suboxone to Indivior on an exclusive basis, may be terminated should certain causes or events occur. For example, either party to the Indivior License Agreement may terminate the relationship in connection with a material breach by the other party of its contractual obligations. Indivior may also terminate the Indivior License Agreement if the FDA or other applicable regulatory authority declares our manufacturing site to no longer be suitable for the manufacture of Suboxone or Suboxone is no longer suitable to be manufactured due to health or safety reasons. In addition, the Indivior Licensing Agreement currently has a one-year term, subject to automatic one-year renewals unless either party provides the other party with twelve months&#8217; prior notice of non-renewal. As a result, there can be no assurance that either party will not terminate the Indivior License Agreement either due to any future breach of obligation, other termination cause or event, or notice of non-renewal. Any such termination would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, capital position and prospects. 

Although Suboxone has continued to retain meaningful market share, we expect erosion of this sunsetting branded product over time, which will further affect our total revenues and our results from operations. 

Indivior is a party to a number of lawsuits alleging Indivior engaged in deceptive and misleading marketing and distribution practices in its distribution and sale of Suboxone and seeking a monetary relief. We cannot assess whether this settlement and disposition will have a material adverse financial impact on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and operating results. 

Risks Related to Development and Commercialization of Our Products and Product Candidates 

Our business could be adversely affected if Libervant market access for ARS patients between two and five years of age is blocked. 

On August 30, 2022, the FDA provided an approvable letter for Libervant that stated that Libervant was not cleared for U.S. market access until the orphan drug market exclusivity for Valtoco, a competing nasal spray product, ends in January 2027. On April 29, 2024, we announced that the FDA approved U.S. market access for Libervant in ARS patients between two to five years of age. 

In May 2024, Neurelis, Inc., the maker of Valtoco, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the FDA, HHS, and certain government officials. The complaint in this matter alleges that the defendants violated the Administrative Procedure Act by approving Aquestive&#8217;s NDA for Libervant&#174; for ARS patients aged between two and five years, and asked the court to vacate that approval and enjoin the defendants from approving Libervant for this pediatric patient population until January 10, 2027, the scheduled date for the expiration of the ODE granted for Valtoco by the FDA. 

Aquestive intervened in the litigation to defend the approval of Libervant for this pediatric patient population. The Company's motion for a stay of the District Court's order granting Neurelis' motion for summary Judgment is pending. The Company also filed an appeal of the District Court's order with the U.S. District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The Company has also submitted a request to the FDA that the FDA determines that Libervant for ARS patients between the ages of two and five years is clinically superior to the existing FDA approved products. For greater detail, s ee Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 23, Contingencies to our financial statement s and in Part I Item 1. Business, 

If Neurelis prevails on the appeal or the FDA does not make a determination of clinical superiority in favor of Libervant, we may be required to withdraw Libervant from the U.S. market until such time as the ODE expires for Valtoco in January 2027. This would result in significant changes to our business and delay in future revenues to the Company from Libervant. 

We cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully develop our product candidates or obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. 

Prior to receiving approval to commercialize any of our drug products, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA and/or other regulatory authorities in the U.S. and other countries, that our particular product candidates are both safe and effective. For each drug product, we must demonstrate its efficacy and monitor its safety throughout the process. If development within these parameters is unsuccessful, our business could be harmed, and our stock price could be adversely affected. 

We currently have product candidates in preclinical and clinical development. Our business depends primarily on the successful clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates. Before our product candidates can be marketed, the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory agencies must approve our applicable NDA or comparable regulatory submissions. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is very uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. Further, positive results from earlier stage clinical trials may not be predictive of later clinical trials or other regulatory developments. In addition, many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in later stage clinical trials after achieving positive results in early stage development, and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. Also, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials nonetheless failed to obtain FDA approval. Even after successful completion of clinical testing, there is a risk that the FDA may request further information from us, disagree with our findings or otherwise undertake a lengthy review of our submission. We may be asked to provide further justification and evidence to support the application for approval at an FDA Advisory Committee meeting, which requires significant time and resources to prepare. FDA staff, and the public, may also present their own analyses of the clinical trial data, and discuss other issues at an Advisory Committee meeting. FDA Advisory Committees are typically asked to comment on whether they believe there is adequate safety and effectiveness data to support approval. Advisory Committees may also recommend that FDA request additional studies before approval or suggest changes to a product&#8217;s proposed labeling. Advisory Committees make nonbinding recommendations to FDA. FDA generally follows the recommendations, but is not legally bound to do so. We also face hurdles and setbacks by reason of competitors&#8217; drug candidates obtaining FDA or other regulatory approvals, including orphan drug market exclusivity, prior to our obtaining FDA or other regulatory approval of our similar drug candidate. Even if the FDA approves our NDA, we may be unable to successfully commercialize our products and product candidates. 

In some instances, there can be significant variability in safety or efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to the numerous factors, including changes in clinical trial procedures set forth in protocols, differences in the size and type of the patient populations, adherence to the dosing regimen, and other clinical trial protocols, and the rate of dropout among clinical participants. If we fail to produce positive results in our planned preclinical studies or clinical trials of any of our product candidates, the development timeline and regulatory approval and commercialization prospects for our product candidates and, correspondingly, our business and financial prospects, would be materially adversely affected. 

It is also possible that the FDA will not approve an application that we may submit, or our product candidates may not obtain appropriate regulatory approvals necessary for us to commence clinical trials for our product candidates. Any delay or failure in obtaining required approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business. This process from development to commercialization can take many years and will likely require the expenditure of substantial resources beyond the proceeds we currently have on hand, without any guarantee or assurance that we will be successful with regulatory approval, or commercial success, of such product candidate. 

Even if we obtain approval from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for our current and future product candidates, any approval might contain significant limitations related to use restrictions for specified age groups, warnings, precautions or contraindications, or may be subject to burdensome post-approval study or risk management requirements. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval, or any approval contains significant limitations, we may not be 

able to obtain sufficient funding or generate sufficient revenue to continue the development of that product candidate or any other product candidate that we may in-license, develop or acquire in the future. 

If we do not obtain market exclusivity for certain of our products, including orphan drug exclusivity, our business may be harmed . 

We have received orphan drug market exclusivity for our drug candidate Libervant for ARS patients aged between two and five years, and may in the future seek market exclusivity for other product candidates, including orphan drug market exclusivity. Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. 

Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of market exclusivity, which precludes the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same disease for seven years. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. 

A company that first obtains FDA approval for a designated orphan drug for the designated rare disease or condition receives orphan drug market exclusivity for that drug for the designated disease for a period of seven years in the United States. This orphan drug exclusivity prevents the FDA from approving another application to market a drug containing the same active moiety for the same orphan indication, except in very limited circumstances, including when the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care within the meaning of FDA regulations and guidance. In addition, a designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug market exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. 

Even if we receive orphan drug designation for one or more of our drug candidates, we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval for the orphan-designated indication due to the uncertainties associated with developing product candidates. If any of these other pharmaceutical companies obtains approval of an NDA before we are able to receive approval for one or more of our drug candidates with the same active moiety for the same indication, we would be barred from marketing that product in the United States during the seven-year orphan drug exclusivity period, unless we could demonstrate that such drug candidate is clinically superior to the approved products or satisfies one of the other limited exceptions to such orphan drug exclusivity. 

Further, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs with different active moieties can be approved for the same condition or a drug with the same active moiety can be approved for a different indication as currently permitted pursuant to FDA regulations in the United States. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process. In addition, even if we intend to seek orphan drug designation for any of our product candidates or indications, we may never receive such designations or obtain orphan drug exclusivity. See Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 23, Contingencies. 

Also, overcoming a grant of orphan drug market exclusivity is difficult to establish, with limited precedent. In April 2024 the FDA approved Libervant&#174; (diazepam) Buccal Film, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 12.5 mg, and 15 mg, for ARS patients between the ages of two and five years. This FDA approval was recently determined to be granted in error by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in a lawsuit brought by Neurelis, Inc., and there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its appeal of this court ruling or that the FDA will grant our current request seeking an FDA determination that Libervant for this young patient population is clinically superior to other FDA approved ARS drugs in order to maintain the exclusive approval of Libervant in this age and indication. Even if we maintain our market access approval of Libervant for this age group in this indication, if we fail to receive U.S. orphan drug market exclusivity for Libervant for this age group in this indication, our ability to prevent competitors from manufacturing, marketing and selling competing products will be materially impaired, and our results of operations and financial condition may be significantly adversely affected. 

C linical trials may be delayed, suspended or terminated for many reasons, which will increase our expenses and delay the time it takes to develop our product candidates. 

We may experience delays in our ongoing or future preclinical trials, and we do not know whether future preclinical studies or clinical trials will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll an adequate number of patients on time or be completed on schedule. The commencement and completion of clinical trials for our clinical product candidates may be delayed suspended or terminated as a result of many factors, including: 

&#8226; the FDA disagreeing as to the design, protocol or implementation of our clinical studies; 

&#8226; the delay or refusal of regulators or IRBs, to authorize us to commence a clinical trial at a prospective trial site; 

&#8226; changes in regulatory requirements, policies and guidelines; 

&#8226; delays or failure to reach an agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs, and clinical trial sites; 

&#8226; the inability to enroll or delays in enrolling a sufficient number of patients in trials, particularly in orphan indications, to observe statistically significant treatment effects in the trial; 

&#8226; having clinical sites deviate from the trial protocol; 

&#8226; negative or inconclusive results from ongoing preclinical studies or clinical trials, which may require us to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials or to abandon projects that we had expected to be promising; 

&#8226; reports from preclinical testing of other similar therapies that raise safety or efficacy concerns; 

&#8226; regulators or IRBs requiring that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or safety concerns, among others; 

&#8226; lower than anticipated retention rates of patients and volunteers in clinical trials; 

&#8226; our CROs or clinical trial sites failing to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all, deviating from the protocol or dropping out of a trial; 

&#8226; delays in establishing the appropriate dosage levels; and 

&#8226; exceeding budgeted costs due to difficulty in accurately predicting costs associated with clinical trials. 

If we experience delays in the commencement or completion of any clinical trial of our product candidates, or if any clinical trials suspended or terminated, our costs may substantially increase and the commercial prospects of our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate revenue from sales of any product candidate will be delayed or not realized at all. Significant preclinical study or clinical trial delays also could shorten the period during which we have exclusive rights to commercialize a product candidate or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to successfully commercialize a product candidate. 

We have limited commercialization experience and may lack the necessary expertise, personnel and resources to successfully commercialize our other product candidates that must first receive regulatory approval, either on our own or together with collaborators. 

We rely on our third-party licensees to commercialize our multiple licensed products and to date have only marketed, through our own efforts and with the services of third-party outsourcing vendors, including contract sales personnel, our first self-developed product, Sympazan, launched in December 2018. With the license of Sympazan to Assertio in October 2022, we scaled back many of our commercial operations, including elimination of our sales and marketing force. However, in April 2024, we launched Libervant for ARS patients between two and five years of age. Given our limited history of direct experience in commercializing product candidates, and current limited commercial operations, we have no long-term experience upon which to measure our ability or success in commercializing future product candidates, if approved, or our ability to make predictions about financial results or prospects of any future launches of product candidates, if approved. 

Our ongoing commercial strategy for our product candidates involves the development of a commercial infrastructure that spans multiple jurisdictions and is dependent upon our ability to build an infrastructure that is capable of implementing our commercial product launch strategy. The establishment and development of our commercial infrastructure will be expensive and time consuming, and we may not be able to develop our commercial infrastructure successfully or in a timely manner, or at all. Doing so will require a high degree of coordination and compliance with laws and regulations in numerous territories, including in the United States, each state, and other countries in which we do business, including restrictions on advertising practices, enforcement of intellectual property rights, restrictions on pricing or discounts, transparency laws and regulations, and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs. If we are unable to effectively coordinate such activities or comply with such laws and regulations, our ability to commercialize our product candidates in the United States and other jurisdictions in which they are or may be available will be materially adversely affected. 

We also intend to enter into strategic licenses with third parties to commercialize our product candidates. We may have difficulty establishing relationships with third parties on terms that are acceptable to us, or in all of the regions where we wish to commercialize our products, or at all. If we are unable to build our own distribution and marketing capabilities or to find suitable licensees for the commercialization of our products and product candidates, if approved, we may have difficulties generating revenue from them and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects and the trading price of our stock may be materially adversely affected. 

Our success depends upon attaining significant market acceptance of our licensed products and proprietary products and product candidates, if approved, among patients, physicians, pharmacists and the medical community. 

It is possible that we may not complete development of our product candidates or obtain regulatory approval for those product candidates. Even if we do complete development and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our product candidates may not gain market acceptance among patients, physicians, nurses, pharmacists, the medical community or third-party payors, which is critical to commercial success. Market acceptance of our products and any product candidate for which we receive approval depends on a number of factors, including: 

&#8226; the timing of market introduction of the product candidate as well as competitive products; 

&#8226; the clinical indications for which the product candidate is approved; 

&#8226; the potential and perceived advantages of such product candidate over alternative treatments; 

&#8226; favorable pricing and the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors and government authorities; 

&#8226; relative convenience and ease of administration; 

&#8226; any negative publicity related to our or our competitors&#8217; products that include the same active ingredient; 

&#8226; the prevalence and severity of adverse side effects, including limitations or warnings contained in a product&#8217;s FDA-approved labeling; and 

&#8226; the effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts. 

Even if a potential product displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile in clinical trials, market acceptance of the product will not be known until a period of time after it is launched. If our products or product candidates, if approved, fail to achieve an adequate level of acceptance by patients, physicians, nurses, pharmacists, the medical community or third-party payors, we will be unable to generate significant revenues, and we may not become or remain profitable. 

In addition, the potential market opportunities for our product candidates are difficult to estimate. Our estimates of the potential market opportunities are predicated on several key assumptions such as industry knowledge and publications, third-party research reports or analyses and other analytical information. While we believe that our internal assumptions are reasonable, these assumptions may be inaccurate. If any of the assumptions proves to be inaccurate, then the actual market for our product candidates could be smaller than our estimates of the potential market opportunity. If the actual market for our product candidates is smaller than we expect, or if the products fail to achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, health care payors and patients, our revenue from product sales may be limited and we may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability. 

Further, we may not be able to hire or contract for a sales force that is sufficient in size or has adequate expertise in the medical markets that we intend to target for our product candidates in the future. Any failure or delay in the development of our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities would adversely impact the commercialization of our product candidates, if approved. 

Regulatory approval for any approved product is limited by the FDA to those specific indications and conditions for which clinical safety and efficacy have been demonstrated, and any allegations of our failure to comply with such approved indications could limit our sales efforts and have a material adverse effect on our business. 

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of prescription drugs. These regulations include standards and restrictions for direct-to-consumer advertising, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, promotional activities involving the internet and off-label promotion. Any regulatory approval that the FDA grants is limited to those specific diseases and indications for which a product is deemed to be safe and effective by the FDA. In addition to the FDA approval required for new formulations, any new indication for an approved product also requires FDA approval. If we are not able to obtain FDA approval for any desired future indications for our products and product candidates, our ability to effectively market and sell our products may be reduced and our business may be materially adversely affected. 

While physicians in the U.S. may choose and are generally permitted to prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product&#8217;s labeling and for uses that differ from those tested in clinical trials and approved by the regulatory authorities, our ability to promote our products is narrowly limited to those indications that are specifically approved by the FDA. These &#8220;off-label&#8221; uses are common across medical specialties and may constitute an appropriate treatment for some patients in varied circumstances. Regulatory authorities in the U.S. generally do not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. Regulatory authorities do, however, restrict communications by pharmaceutical companies on the subject of off-label use. Promotional activities that fail to comply with the FDA&#8217;s regulations or guidelines may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, these authorities and may cause the FDA to issue warning letters or untitled letters, bring an enforcement actions, suspend or withdraw an approved product from the market, require a recall or institute fines, or could result in disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions or criminal prosecution, any of which could materially harm our reputation and our business significantly. 

We could incur substantial costs and disruption to our business and delays in the launch of our product candidates if our competitors and/or collaborators bring legal actions against us, which could harm our business and operating results. 

We cannot predict whether our competitors or potential competitors, some of whom we collaborate with, may bring legal action against us based on our research, development and commercialization activities, as well as any product candidates or products resulting from these activities, claiming, among other things, infringement of their intellectual property rights, breach of contract, false or disparaging statements about another company&#8217;s products or product candidates, or other legal theories. To date we have been subject to a number of claims of this nature. In defending such lawsuits, whether or not they are with or without merit or are ultimately determined in our favor, we would continue to face costly litigation and diversion of 

technical and management personnel. These lawsuits could hinder our ability to enter the market early with our product candidates and thereby hinder our ability to influence usage patterns when fewer, if any, of our potential competitors have entered the market, which could adversely impact our potential revenue from such product candidates. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do and could be able to sustain the cost of litigation to a greater extent and for longer periods of time than we can. Furthermore, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us: to pay damages, potentially including treble damages and attorneys&#8217; fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party&#8217;s patent or other intellectual property rights; to cease making, licensing or using products that are alleged to incorporate or make use of the intellectual property of others; to expend additional development resources to reformulate our products or prevent us from marketing a product; and to enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the rights to use necessary technologies. 

Guidelines and recommendations published by government agencies can reduce the use of our products or product candidates. 

Government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines applicable to certain drug classes which may include our products and product candidates. Regulations and guidelines of government agencies may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of concomitant therapies. Regulations or guidelines suggesting the reduced use of certain drug classes which may include our products and product candidates or the use of competitive or alternative products as the standard of care to be followed by patients and healthcare providers could result in decreased use of our products or product candidates or negatively impact our ability to gain market acceptance and market share. For example, Suboxone, which treats opioid addiction, has as one of its active ingredients an opioid, buprenorphine. Revisions to regulations or guidelines suggesting the reduced use of opioid drugs such as buprenorphine could result in decreased use of Suboxone. 

We face significant competition from other pharmaceutical companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively. 

The pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We expect to have competitors both in the United States and internationally, including major multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and universities and other research institutions. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development staff and experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. As a result, these companies may obtain regulatory approval more rapidly than we are able and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these companies. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis drug products or drug administration technologies that are more effective than our products or product candidates. In addition, our competitors may file citizen petitions with the FDA in an attempt to persuade the FDA that our product candidates, or the clinical studies that support their approval, contain deficiencies. Such actions by our competitors could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any NDA that we submit under Section 505(b)(2) or other filing pathways. 

We believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on, among other things: 

&#8226; the efficacy and safety of our products and product candidates; 

&#8226; the time it takes for our product candidates to complete preclinical and clinical development and receive marketing approval; 

&#8226; our ability to maintain a good relationship with regulatory authorities; 

&#8226; our ability to commercialize and market any of our product candidates after receiving regulatory approval; 

&#8226; the price of our products relative to pricing of branded or generic competitors; 

&#8226; whether coverage and adequate levels of reimbursement are available under private and governmental health insurance plans, including Medicare and Medicaid; 

&#8226; our ability to protect intellectual property rights related to our products and product candidates; 

&#8226; our ability to manufacture on a cost-effective basis for our products and product candidates that receive regulatory approval; and 

&#8226; acceptance by physicians and other healthcare providers of any of our products and product candidates that receive regulatory approval. 

If our competitors&#8217; market products that are more effective, safer or less expensive than our product candidates, or that reach the market sooner than our product candidates, our products may enter the market too late in the cycle and may not achieve commercial success. In addition, the biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Because we have limited research and development capabilities, it may be difficult for us to stay abreast of the rapid changes in 

each technology. If we fail to stay at the forefront of technological change, we may be unable to compete effectively. Technological advances or products developed by our competitors may render our technologies or product candidates obsolete, less competitive or not economical. 

If we are unable to achieve and maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors for our licensed products or product candidates, if approved, their commercial success may be severely hindered. 

Successful commercialization of our licensed products and product candidates, if approved, will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement are available from third-party payors, including governmental healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, and how quickly such coverage and reimbursement can be obtained, if obtained at all. Third-party payors determine which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. Reimbursement decisions by third-party payors depend upon a number of factors, including, among other things, each third-party payor&#8217;s determination that use of a product is: 

&#8226; a covered benefit under its health plan; 

&#8226; appropriate and medically necessary for the specific condition or disease; 

&#8226; cost effective; and 

&#8226; neither experimental nor investigational. 

Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval from third-party payors may be a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data, including results from expensive pharmacoeconomic studies, beyond the data required to obtain marketing approval, to each third-party payor. There is no guarantee that we will be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement. 

Cost containment is a primary concern of the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere as well as for governmental authorities. Third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services. Third-party payors may deny reimbursement for covered products if they determine that a medical product was not used in accordance with third-party payor coverage policies, such as required procedures for cost-effective diagnosis methods and other conditions that must be met before the third-party payor will provide coverage for use of a product. For example, insurers may establish a &#8220;step-edit&#8221; system that requires a patient to first use a lower price alternative product prior to becoming eligible for reimbursement of a higher price product. Third-party payors also may refuse to reimburse for drugs, procedures and devices deemed to be experimental, or that are prescribed for an unapproved indication. It is also possible that a third-party payor may consider our products or product candidates as substitutable by less expensive therapies and only offer to reimburse patients for the less expensive product. Even if we show improved efficacy or improved convenience of administration with our products or product candidates, pricing of existing drugs may limit the amount that can be charged for our licensed products or product candidates. These payors may deny or revoke the reimbursement status of a given product or establish prices for new or existing marketed products at levels that are too low to enable us to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development. Further, third-party payors may also limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Further, some third-party payors challenge the prices charged for medical products and may impose price controls or require that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices. 

Obtaining and maintaining reimbursement status is time-consuming and costly. No uniform policy for coverage reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is generally a time-consuming and costly process that requires us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. Furthermore, rules and regulations regarding reimbursement change frequently, in some cases on short notice, and we believe that changes in these rules and regulations are likely. 

The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Levels of reimbursement may also decrease in the future, and future legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payors may adversely affect the reimbursement available for and the pricing of our product candidates, once approved, which in turn, could negatively impact the demand for our product candidates. If payors are not adequately reimbursed for our licensed products or product candidates, they may reduce or discontinue purchases of them, which would result in a significant shortfall in achieving revenue expectations and negatively impact our business, prospects and financial condition. 

Our relationships with customers, physicians, and third-party payors will be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, health information privacy and security laws, and other healthcare laws and regulations. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties. 

Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any licensed products currently marketed and any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval in the future. Our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors may subject us to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws and other healthcare laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and the law commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act and regulations promulgated thereunder. These laws will impact, among other things, our clinical research programs and our proposed sales, marketing and educational programs for our product candidates, if approved. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy laws by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct or may conduct our business. The laws that will affect our operations include, but are not limited to: 

&#8226; the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in return for the purchase, recommendation, leasing or furnishing of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand, and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Under the PPACA a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it and action that may be customary in other industries ma unintentionally violate the Anti-Kickback Statute; 

&#8226; federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including, without limitation, the False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalty laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval from Medicare, Medicaid or other government payors that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The PPACA provides, and recent government cases against pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers support, the view that federal Anti-Kickback Statute violations and certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may implicate the False Claims Act; 

&#8226; HIPAA created federal criminal statutes that prohibit a person from knowingly and willfully executing a scheme or making false or fraudulent statements to defraud any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor ( e.g., public or private); 

&#8226; HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization on entities subject to the rule, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, and their respective business associates who provide services involving the creation, use or disclosure of HIPAA protected health information; 

&#8226; federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which is part of the PPACA, that require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to: (i) payments or other &#8220;transfers of value&#8221; made to physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, certified nurse-midwives and teaching hospitals; and (ii) certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members, with such information being made publicly available through a searchable website; 

&#8226; state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws; state laws that require manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, marketing expenditures, or pricing information; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry&#8217;s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or to adopt compliance programs as prescribed by state laws and regulations, or that otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; and state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and 

&#8226; state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. 

It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. 

The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and the provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management&#8217;s attention from the operation of our business. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements. 

Recently enacted and future healthcare reform legislation or regulation may increase the difficulty and cost for us and any future collaborators to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and may adversely affect the prices we, or they, may obtain and may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. 

In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could, among other things, prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability, or the ability of any future collaborators, to profitably sell any products for which we, or they, obtain marketing approval. Among policymakers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we, or any future collaborators, may receive for any approved products. In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the PPACA. Among the provisions of the PPACA of importance to our business, including our ability to commercialize and the prices we may obtain for any of our products and product candidates that are approved for sale, are the following: 

&#8226; an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs, although this fee does not apply to sales of certain products approved exclusively for orphan indications; 

&#8226; expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer&#8217;s Medicaid rebate liability; 

&#8226; expansion of manufacturers&#8217; rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of &#8220;average manufacturer price,&#8221; or AMP, for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices and extending rebate liability to prescriptions for individuals enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans; 

&#8226; addition of more entity types eligible for participation in the Public Health Service 340B drug pricing program, or the 340B program; 

&#8226; a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and 

&#8226; establishment of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. 

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. For example, beginning April 1, 2013, Medicare payments for all items and services, including drugs and biologics, were reduced by 2% under the sequestration ( i.e., automatic spending reductions) required by the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. Subsequent legislation, including the BBA, extended the 2% reduction, on average, to 2032, subject to additional Congressional action. Sequestration may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and, if we obtain regulatory approvals, may otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for our product candidates or the frequency with which our product candidates may be prescribed or used if approved. Additional changes that may affect our business include the expansion of new programs such as Medicare payment for performance initiatives for 

physicians under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA). The introduction of the Medicare quality payment program has shifted the focus of physician reimbursement from volume to value, encouraging higher quality and more cost-effective care. 

Further, legislative changes to or regulatory changes under the PPACA remain possible in the U.S. Congress and under the second-term Trump administration. The nature and extent of any legislative or regulatory changes to the PPACA, including repeal and replacement initiatives, are uncertain at this time. It is possible that the PPACA repeal and replacement initiatives, if enacted into law, could ultimately result in fewer individuals having health insurance coverage or in individuals having insurance coverage with less generous benefits, including limited coverage for drugs. While Congress has not passed repeal legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (&#8220;TCJA&#8221;), which was signed into law by President Trump during his first administration, effectively eliminated the federal &#8220;individual mandate&#8221; penalty imposed by the PPACA on individuals who failed to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year. Shortly thereafter, the BBA amended the PPACA to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the &#8220;donut hole.&#8221; The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which was signed into law by President Biden, has since eliminated the coverage gap and replaced it with a $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket spending for covered drugs. As the second Trump presidency has commenced, we will continue to evaluate the impact of the PPACA on our business, and the potential for its further repeal or replacement. 

The costs of prescription pharmaceuticals in the United States have also been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States, and members of Congress and the administration have stated that they will address such costs through new legislative and administrative measures. This focus has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. In 2022, the Biden administration signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act, which included a number of significant drug pricing reforms, including the establishment of a drug price negotiation program within the HHS that, starting in 2026, will require manufacturers to charge a negotiated &#8220;maximum fair price&#8221; for certain selected drugs or pay an excise tax for noncompliance; the establishment, beginning in 2023, of rebate payment requirements on manufacturers under Medicare Parts B and D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation; and a redesign of the Part D benefit, as part of which manufacturers are required to provide discounts on Part D drugs, beginning in 2025. Additionally, President Biden issued a subsequent Executive Order directing the Secretary of the HHS consider whether new payment and delivery models would lower drug costs, though, on the first day of his second term, President Trump repealed that Executive Order. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 

We expect that we may experience more rigorous coverage criteria and additional downward pricing pressure as the result of these and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our drugs. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures. Additionally, policy changes resulting from the new presidential administration may create sudden and unexpected shifts in the operations of HHS that might impact both existing and planned operations. 

The pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is also subject to governmental control outside the United States. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidates to other available product candidates. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our ability to generate revenues and become profitable could be impaired. 

Risks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties 

We rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business could be substantially harmed. 

We have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon third-party CROs to monitor and manage data for our preclinical and clinical programs. We rely on these parties for execution of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs are required to comply with FDA laws and regulations regarding current good clinical practice, or GCP, which are also required by the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in the form of International Conference on Harmonization, or 

ICH, guidelines for all of our products in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce GCP through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCP, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under the current cGMP regulations. While we have agreements governing activities of our CROs, we have limited influence over their actual performance. In addition, portions of the clinical trials for our product candidates are expected to be conducted outside of the United States, which will make it more difficult for us to monitor CROs and visit clinical trial sites and will force us to rely heavily on CROs to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials and compliance with applicable regulations, including GCP. Failure to comply with applicable regulations in the conduct of the clinical trials for our product candidates may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. 

Some of our CROs have an ability to terminate their respective agreements with us if, among other reasons, it can be reasonably demonstrated that the safety of the subjects participating in our clinical trials warrants such termination, if we make a general assignment for the benefit of our creditors or if we are liquidated. If any of our relationships with these third-party CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, our CROs are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such CROs, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our preclinical and clinical programs. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. Consequently, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase substantially and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed significantly. 

Switching or adding additional CROs involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we strive to manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects. 

We rely on limited sources of supply for our thin film foil, and any disruption in the chain of supply may impact production and sales and cause delay in developing and commercializing our proprietary PharmFilm Technology product candidates. 

We currently have relationships with two third parties for the manufacture of our thin film foil. Because of the unique equipment and process for manufacturing our thin film foil, transferring manufacturing activities for our foil to an alternate supplier would be a time-consuming and costly endeavor, and there are only a limited number of manufacturers that we believe are capable of performing this function for us. Switching thin film foil suppliers may involve substantial cost and could result in a delay in our desired clinical and commercial timelines. If any of our thin film foil manufacturers breach or terminate their agreements with us, we would need to identify an alternative source for the thin film foil manufacture and supply of foil to us for the development and commercialization of the applicable products. Identifying an appropriately qualified source of alternative thin film foil supply for any one or more of these product candidates could be time consuming, and we may not be able to do so without incurring material delays in the development and commercialization of our product candidates, or in satisfying our manufacturing and supply commitments and obligations for our licensed products, which could harm our financial position, the commercial potential for our licensed products and product candidates, and our results of operations, as well as to result in a default in our supply commitments and obligations. Any alternative thin film foil vendor would also need to be qualified through an NDA supplement which could result in further delay. The FDA or other regulatory agencies outside of the United States may also require additional studies if we appoint a new manufacturer for supply of our licensed products that differs from the manufacturer used for clinical development of such products. For our product candidates, we expect that only one supplier will initially be qualified as a vendor with the FDA. If supply from the approved vendor is interrupted, there could be a significant disruption in our development and supply activities. 

These factors could cause the delay of clinical trials, regulatory submissions, required approvals or commercialization of our approved products and product candidates, cause us to incur higher costs and prevent successful commercialization of our licensed products and product candidates, if approved. Furthermore, if our suppliers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities of components and active pharmaceutical ingredient on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, and we are unable to secure one or more replacement suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, we would likely be in default in our supply obligations, which could result in the termination of our supply agreements, our incurring potential default damages and our loss of significant revenues. 

We rely on third parties to manufacture API for our licensed products and product candidates, and we intend to rely on third parties to manufacture the API for other approved products. The commercialization of any of our licensed products and product candidates, if approved, could be stopped, delayed or made less profitable if those third parties fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of API or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices or fail to maintain or achieve satisfactory regulatory compliance. 

We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to manufacture API for our licensed products and our product candidates, and control only certain aspects of their activities. 

Any of these third parties may terminate their engagements with us at any time. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, it could delay our supply of licensed products, proprietary product candidate programs and commercialization activities. Our reliance on these third parties reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibility to ensure compliance with all required legal, regulatory and scientific standards and any applicable trial protocols or our obligations under our product supply commitments and obligations. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we will not be able to complete, or may be delayed in completing, clinical trials required to support future regulatory submissions and approval of our product candidates and we would likely be in default in our supply commitments and obligations for our licensed products, which could result in the termination of our supply agreements, our incurring potential default damages and our loss of significant revenues. 

The facilities used by us, and by our third-party API manufacturers, to manufacture our licensed products and product candidates must maintain a compliance status acceptable to the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit our NDA to the FDA. If we or any of our third-party API manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the applicable regulatory authorities&#8217; strict regulatory requirements, or pass regulatory inspection, we or they will not be able to secure or maintain regulatory approval for the manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have no control over the ability of third-party API manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. Further, as we scale up manufacturing of our product candidates and conduct required stability testing, product, packaging, equipment and process-related issues may require refinement or resolution in order for us to proceed with our planned clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for commercialization of our product candidates. In the future, for example, we may identify impurities in the product manufactured by us or for us for commercial supply, which could result in increased scrutiny by the regulatory agencies, delays in our clinical program and regulatory approval, increases in our operating expenses, or failure to obtain or maintain approval for our licensed products and product candidates. If the FDA or any other applicable regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our products or if they withdraw any such approval in the future, or if our suppliers or third-party manufacturers decide they no longer want to manufacture our products, we would need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates and which could also result in default in our supply commitments and obligations for our licensed products, our incurring potential default damages and our loss of significant revenues. 

More generally, we and our API manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, may often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up and validating initial production. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product, quality assurance testing, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. Additionally, we and our API manufacturers may experience manufacturing difficulties due to resource constraints or as a result of labor disputes or unstable political environments, such as recent events in Ukraine and Russia, or other geopolitical uncertainty. If we or our manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties, or otherwise fail to comply with their contractual obligations, our ability to manufacture our products, or to make our product candidates available for clinical trials and development purposes or to further commercialize any of our licensed products and product candidates in the United States, would be jeopardized. Any delay or interruption in our ability to meet commercial demand may result in the loss of significant potential revenues and could adversely affect our ability to gain market acceptance for approved products as well as a potential default of our supply commitments or obligations. In addition, any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial supplies could delay the completion of clinical trials, increase the costs associated with maintaining clinical trial programs and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new clinical trials at additional expense or terminate clinical trials completely. Additionally, if supply from one approved API manufacturer is interrupted, there could be a significant disruption in commercial supply. Regulatory agencies may also require additional studies if a new manufacturer is relied upon for commercial production. Switching manufacturers may involve substantial costs and would likely result in a delay in our desired clinical and commercial timelines and disrupt our supply commitment and obligations. 

The occurrence of any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. 

The design, development, manufacture, supply, and distribution of our licensed products and our product candidates is highly regulated and technically complex. 

All entities involved in the preparation of therapeutics for clinical trials or commercial sale are subject to extensive regulation. Components of a finished therapeutic product approved for commercial sale or used in late-stage clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP and equivalent foreign standards. These regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures (including record keeping) and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of investigational products and products approved for sale. Poor control of production processes can lead to the introduction of adventitious agents or other contaminants, or to inadvertent changes in the properties or stability of our product candidates that may not be detectable in final product testing. The development, manufacture, supply, and distribution of our products and our product candidates is highly regulated and technically complex. We, along with our third-party providers, must comply with all applicable regulatory requirements of the FDA and foreign authorities. 

We, or our API and component manufacturers, must supply all necessary documentation in support of our regulatory filings for our product candidates on a timely basis and must adhere to the FDA&#8217;s GLP and cGMP regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program, and the equivalent standards of the regulatory authorities in other countries. Any failure by us or by our third-party API or component manufacturers to comply with cGMP or failure to scale-up manufacturing processes, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities of product candidates in a timely manner, could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval of any of our product candidates. Our facilities and quality systems and the facilities and quality systems of some or all of our third-party API and component manufacturers must also pass a pre-approval inspection for compliance with the applicable regulations as a condition of regulatory approval of our product candidates or any of our other potential products. In addition, the regulatory authorities in any country may, at any time, audit or inspect a manufacturing facility involved with the preparation of our product candidates or our other potential products or the associated quality systems for compliance with the regulations applicable to the activities being conducted. If these facilities and quality systems do not pass a pre-approval plant inspection, FDA approval of our product candidates, or the equivalent approvals in other jurisdictions, will not be granted. 

Regulatory authorities also may, at any time following approval of a product for sale, inspect our manufacturing facilities or those of our third-party suppliers or contractors. If any such inspection identifies a failure to comply with applicable regulations or if a violation of our product specifications or applicable regulations occurs independent of such an inspection or audit, we or the relevant regulatory authority may require remedial measures that may be costly and/or time-consuming for us or a third-party to implement and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical trial or commercial sales of our approved products or the temporary or permanent closure of a facility. Any such remedial measures imposed upon us or third parties with whom we contract could materially harm our business. If we or any of our third-party API or component manufacturers fail to maintain regulatory compliance, the FDA can impose regulatory sanctions including, among other things, refusal to approve a pending NDA for a new drug product or revocation of a pre-existing approval. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially harmed resulting in a significant loss of revenues and results and resulting in a potential default in our supply commitments or obligations, which could lead to termination of our supply agreements, our incurrence of default damages and our loss of significant revenues. 

We may not be successful in establishing development and commercialization collaborations, which could adversely affect, and potentially prohibit, our ability to develop our product candidates. 

Because developing pharmaceutical products, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, establishing manufacturing capabilities and marketing approved products are expensive, we continue to explore collaborations or licensing arrangements with third parties that have available resources and experience both in the United States and in territories outside of the United States. We continue to explore selective collaborations with third parties for development and commercialization of our products and candidates both in and outside of the United States. We may, however, be unable to advance the development and/or commercialization of our products and product candidates in territories outside of the United States, which may limit the market potential for certain products and product candidates outside the U.S. 

In situations where we enter into a development and commercial collaborative arrangement for a product or product candidate, we may also seek to establish additional collaborations for development and commercialization in territories outside of those addressed by the first collaborative arrangement for such product or product candidate. There are a limited number of potential licensees, and we expect to face competition in seeking appropriate licensees. If we are unable to enter into any development and commercial collaborations and/or sales and marketing arrangements on acceptable terms, if at all, we may be unable to successfully develop and seek regulatory approval for our product or product candidates and/or effectively market and sell approved products, if any, in all of the territories outside of the United States where it may otherwise be valuable to do so. 

Whether we reach an agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator&#8217;s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator&#8217;s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the likelihood of approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, the potential market for the product or product candidate, the costs and complexities of delivering such product or 

product candidate to patients, competing products, and industry and market conditions generally. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. 

We may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain significant additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market and generate product revenue. 

We may not be successful in maintaining development and commercialization collaborations, and any collaborators may not devote sufficient resources to the development or commercialization of our products or product candidates or may otherwise fail in development or commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and successfully commercialize certain of our products and product candidates and our financial condition and operating results. 

When we establish collaborative arrangements, such collaboration may not ultimately be successful, which could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. If we collaborate with a third-party for development and commercialization of a product or product candidate, we can expect to relinquish some or all of the control over the future success of that product or product candidate to the third-party. It is possible that a third-party collaborator may not devote sufficient resources to the development or commercialization of our product or product candidate or may otherwise fail in development or commercialization efforts, in which event the development and commercialization of such product or product candidate could be delayed or terminated and our business could be substantially harmed. In addition, the terms of any collaboration or other arrangement that we establish may not prove to be favorable to us or may not be perceived as favorable, which may negatively impact the trading price of our Common Stock. In some cases, we may be responsible for continuing development of a product or product candidate or research program under a collaboration, and the payment we receive from our licensee may be insufficient to cover the cost of this development. Moreover, collaborations and sales and marketing arrangements are complex and time consuming to negotiate, document and implement, and they may require substantial resources to maintain. 

We are subject to a number of additional risks associated with our dependence on collaborations with third parties, the occurrence of which could cause our collaborative arrangements to fail, including that: 

&#8226; we may be required to undertake the expenditure of substantial operational, financial and management resources; 

&#8226; we may be required to issue equity securities that would dilute our stockholders&#8217; percentage of ownership; 

&#8226; we may be required to assume substantial actual or contingent liabilities; 

&#8226; strategic collaborators could terminate the arrangement or allow it to expire, which would delay the development and commercialization and may substantially increase the cost of developing and commercializing our products and product candidates; 

&#8226; business combinations of a strategic collaborator or significant changes in a strategic collaborator&#8217;s business strategy may affect a strategic collaborator&#8217;s willingness or ability to complete its obligations under any arrangement; 

&#8226; strategic collaborators could decide to move forward with a competing product or product candidate developed either independently or in collaboration with others, including our competitors; 

&#8226; collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected; 

&#8226; clinical trials conducted as part of any of these collaborations may not be successful; 

&#8226; collaborators may not actively or aggressively pursue development and commercialization of any product candidates that seek to achieve, or that achieves, regulatory approval; 

&#8226; we may not have access to or may be restricted from disclosing certain information regarding product candidates being developed or commercialized under a collaboration; 

&#8226; a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our product candidates that achieve regulatory approval may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of any such product candidate; and 

&#8226; collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability. 

If any such collaborations do not result in the successful development and commercialization of product candidates, or if one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, the development or commercialization of our products or product candidates could be delayed and our business and prospects harmed. All of the risks relating to product development, regulatory approval and commercialization apply to the activities of our existing and future collaborators. 

Additionally, conflicts may arise between us and our third-party collaborators, such as conflicts concerning the interpretation of clinical data, the achievement of milestones, the interpretation of financial provisions or the ownership of 

intellectual property developed during the collaboration. For example, our existing revenue streams are largely dependent on Indivior, which holds the global commercialization rights to our approved product, Suboxone. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, Indivior represented 62% and 80% of our total revenue, respectively. If any such conflicts were to arise with Indivior or any other third party collaborators, one or more of the following events could result, each of which could delay or prevent the development or commercialization of our product or product candidates and harm our business: 

&#8226; reductions in the payment of royalties or other payments we believe are due pursuant to the applicable collaborative arrangement; 

&#8226; actions taken by a third-party collaborator inside or outside our collaboration which could negatively impact our rights or benefits under our collaboration; 

&#8226; unwillingness on the part of a third-party collaborator to keep us informed regarding the progress of its development and commercialization activities or to permit public disclosure of the results of those activities; and 

&#8226; decision by our third-party collaborator to terminate or significantly reduce the relationship. 

Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Industry 

We may experience difficulties in managing growth if our business expands to meet future needs, which could disrupt our operations. 

Although it is not expected to be imminent, if we need to expand our business to meet demands in growth of our manufacturing operations in connection with the continued commercialization of Libervant for ARS patients aged between two and five years, and, if granted full U.S. market access, for commercialization of Libervant for older patients, and to accommodate the potential commercialization of Anaphylm in the first quarter 2026, if approved by the FDA, or other additions to our product pipeline in the future, we would expect to expand our employee base to increase our managerial, regulatory, compliance, scientific and engineering, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other resources and to hire more consultants and contractors. Future growth would impose significant additional responsibilities on our management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees, consultants, contractors and contract employees. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Future growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of our existing or future product candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate and/or grow revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our products and product candidates, if approved, and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth. 

In addition, any growth in our management team could add increased expense which we must absorb, without necessarily having commensurate growth in our revenues. Also, to date, we have only directly marketed two products in the market. If we commercialize and directly market Anaphylm, if approved for U.S. market access, this could require a significant upfront expense and create a rapid growth in our workforce. This increase in expense may negatively impact our results of operations and may add to our need for additional funds. 

Our licensed products and, if approved, product candidates, may give rise to potential product liability claims or false marketing claims, and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability. 

As a pharmaceutical company, we operate in a market that is subject to significant risk of liability. The sales of any of our licensed products and product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval and the use of our product candidates in clinical trials, if any, exposes us to the risk of product liability claims alleging adverse effects from such products or product candidates and false marketing claims relating to the commercialization of such products or product candidates. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies, others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products or product candidates, or governmental agencies. Suboxone, which treats opioid addiction, has as one of its active ingredients an opioid, buprenorphine. There can be no assurance that we will not become the target of claims relating to opioid addiction as have companies that market opioids. We have been named as a defendant with Indivior in product liability claims related to dental injuries for use of Suboxone. For more detailed information regarding these claims, s ee Part II Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 23, Contingencies to our financial statement s. Any product liability claims, or false marketing claims, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and future growth prospects. If we cannot successfully defend against product liability claims or false marketing claims, we could incur substantial liability and costs. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims or false marketing claims may result in: 

&#8226; impairment of our business reputation; 

&#8226; withdrawal of clinical study participants; 

&#8226; substantial costs due to litigation; 

&#8226; distraction of management&#8217;s attention from our primary business; 

&#8226; substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants; 

&#8226; the inability to commercialize our licensed products and product candidates; and 

&#8226; decreased demand for our licensed products or product candidates, if approved for commercial sale. 

We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage, and our existing or any future insurance policies or our own resources may not sufficiently cover claims for damages that we may receive in the future. 

Our business exposes us to potential product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in clinical development, manufacturing, marketing, sale and use of human therapeutic products. It is generally necessary for us to secure certain levels of insurance as a condition for the conduct of clinical trials and any sale or use of our products. We have procured product liability insurance with respect to the sale of our licensed products and all clinical trials performed to date for which we were responsible ( i.e., in respect of our internal product pipeline). Further, we may seek to expand our insurance coverage for our licensed products and our marketing and commercialization of any future approved product candidates as well as other risks related to our business. 

Our current product liability insurance coverage may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at an acceptable cost to us or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. The product liability claim against us with respect to Suboxone may make obtaining product liability insurance coverage at an acceptable cost more problematic. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated adverse effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and business. 

We rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cybersecurity incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively. 

Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of third parties with which we contract are vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. We have previously been the target of a phishing attack that resulted in unauthorized access to our email system. While our systems have been secured and strengthened, there can be no assurance that we will not experience cyber-attacks in the future, suffer indirect consequences from a cyber-attack on a third-party, or fail to anticipate, identify or offset threats of potential cyber-attacks or security breaches in a timely manner. This is especially so considering the nature of cyber-attack techniques, which change frequently, can be difficult to detect for extended periods of time and often are not recognized until they succeed. System failures, accidents or security breaches could cause interruptions in our operations and could result in a material disruption of our product development and clinical activities and business operations, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. The loss of product development or clinical trial data could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and our development programs and the development of our product candidates could be delayed. 

Business interruptions at our manufacturing facilities could delay us in the process of developing our product candidates. 

Our headquarters are located in Warren, New Jersey and we have manufacturing facilities in Portage, Indiana. If we encounter any disruptions to our operations at these sites or one were to shut down for any reason, including by fire, natural disaster, such as a hurricane, tornado or severe storm, power outage, systems failure, labor dispute or other unforeseen disruption, then we may be prevented from effectively operating our business. Our coverage for natural disasters may be somewhat limited for floods or earthquakes and we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance for any unexpected events to compensate us for losses that may occur. Any losses or damages we incur could have a material adverse effect on our business operations. 

Our research and development activities could be affected or delayed as a result of possible restrictions on animal testing. 

Certain laws and regulations require us to test our product candidates on animals before initiating clinical trials involving humans. Animal testing activities have been the subject of controversy and adverse publicity. Animal rights groups and other organizations and individuals have attempted to stop animal testing activities by pressing for legislation and regulation in these areas and by disrupting these activities through protests and other means. To the extent the activities of these groups are successful, our research and development activities may be interrupted, delayed or become more expensive. 

Our operations involve hazardous materials and we and third parties with whom we contract must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business. 

As a pharmaceutical company, we are subject to environmental and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the use of hazardous materials. The cost of compliance with health and safety regulations is substantial. Our business activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials. Our research and development activities involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials, including the components of our product candidates and other hazardous compounds. We and manufacturers and suppliers with whom we may contract are subject to laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. In some cases, these hazardous materials and various wastes resulting from their use are stored at our and our manufacturers&#8217; facilities pending their use and disposal. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials, which could cause an interruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations, environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. We cannot guarantee that the safety procedures utilized by third-party manufacturers and suppliers with whom we may contract will comply with the standards prescribed by laws and regulations or will eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed our resources and U.S. federal and state or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of certain materials and/or interrupt our business operations. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain of our future compliance. We do maintain environmental liability insurance coverage to mitigate our exposure in the event of an accident or environmental discharge. In the event that we may be held liable for any consequential damage and any resulting claims for damages, which may exceed our insured limits and financial resources, we may incur costs that may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and prospects, and the value of our shares. 

Risks Related to Government Regulation 

If the FDA does not conclude that our product candidates satisfy the requirements for the 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway, or if the requirements for approval of any of our product candidates under Section 505(b)(2) are not as we expect, the approval pathway for our product candidates will likely take significantly longer, cost significantly more and encounter significantly greater complications and risks than anticipated, and in any case may not be successful. 

We intend to seek FDA approval through the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for each of our product candidates described in this report. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, added Section 505(b)(2) to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies that were not conducted by or for the applicant. 

If the FDA does not allow us to pursue the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for our product candidates as anticipated, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials, provide additional data and information and meet additional standards for regulatory approval. If this were to occur, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval for our product candidates would likely substantially increase. Moreover, the inability to pursue the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway could result in new competitive products reaching the market faster than our product candidates, which could materially adversely impact our competitive position and prospects. Even if we are permitted to pursue the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for a product candidate, we cannot assure you that we will receive the requisite or timely approvals for commercialization of such product candidate. 

In addition, notwithstanding the approval of a number of products by the FDA under Section 505(b)(2) over the last few years, certain competitors and others have objected to the FDA&#8217;s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). We expect that our competitors could file citizens&#8217; petitions with the FDA in an attempt to persuade the FDA that our product candidates, or the clinical studies that support their approval, contain deficiencies. If the FDA&#8217;s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is successfully challenged, the FDA may be required to change its Section 505(b)(2) policies and practices, which could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any NDA that we submit under Section 505(b)(2). 

Our products or product candidates may cause adverse effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or limit the scope of any approved label or market acceptance, cause us to suspend or discontinue clinical trials, abandon product candidates, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any. 

As with many pharmaceutical and biological products, treatment with our products or product candidates may produce undesirable side effects or adverse reactions or events. Although the nature of our products or product candidates as containing active ingredients that have already been approved means that the side effects arising from the use of the active ingredient or class of drug in our products or product candidates is generally known, our products or product candidates may still cause undesirable side effects. These could be attributed to the active ingredient or class of drug or to our unique formulation of such products or product candidates, or other potentially harmful characteristics. Such characteristics could cause us, our IRBs, clinical trial sites, the FDA or other regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more 

restrictive label or the delay, denial or withdrawal of regulatory approval, which may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. 

Further, if any of our products cause serious or unexpected side effects after receiving market approval, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including: 

&#8226; regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or impose restrictions on its distribution; 

&#8226; the FDA may require implementation of a REMS; 

&#8226; regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications; 

&#8226; we may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional clinical studies; 

&#8226; we could be sued and held liable for substantial damages for harm caused to patients; and 

&#8226; our reputation may suffer. 

Any of the above described events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or product candidate, significantly affect our revenues and profitability from such products, and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our products and product candidates. 

Our business is subject to extensive regulatory requirements and our approved products and product candidates that obtain regulatory approval will be subject to ongoing and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant expense and limit our ability to commercialize such products. 

Even after a product is approved, we will remain subject to ongoing FDA and other regulatory requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, import, export, record-keeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information. The holder of an approved NDA is obligated to monitor and report adverse events, or AEs, and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA. The holder of an approved NDA must also submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. Advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules and are subject to FDA review, in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws. In addition, the FDA may impose significant restrictions on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or on the conditions of approval. For example, a product&#8217;s approval may contain requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product, or the imposition of a REMS program. 

The holder of an NDA is subject to payment of user fees and adherence to commitments made in the NDA. A manufacturer is also subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMPs. If we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions relative to that product or the manufacturing facility, including requiring product recall, notice to physicians, withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing. 

If we or our products or product candidates or our manufacturing facilities fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may: 

&#8226; issue warning letters or untitled letters asserting that we are in violation of the law; 

&#8226; impose restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product; 

&#8226; seek an injunction or impose civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, assess monetary fines, require disgorgement, consider exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs and require curtailment or restructuring of our operations; 

&#8226; suspend or withdraw regulatory approval; 

&#8226; suspend any ongoing clinical trials; 

&#8226; refuse to approve a pending NDA or supplements to an NDA submitted by us; 

&#8226; seize product; or 

&#8226; refuse to allow us to enter into government contracts. 

Similar post-market requirements may apply in foreign jurisdictions in which we may seek approval of our products. Any government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to market our products or commercialize our product candidates and generate revenues. 

In addition, the FDA&#8217;s regulations, policies or guidance may change and new or additional statutes or government regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates or further restrict or regulate post-approval activities. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from pending or future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are not able to achieve and maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market or 

license our products and/or product candidates, which would materially adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability. 

Regulatory approval is required for each of our products in each jurisdiction in which we intend to market or license such products, and the inability to obtain such approvals would limit our ability to realize their full market potential. 

In order to market products outside of the United States, we or our licensees must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country. However, the failure to obtain regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may adversely impact the ability to obtain regulatory approval in another jurisdiction. Approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approval could result in difficulties and costs and require additional non-clinical studies or clinical trials which could be costly and time consuming. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in those countries. If we or our licensees fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, or if regulatory approval in international markets is delayed, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our products will be harmed. 

If we fail to develop, acquire or in-license other product candidates or products, our business and prospects will be limited. 

Our long-term growth strategy is to develop and commercialize a portfolio of product candidates in addition to our existing products and product candidates. We may also acquire or in-license early to mid-stage new chemical entities, or NCEs. Although we have internal research and development capacity that we believe will enable us to make improvements to existing compounds, we do not have internal drug discovery capabilities to identify and develop entirely new chemical entities or compounds. As a result, our primary means of expanding our pipeline of product candidates is to develop improved formulations and administration methods for existing FDA-approved products and/or select and acquire or in-license product candidates for the treatment of therapeutic indications that complement or augment our current targets, or that otherwise fit into our development or strategic plans on terms that are acceptable to us. Developing new formulations of existing products or identifying, selecting and acquiring or in-licensing promising product candidates requires substantial technical, financial and human resources expertise. Efforts to do so may not result in the actual development, acquisition or in-license of a particular product candidate, potentially resulting in a diversion of our management&#8217;s time and the expenditure of significant resources with no resulting benefit. If we are unable to add additional product candidates to our pipeline, our long-term business and prospects will be limited. 

Public concern regarding the safety of any of our drug products could result in the inclusion of unfavorable information in our labeling or require us to undertake other activities that may entail additional costs. 

Considering widely publicized events concerning the safety risk of certain drug products, the FDA, members of Congress, the Government Accountability Office, medical professionals and the general public have raised concerns about potential drug safety issues. These events have resulted in the withdrawal of drug products, revisions to drug labeling that further limit use of the drug products and the establishment of risk management programs that may, for example, restrict distribution of drug products after approval. The FDAAA, grants significant expanded authority to the FDA, much of which is aimed at improving the safety of drug products before and after approval. In particular, the FDAAA authorizes the FDA to, among other things, require post-approval studies and clinical trials, mandate changes to drug labeling to reflect new safety information and require risk evaluation and mitigation strategies for certain drugs, including certain currently approved drugs. The FDAAA also significantly expands the federal government&#8217;s clinical trial registry and results databank, which we expect will result in significantly increased government oversight of clinical trials. Under the FDAAA, companies that violate these and other provisions of this law are subject to substantial civil monetary penalties, among other regulatory, civil and criminal penalties. The increased attention to drug safety issues may result in a more cautious approach by the FDA in its review of data from our clinical trials. Data from clinical trials may receive greater scrutiny, particularly with respect to safety, which may make the FDA or other regulatory authorities more likely to require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. If the FDA requires us to provide additional clinical or preclinical data for any of our approved drug products, the indications for which that product candidate was approved may be limited or there may be specific warnings or limitations on dosing, and our efforts to commercialize any approved product may be otherwise adversely impacted. 

Uncertainty about presidential administration initiatives could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

T here is significant uncertainty with respect to legislation, regulation and government policy at the federal level, as well as the state and local levels. Recent events, including the 2024 U.S. presidential election, have created a climate of heightened uncertainty and introduced new and difficult-to-quantify macroeconomic and political risks with potentially far-reaching implications. The presidential administration&#8217;s changes to U.S. policy may impact, among other things, the U.S. and global economy, international trade and relations, unemployment, immigration, taxes, healthcare, the U.S. regulatory 

environment, inflation and other areas. Although we cannot predict the impact, if any, of these changes to our business, they could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Until we know what policy changes are made and how those changes impact our business and the business of our competitors over the long term, we will not know if, overall, we will benefit from them or be negatively affected by them. 

Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property 

If we are unable to obtain or protect intellectual property rights of any of our products and product candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market. 

We rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our products and our product candidates. The issuance, scope, validity, enforceability, strength and commercial value of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. The patent applications that we own, or in-license, may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover the products or product candidates, if approved, in the United States or in foreign countries or territories. If this were to occur, early generic competition could be expected against our products and product candidates, if approved. There may be relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications which could invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing based on a pending patent application. In particular, because the active pharmaceutical ingredients in many of our product candidates have been on the market as separate products for many years, it is possible that these products have previously been used off-label in such a manner that such prior usage would affect the validity of our patents or our ability to obtain patents based on our patent applications. 

The patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming. We or our licensors may not be able to prepare, file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications for a commercially reasonable cost or in a timely manner or in all jurisdictions. It is also possible that we or our licensors may fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them. Moreover, depending on the terms of any future in-licenses to which we may become a party, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology in-licensed from third parties. Therefore, these patents and patent applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. 

In addition to the protection afforded by patents, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce or which we choose not to seek to patent, and any other elements of our drug development and reformulation processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. Although we generally require all of our colleagues to assign their inventions to us, and we generally seek to have all of our colleagues, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed or that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors or other third parties. Additionally, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we may have insufficient recourse against third parties for misappropriating the trade secret. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information. For example, the FDA is considering whether to make additional information publicly available on a routine basis, including information that we may consider to be trade secrets or other proprietary information, and it is not clear at the present time how the FDA&#8217;s disclosure policies may change in the future, if at all. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the non-patented intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, and there is no guarantee that we will have any such enforceable trade secret protection, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

We may enjoy only limited geographical protection with respect to certain patents and we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world. 

Filing and prosecuting patent applications and defending patents covering our products or product candidates, if approved, in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our and our licensors&#8217; technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we and our licensors have patent protection, but enforcement rights are not as strong as those in the United States or Europe. These products may compete with our products or product candidates, and our and our licensors&#8217; patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. 

In addition, we may decide to abandon national and regional patent applications before grant. The examination of each national or regional patent application is an independent proceeding. As a result, patent applications in the same family may issue as patents in some jurisdictions, such as in the United States, but may issue as patents with claims of different scope or may even be refused in other jurisdictions. It is also quite common that depending on the country, the scope of patent protection may vary for the same product candidate or technology. 

The laws of some jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws or rules and regulations in the United States and Europe, and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in such jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in other jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing as patents, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license. Furthermore, while we intend to protect our intellectual property rights in our expected significant markets, we cannot ensure that we will be able to initiate or maintain similar efforts in all jurisdictions in which we may wish to market our product candidates. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates in all of our expected significant foreign markets. If we or our licensors encounter difficulties in protecting, or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting, the intellectual property rights important for our business in such jurisdictions, the value of these rights may be diminished, and we may face additional competition from others in those jurisdictions. 

Some countries also have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, some countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In those countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patents. If we or any of our licensors is forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may be impaired. 

Patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. 

Our ability to obtain patents is highly uncertain because, to date, some legal principles remain unresolved, there has not been a consistent policy regarding the breadth or interpretation of claims allowed in patents in the United States and the specific content of patents and patent applications that are necessary to support and interpret patent claims is highly uncertain due to the complex nature of the relevant legal, scientific and factual issues. Changes in either patent laws or interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection and could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 

The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on actions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce existing patents or patents that we might obtain in the future. Similarly, changes in patent law and regulations in other countries or jurisdictions or changes in the governmental bodies that enforce them or changes in how the relevant governmental authority enforces patent laws or regulations may weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce existing patents or patents that we may obtain in the future. 

Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad. For example, if the issuance to us, in a given country, of a patent covering an invention is not followed by the issuance, in other countries, of patents covering the same invention, or if any judicial interpretation of the validity, enforceability, or scope of the claims in, or the written description or enablement, in a patent issued in one country is not similar to the interpretation given to the corresponding patent issued in another country, our ability to protect our intellectual property in those countries may be limited. Changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may materially diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection. 

We have in the past and are likely in the future to be, involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents. These lawsuits are expensive and require us to expend substantial financial resources, are time consuming, may continue for many years for one or more claims and may be unsuccessful. 

Competitors may infringe our patents or the patents of any potential licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we have been, and in the future may be, required to file infringement claims, which are expensive and time-consuming. In an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensors is not valid or is unenforceable or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. 

Interference proceedings invoked by third parties or brought by us may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our collaborators or licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be significantly harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Our bringing or defending litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees from our core business. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. 

A number of our issued patents have been involved in administrative proceedings, such as reexamination and inter partes review at the USPTO and opposition at the EPO. The matters are resolved, but in possible future proceedings, there can be no assurance that all claims of the challenged patents will be upheld or that the patents challenged by us will be found infringed. We may lose any of the challenged patents entirely, or we may have to amend the scope of claims to an extent which may be considered insufficient to cover our products or product candidates. If any of those scenarios were to occur, we might lose our competitive advantage in our market, and our business could be materially affected. 

Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock. 

Third parties may commence legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a negative impact on the success of our business. 

Our commercial success depends, in part, upon our ability, and the ability of our existing and future collaborators, to develop, manufacture, market and sell our products and product candidates, if approved, and use our proprietary technologies without alleged or actual infringement, misappropriation or other violation of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There have been many lawsuits and other proceedings involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing product candidates. In addition, patent holding companies that focus solely on extracting royalties and settlements by enforcing patent rights may target us. 

We may have been and in the future may become party to or be threatened with adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products, product candidates and technology, which may include interference or derivation proceedings, post grant review and inter partes review before the USPTO or similar adversarial proceedings or litigation in any jurisdiction. Similarly, we or our licensors or collaborators have initiated, and in the future may initiate, such proceedings or litigation against third parties, which may include challenging the validity or scope of intellectual property rights controlled by third parties. Third parties have asserted and, in the future, may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future, regardless of their merit. There is a risk that additional third parties may choose to engage in litigation with us to enforce or to otherwise assert their patent rights against us. Even if we believe any of those claims are without merit, a court of competent jurisdiction could hold that these third-party patents are valid, enforceable and infringed, and the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such product or product candidates unless we obtain a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire or are finally determined to be invalid or unenforceable. Similarly, if any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our technology, holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product or product candidate unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires or is finally determined to be invalid, unenforceable or not infringed by our product or technology. In either case, such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may need or may choose to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In such event, we may be unable to 

further practice our technologies or develop and commercialize any of our product candidates at issue, which could significantly harm our business. 

Parties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates, if approved. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, could involve substantial litigation expense and a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. Third parties making such claims may have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to these legal actions than we or our licensors or collaborators can. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys&#8217; fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. 

The patents and patent applications that we have covering our products and product candidates are limited to specific formulations and manufacturing processes, and our market opportunity for our products and product candidates may be limited by the lack of patent protection for the active ingredients and by competition from other formulations and manufacturing processes, as well as administration methods that may be developed by competitors . 

We have obtained and continue to seek to obtain patent protection for our manufacturing technology, drug administering technology and our products and product candidates, including specific formulations and manufacturing processes, which may not be as effective as composition of matter coverage in preventing work-arounds by competitors. As a result, generic products that do not infringe the claims of our issued patents covering formulations and processes are, or may be, available while we are marketing our products. Competitors who obtain the requisite regulatory approval will be able to commercialize products with the same active ingredients as our products or product candidates so long as the competitors do not infringe any process, use or formulation patents that we have developed for our products or product candidates, subject to any regulatory exclusivity we may be able to obtain for our products. 

The number of patents and patent applications covering products containing the same active ingredient as our products or product candidates indicates that competitors have sought to develop and may seek to commercialize competing formulations that may not be covered by our patents and patent applications. The commercial opportunity for our products or product candidates could be significantly harmed if competitors are able to develop and commercialize alternative formulations of our products or product candidates that are different from ours and do not infringe our issued patents covering our products or use of our products. 

Suboxone, Zuplenz, Sympazan, Libervant and Emylif have been approved by the FDA, and other product candidates may be approved by the FDA in the future. As additional products of ours are on the market, one or more third parties may also challenge the patents that we control covering our products, which could result in the invalidation or unenforceability of some or all of the relevant patent claims of our issued patents covering our products. 

If we or one of our licensees initiated legal proceedings against a third-party to enforce a patent covering one of our products or product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim, and have in certain existing proceedings counterclaimed, that the patent covering our product or product candidate is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are common, and there are numerous grounds upon which a third-party can assert invalidity or unenforceability of a patent. Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, post-grant review, and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions ( e.g., opposition proceedings). Such proceedings could result in revocation of or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our products or product candidates. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we, our patent counsel and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our products or product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business. 

Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by government patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements. 

Periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other government fees on patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various government patent agencies outside of the United States over the lifetime of our owned and licensed patents and/or applications and any patent rights we may own or license in the future. We rely on our outside counsel or our licensees to monitor the status of these fees so that we may make required payments of these fees when due to non-U.S. patent agencies. The USPTO and various non-U.S. government patent agencies require compliance with several procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply and we are also dependent on our licensors to take the necessary action to comply with these requirements with respect to our licensed intellectual property. In many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. There are situations, however, 

in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patents or patent applications, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, potential competitors might be able to enter the market which could harm our business. 

Our drug development strategy relies heavily upon the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, which requires us to certify that we do not infringe upon third-party patents covering approved drugs. Such certifications typically result in third-party claims of intellectual property infringement, the defense of which will be costly and time-consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in any litigation may prevent or delay our development and commercialization efforts which would harm our business. 

Litigation or other proceedings to enforce or defend intellectual property rights are often complex in nature, may be very expensive and time-consuming, may divert our management&#8217;s attention from other aspects of our business and may result in unfavorable outcomes that could adversely impact our ability to launch and market our product candidates, or to prevent third parties from competing with our products and product candidates. 

There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions and inter party reexamination proceedings before the USPTO. Numerous United States and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we and our collaborators are developing product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties. 

Our commercial success depends in large part on our avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties for existing approved drug products. Because we utilize the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for the approval of our products and product candidates, we rely in whole or in part on studies conducted by third parties related to those approved drug products. As a result, upon filing with the FDA for approval of our product candidates, we will be required to certify to the FDA that either: (1) there is no patent information listed in the FDA&#8217;s Orange Book with respect to our NDA; (2) the patents listed in the Orange Book have expired; (3) the listed patents have not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patents are invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of our proposed drug product. When we submit a paragraph IV certification to the FDA, a notice of the paragraph IV certification must also be sent to the patent owner once our 505(b)(2) NDA is accepted for filing by the FDA. The third-party may then initiate a lawsuit against us to defend the patents identified in the notice. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of receipt of the notice automatically prevents the FDA from approving our NDA until the earliest of 30 months or the date on which the patent expires, the lawsuit is settled, or the court reaches a decision in the infringement lawsuit in our favor. If the third-party does not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the required 45-day period, our NDA will not be subject to the 30-month stay. 

In addition to paragraph IV litigation noted above, third-party owners of patents may generally assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations or methods of manufacture related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending or subsequently filed patent applications which may later result in issued patents that may be infringed by our products or product candidates. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our product candidates, including the formulation, any method or process involved in the manufacture of any of our product candidates, any molecules or intermediates formed during such manufacturing process or any other attribute of the final product itself, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize our product candidates unless we obtain a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire. In either case, such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 

Our success will depend in part on our ability to operate without infringing the intellectual property and proprietary rights of third parties. We cannot assure you that our business, products, product candidates and methods do not or will not infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. 

Parties making claims against us may request and/or obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates on a temporary or permanent basis. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, involves substantial litigation expense and could be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys&#8217; fees for willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, pay royalties or redesign our infringing products or manufacturing processes, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. We cannot predict whether any such license would be available at all or whether it would be available on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research, manufacture clinical trial supplies or allow commercialization of our product candidates. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that 

event, we would be unable to further develop and commercialize one or more of our products or product candidates, which could harm our business significantly. We cannot provide any assurances that third-party patents do not exist which might be enforced against our products or product candidates, resulting in either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or, with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation to third parties. 

We may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property. 

We may also be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other intellectual property. We may be subject to ownership disputes in the future arising, for example, from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation generally involves substantial costs and can be a distraction to management and other employees. 

If we are not able to obtain adequate trademark protection or regulatory approval for our brand names, we may be required to re-brand affected products, which could cause delays in getting such product to market, substantively impact successful commercialization of any such product and substantially increasing our costs. 

To protect our rights in any trademark we use or intend to use for our products or our product candidates, we may seek to register such trademarks. Trademark registration is territory-specific and we must apply for trademark registration in the United States as well as any other country where we intend to commercialize our product or product candidates. Failure to obtain trademark registrations may place our use of the trademarks at risk or make them subject to legal challenges, which could force us to choose alternative names for our product or product candidates. In addition, the FDA and other regulatory authorities outside the United States conduct independent reviews of proposed product names for pharmaceuticals, including an evaluation of the potential for confusion with other pharmaceutical product names for medications. These regulatory authorities may also object to a proposed product name if they believe the name inappropriately makes or implies a therapeutic claim. If the FDA or other regulatory authorities outside the United States object to any of our proposed product names, we may be required to adopt alternative names for our product or product candidates. If we adopt alternative names, either because of our inability to obtain a trademark registration or because of objections from regulatory authorities, we would lose the benefit of our existing trademark applications. As a result, we may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to adopt a new product name that would be registrable under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA and other regulatory authorities, which could adversely impact our product brand identity and successful commercialization of any product and increase our costs. Furthermore, we may not be able to build a successful brand identity for a new trademark in a timely manner or at all, which would limit our ability to commercialize our product or our product candidates. 

Intellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage. 

The degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations and may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative: 

&#8226; others may be able to make products that are similar to our products or product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed; 

&#8226; we or any potential future licensors might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions; 

&#8226; others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights; 

&#8226; it is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents; 

&#8226; issued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges by our competitors; 

&#8226; issued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may not provide coverage for all aspects of our products or product candidates in all countries; 

&#8226; our competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets; 

&#8226; we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; and 

&#8226; the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business. 

Should any of these events occur, they could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects. 

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock 

Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly, and these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline. 

We expect our operating results to continue to be subject to significant quarterly and annual fluctuations. These fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline. Our net loss and other operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including: 

&#8226; whether the FDA requires us to complete additional, unanticipated studies, trials or other activities prior to approving any of our current and future product candidates, which would likely delay any such approval; 

&#8226; our execution of other collaborative, licensing or similar arrangements and the timing of payments we may make or receive under these arrangements; 

&#8226; our limited cash resources and substantial indebtedness; 

&#8226; variations in the level of expenses related to our future development programs; 

&#8226; any product liability or intellectual property infringement lawsuit in which we may become involved; 

&#8226; delays in obtaining, failure to obtain, or adverse developments in obtaining FDA and other regulatory approval of our product candidates; 

&#8226; other regulatory developments affecting any of our other current and future product candidates, or the product candidates of our competitors; 

&#8226; the costs of pre-commercialization and commercialization of any of our approved products that we market ourselves; and 

&#8226; if any of our current or future product candidates receive regulatory approval, the level of underlying demand for such product candidate and wholesaler buying patterns. 

If our quarterly or annual operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our Common Stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly or annual fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially. 

Our largest stockholder and management own a significant percentage of our stock and may have the ability to effectively influence matters subject to stockholder approval. 

As of December 31, 2024, our executive officers and directors beneficially owned approximately 6.6% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, Bratton Capital Management L.P. and its affiliates beneficially owned, directly, approximately 10.8% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2024. Therefore, these stockholders may have, through their respective ownership positions, the ability to influence matters requiring stockholder approval, including elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents or approval of any merger, sale of assets or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our Common Stock that you may believe are in your best interest as one of our stockholders. 

Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. 

We have incurred substantial losses since the inception of our company and do not expect to become profitable in the near future, if ever. Under currently enacted federal income tax law, to the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses in future years, such unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, but our deductibility of such losses in a future year is generally limited to 80% of taxable income. Furthermore, under Section 382 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an &#8220;ownership change,&#8221; generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation&#8217;s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits, to offset its post-change income may be further limited. We believe that, with our initial public offering, we may have triggered an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; limitation. In addition, we have experienced and may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, including an ownership change as a result of the combined effect of our initial public offering and future equity offerings. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset United States federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. 

We do not intend to pay dividends on our Common Stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock. 

We have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our Common Stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock. 

Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us, or may increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, or remove our current management. 

Some provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management. These provisions include: 

&#8226; authorizing the issuance of &#8220;blank check&#8221; preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval; 

&#8226; limiting the removal of directors by the stockholders; 

&#8226; creating a classified board of directors; 

&#8226; establishing a supermajority stockholder vote requirement for amending certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and of our amended and restated bylaws; 

&#8226; prohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; 

&#8226; eliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and 

&#8226; establishing advance notice and other requirements, including compliance with the SEC Universal Proxy Rules, for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings. 

These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless such transactions are approved by our board of directors. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Further, other provisions of Delaware law may also discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us. 

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders&#8217; ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees. 

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or any other action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder&#8217;s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. 

General Risk Factors 

Public health threats such as a global pandemic, or widespread outbreak of infectious disease, similar to the COVID-19 pandemic, may create uncertainties about our future operating results and financial conditions. 

Public health threats, such as the COVID-19 or any other pandemic, may have an impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Prolonged volatility or significant disruption of global financial markets due in part to a public health threat could have a negative impact on our business and overall financial position. Other factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, increased operational costs associated with operating during and after a pandemic; evolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, increased labor costs, and recessionary pressures; capital and other resources needed to respond to a pandemic; along with the severity and duration of a pandemic. These risks and their impacts are difficult to predict and could continue to otherwise disrupt and adversely affect our operations and our financial performance. 

In addition, to the extent a global health crisis, epidemic or pandemic, such as theCOVID-19 pandemic, adversely affects our business, financial condition and results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section. 

Our future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. 

We are highly dependent on the principal members of our executive team and other key executives, the loss of whose services may adversely impact the achievement of our objectives. Any of our executive officers could leave our employment at any time. Recruiting and retaining other qualified employees for our business, including scientific and technical personnel, will also be critical to our success. Competition for skilled personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical companies for individuals with similar skill sets. In addition, failure to succeed in clinical studies may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel. The inability to recruit key executives or the loss of the services of any executive or key employee might impede the progress of our development and commercialization objectives. 

Under applicable employment laws, we may not be able to enforce covenants not to compete. 

Certain of our executive officers&#8217; employment agreements include covenants not to compete. These agreements prohibit our executive officers, if they cease working for us, from competing directly with us or working for our competitors for a limited period. We may be unable to enforce these agreements or may not be able to enforce these agreements to their full extent under applicable law. If we cannot demonstrate that our interests would be harmed by such competitive behavior, we may be unable to prevent our competitors from benefiting from the expertise of our former executives and our competitiveness may be diminished. 

Compliance with ever evolving federal, state, and foreign laws relating to handling of information about individuals involves significant expenditure and resources, and any failure by us or our vendors to comply may result in significant liability, negative publicity, and/or an erosion of trust, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 

We receive, store, handle, transmit, use and otherwise process information related to individuals. We also depend on a number of third-party vendors in relation to the operation of our business, a number of which process data on our behalf. We and our vendors are subject to a variety of federal, state and foreign data privacy laws, rules, regulations, industry standards and other requirements, including those that apply generally to the handling of information about individuals, and those that are specific to certain industries, sectors, contexts, or locations. These requirements, and their application, interpretation and amendment are constantly evolving and developing. 

In the United States, numerous federal and state laws, including state data breach notification laws and state health information privacy laws, govern the collection, use, and disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. The Federal Trade Commission and state regulators enforce a variety of data privacy issues, such as promises made in privacy policies or failures to appropriately protect information about individuals, as unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act or similar state laws. 

We are subject to HIPAA. HIPAA imposes privacy, security and breach notification obligations on certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform certain services that involve creating, receiving, maintaining or transmitting individually identifiable health information (&#8220;protected health information,&#8221; or &#8220;PHP&#8221;) for or on behalf of such covered entities, and their covered subcontractors. HIPAA requires covered entities and business associates to develop and maintain policies with respect to the protection of, use and disclosure of PHI, including the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information, and certain notification requirements in the event of a breach of unsecured PHI. 

Additionally, under HIPAA, covered entities must report breaches of unsecured PHI to affected individuals without unreasonable delay, not to exceed 60 days following discovery of the breach by a covered entity or its agents. Notification also must be made to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights, or OCR, and, in certain circumstances involving large breaches, to the media. Business associates must report breaches of unsecured PHI to covered entities within 60 days of discovery of the breach by the business associate or its agents. A non-permitted use or disclosure of PHI is presumed to be a breach under HIPAA unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the information has been compromised consistent with requirements enumerated in HIPAA. 

Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured PHI, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by HHS may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. HIPAA also authorizes state Attorneys General to file suit on behalf of their residents. Courts may award damages, costs and attorneys&#8217; fees related to violations of HIPAA in such cases. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to sue us in civil court for violations of HIPAA, its 

standards have been used as the basis for duty of care in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of PHI. 

Member states in the European Union and other countries have also adopted data protection laws and regulations which impose significant compliance obligations. For example, in the European Union, on May 25, 2018 the EU general Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) became applicable throughout the EU and, as a regulation, has direct effect in all member states. The GDR was designed to harmonize data privacy laws across the EU and change the way organizations approach data privacy. The GDPR introduced new obligations and expanded the extraterritorial reach of the EU data protection regime. It applies to (i) organizations that process personal data in the context of an establishment in the EU (regardless of whether the processing takes place in the EU) and (ii) organizations outside the EY that offer goods or services to data subjects in the EU, or that monitor the behavior of EU data subjects. Compliance with the GDPR involves significant obligations, including requirements around accountability and transparency, contracting with service providers that process personal data, responding to data subjects' rights requests within prescribed timelines, reporting of data breaches to data subjects and. or data protection or supervisory authorities, taking account of data protection as any new services are developed, and limiting the amount of personal data collected, stores or otherwise processed. These obligations and restrictions have a significant impact on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including in the context of health data from clinical trials. 

Even though we believe we and our vendors are generally in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to privacy and data security, these laws are in some cases relatively new and the interpretation and application of these laws are uncertain. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations, industry standards and other requirements could result in proceedings or actions against us by individuals, consumer rights groups, government agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs in investigating and defending such claims and, if found liable, pay significant damages or fines or be required to make changes to our business. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant negative publicity and an erosion of trust. If any of these events were to occur, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 

Our colleagues, principal investigators, consultants and agents may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading. 

We are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our colleagues, principal investigators, contract sales force, consultants and agents. Misconduct by these parties could include failure to: 

&#8226; comply with FDA regulations or the regulations applicable in other jurisdictions; 

&#8226; provide accurate information to the FDA and other regulatory authorities; 

&#8226; comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad; 

&#8226; report financial information or data accurately; or 

&#8226; disclose unauthorized activities to us. 

We may be subject to claims that our colleagues, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties. 

We employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We may be subject to claims that we or our colleagues, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information of our colleagues&#8217; former employers or other third parties. We may also be subject to claims that former employers or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. There is no guarantee of success in defending these claims and even if we are successful, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and other colleagues from our core business. 

The market price of our Common Stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for purchasers of our Common Stock. 

The market price of our Common Stock since our IPO has been and is likely to be volatile. The stock market in general and the market for biopharmaceutical or pharmaceutical companies in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, you may not be able to sell your Common Stock at or above your purchase price. The market price for our Common Stock may be influenced by many factors, including: 

&#8226; results of clinical trials of our current and any future product candidates or those of our competitors; 

&#8226; the success or regulatory approval of competitive drugs or therapies; 

&#8226; regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries, as to both our products and product candidates and those of our competitors; 

&#8226; developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights; 

&#8226; the recruitment or departure of key personnel; 

&#8226; the level of expenses related to our current and any future product candidates or clinical development programs; 

&#8226; the results of our efforts to discover, develop, acquire or in-license additional product candidates; 

&#8226; actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development, clinical trials or regulatory approval timelines or recommendations by securities analysts; 

&#8226; our inability to obtain or delays in obtaining adequate drug supply for any approved drug or inability to do so at acceptable prices; 

&#8226; disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies; 

&#8226; significant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation; 

&#8226; variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us, or our failure to achieve anticipated financial results or funding; 

&#8226; market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors; 

&#8226; inflation and rising interest rates; 

&#8226; general economic, industry and market conditions; and 

&#8226; the other factors described in this &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section. 

If securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they publish negative evaluations of our Company, the price of our Common Stock could decline. 

The trading market for our Common Stock relies, in part, on the research and reports that industry and financial analysts publish about us or our business. We currently have limited research coverage by industry and financial analysts. Should any analysts then covering our business downgrade their evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline. If any analysts then covering our business cease to cover our stock, we could lose visibility in the market for our stock, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. 

We are a &#8220;smaller reporting company&#8221;, and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our Common Stock less attractive to investors. 

We are a &#8220;smaller reporting company&#8221;, as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act which allows us to take advantage of many of the exemptions from disclosure requirements available to &#8220;emerging growth companies,&#8221; as defined in the JOBS Act, including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and certain reduced financial disclosures in our periodic reports, including this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We are eligible to remain a smaller reporting company for so long as we have a public float (based on our Common Stock equity) of less than $250 million measured as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or a public float (based on our Common Stock equity) of less than $700 million as of such date and annual revenues of less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. We cannot predict if investors will find our Common Stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our Common Stock less attractive as a result of these disclosure exemptions, there may be a less active trading market for our Common Stock and our stock price may be more volatile. 

If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our Common Stock. 

Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our Common Stock. 

Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock in the public market by our existing stockholders would cause our stock price to fall. 

Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock by our existing stockholders, including shares issued to colleagues and directors in respect of the termination of our Performance Unit Plans, or PUP Plans, in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our Common Stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that such sales may have on the prevailing market price of our Common Stock. 

Certain holders of our securities are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the Securities Act. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act has resulted in a substantial amount of these shares becoming freely 

tradable without restriction under the Securities Act. Any sales of securities by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our Common Stock. 

Adverse developments affecting the financial services industry could adversely affect our current and projected business operations and our financial conditions and results of operation. 

Adverse developments that affect financial institutions, such as events involving liquidity that are rumored or actual, have in the past and may in the future lead to bank failures and market-wide liquidity problems. Although the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC may take action to mitigate the risk of potential losses, widespread demands for customer withdrawals or other liquidity needs of financial institutions for immediate liquidity may exceed the capacity of such program. 

Although we assess our banking relationships as we believe necessary or appropriate, our access to cash in amounts adequate to finance or capitalization our current projected future business operations could be significantly impaired by factors that affect the financial institutions with which we have banking relationships, and in turn, us. These factors could include, among others, events such as liquidity constraints or failures, the ability to perform obligations under various types of financial, credit or liquidity agreements or arrangements, disruptions or instability in the financial services industry or financial markets, or concerns or negative expectations about the prospects for companies in the financial services industry. These factors could also include factors involving financial markets or the financial services industry generally. The results of events or concerns that involve one or more of these factors could include a variety of material and adverse impacts on our current and projected business operations and our financial condition and results of operations. These could include, but may not be limited to, delayed access to deposits or other financial assets or the uninsured loss of deposits or other financial assets; or termination of cash management arrangements and/or delays in accessing or actual loss of funds subject to cash management arrangements. 

In addition, widespread investor concerns regarding the U.S. or international financial systems could result in less favorable commercial financing terms, including higher interest rates or costs and tighter financial and operating covenants, or systemic limitations on access to credit and liquidity sources, thereby making it more difficult for us to acquire financing on acceptable terms or at all. Any decline in available funding or access to our cash and liquidity resources could, among other risks, adversely impact our ability to meet our operating expenses, financial obligations or fulfill our other obligations, result in breaches of our financial and/or contractual obligations or result in violations of federal or state wage and hour laws. Any of these impacts, or any other impacts resulting from the factors described above or other related or similar factors not described above, could have material adverse impacts on our liquidity and our current and/or projected business operations and financial condition and results of operations. 

In addition, a critical vendor or business partner could be adversely affected by any of the liquidity or other risks that are described above as factors, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our current and/or projected business operations and results of operations and financial condition. Any business partner or supplier bankruptcy or insolvency, or any breach or default by a business partner or supplier, or the loss of any significant business partner or supplier relationships, could result in material adverse impacts on our current and/or projected business operations and financial condition.

ATRO,ASTRONICS CORP,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/8063/000000806325000017/atro-20241231.htm," ITEM 1A. &#160; RISK FACTORS 

Our business faces many risks, and you should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this report, including the financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8 , Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , and discussion in Item 7 , Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , when deciding to invest in us. Any of the risks discussed below, or elsewhere in this report or in our other SEC filings, could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in the future. As a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. 

Market Risks 

The loss of Boeing as a major customer or a significant reduction in business with this customer would reduce our sales and earnings. In 2024, 2023, and 2022 we had a concentration of sales to Boeing representing approximately 10.2%, 11.0%, and 11.0% of our sales, respectively. Revenue earned from sales to Boeing may decline or fluctuate significantly in the future. We may not be able to offset any decline in sales from Boeing with sales from new customers or other existing customers. The loss of Boeing as a customer or a significant reduction in business with Boeing would significantly reduce our sales and earnings. Accordingly, a portion of our potential for success will depend on our continued ability to develop and manage our relationship with Boeing. 

The markets we serve are cyclical and sensitive to domestic and foreign economic conditions, conflicts and events, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate. The markets we serve are sensitive to fluctuations in general business cycles, global pandemics, domestic and foreign governmental tariffs, trade and monetary policies, national and international conflicts, and economic conditions and events. While both domestic air travel and international air travel utilizing primarily widebody aircraft have recovered from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, if a global health crisis similar to the COVID-19 pandemic were to occur in the future, we may find it difficult to access our existing financing or obtain additional financing and/or fund our operations and meet our debt service obligations. Any new pandemic or other future public health crisis could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

In our Aerospace segment, demand by the general aviation markets for our products is dependent upon several factors, including capital investment, product innovations, economic growth and wealth creation and technology upgrades. In addition, the commercial airline industry is highly cyclical, with significant downturns in the past and sensitivity to such things as fuel price increases, labor disputes, global economic conditions, availability of capital to fund new aircraft purchase and upgrades of existing aircraft and passenger demand. Any change in these factors could result in a further reduction in the amount of 

discretionary air travel and the ability of airlines to invest in new aircraft or to upgrade existing aircraft. Therefore, our business is directly affected by economic factors outside of our control and other trends that affect our customers in the commercial aerospace industry. These factors could reduce orders for new aircraft and could reduce airline investment in cabin upgrades for which we supply products, thus reducing our sales and profits. A reduction in air travel may also result in our commercial airline customers being unable to pay our invoices on a timely basis or at all. 

We are a supplier on various new aircraft programs just entering or expected to begin production in the future. As with any new program, there is risk as to whether the aircraft or program will be successful and accepted by the market. As is customary for our industry, we purchase inventory and invest in specific capital equipment to support our production requirements generally based on delivery schedules provided by our customer. If a program or aircraft is not successful, we may have to write-off all or a part of the inventory, accounts receivable and capital equipment related to the program. A write-off of these assets could result in a significant reduction of earnings and cause covenant violations relating to our debt agreements. This could result in our being unable to borrow additional funds under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility or being obliged to refinance or renegotiate our indebtedness on potentially unfavorable terms for us. 

In our Test Systems segment, the market for our products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment. In any one reporting period, a single customer or several customers may contribute to an even larger percentage of our consolidated sales. In addition, our ability to increase sales will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain orders from current or new significant customers. The opportunities to obtain orders from these customers may be limited, which may impair our ability to grow sales. We expect that sales of our Test Systems products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future. Additionally, demand for some of our test products is dependent upon certain factors, including government funding levels for our products, our ability to compete successfully for those contracts and our ability to develop products to satisfy the demands of our customers. A negative change in any of these factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 

Our products are sold in highly competitive markets. Some of our competitors are larger, more diversified corporations and have greater financial, marketing, production and research and development resources than we do. As a result, certain of our competitors may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns or other market changing events. Our operations and financial performance will be negatively impacted if our competitors: 

&#8226; develop products that are superior to our products; 

&#8226; develop products that are more competitively priced than our products; 

&#8226; develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services; or 

&#8226; adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies, such as generative artificial intelligence (&#8220;AI&#8221;), or evolving customer requirements. 

We believe that the principal points of competition in our markets are product quality, price, design and engineering capabilities, product development, conformity to customer specifications, quality of support after the sale, timeliness of delivery and effectiveness of the distribution organization. Maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing, customer service and support and our distribution networks. If we do not maintain, or are otherwise unable to maintain, sufficient resources to make these investments, or are not successful in maintaining our competitive position, our business operations and financial performance may be materially adversely affected. 

We depend on government contracts and subcontracts with defense prime contractors and subcontractors that may not be fully funded, may be terminated, or may be awarded to our competitors. The failure to be awarded these contracts, the failure to receive funding or the termination of one or more of these contracts could reduce our sales. Sales to the U.S. government and its prime contractors and subcontractors represent a significant portion of our business. The funding of these programs is generally subject to annual congressional appropriations, and presidential and congressional priorities are unpredictable and subject to change. We cannot be certain that current levels of congressional funding for programs involving our products or services will continue and that our business related to these products and services will not decline or increase at currently anticipated levels, or that we will not be subject to delays in the negotiation of contracts or increased costs due to changes in the funding of U.S. government programs or government shutdowns. In addition, government expenditures for defense programs may decline or these defense programs may be terminated. A decline in governmental expenditures, a change in spending priorities, or the U.S. government&#8217;s termination of existing contracts may result in a reduction in the volume of government contracts awarded to us. Furthermore, on government contracts for which we are a subcontractor and not the prime contractor, the U.S. government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise, irrespective of our performance as a subcontractor. Also, sales to the U.S. government and its contractors, as well as foreign military and government customers, either directly or as a subcontractor to other contractors, often use a competitive bidding process and 

have unique purchasing and delivery requirements, which often makes the timing of sales to these customers unpredictable. We have resources applied to specific government contracts, and if any of those contracts were terminated, we may incur substantial costs redeploying those resources and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows may be materially adversely affected. 

Contracting in the defense industry is subject to significant regulation, including rules related to bidding, billing and accounting kickbacks and false claims, and any non-compliance could subject us to fines and penalties or possible debarment. Like all government contractors, we are subject to risks associated with this contracting. These risks include the potential for substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation, which could materially reduce our sales and earnings. It could also result in our suspension or debarment from future government contracts, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 

Strategic Risks 

If we are unable to adapt to technological change, demand for our products may be reduced. The technologies related to our products have undergone, and in the future may undergo, significant changes. To succeed in the future, we will need to continue to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so successfully, if at all, or on a timely, cost effective, or repeatable basis. Our competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective than those we develop or that render our technology and products obsolete or noncompetitive. Furthermore, our products could become unmarketable if new industry standards emerge. We may have to modify our products significantly in the future to remain competitive, and new products we introduce may not be accepted by our customers. 

Our new product development efforts may not be successful, which could result in a reduction in our sales and earnings. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development of new products or product enhancements, and new products or product enhancements may not be accepted by our customers. Because it is difficult to predict the amount of time required and the costs involved in achieving certain research, development, and engineering objectives, the development expenses we incur may exceed our cost estimates and estimated product development schedules may be extended. Furthermore, any new products we develop may not generate sales sufficient to offset our costs. If any of these events occur, our sales and profits could be materially adversely affected. 

We may incur losses and liabilities as a result of our acquisition strategy. Part of our business strategy involves developing technologies and capabilities through acquisitions. Growth by acquisition involves risks that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, including: 

&#8226; the potential exposure to unanticipated liabilities; 

&#8226; the potential that expected benefits or synergies are not realized and that operating costs increase; 

&#8226; the risks associated with incurring additional acquisition indebtedness, including that additional indebtedness could limit our cash flow availability for operations and our flexibility; 

&#8226; difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies; 

&#8226; the potential loss of key employees, suppliers or customers of acquired businesses; and 

&#8226; diversion of management time and attention from our core business. 

In addition, any acquisition, once successfully integrated, could negatively impact our financial performance if it does not perform as planned, does not increase earnings, or does not prove otherwise to be beneficial to us. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to complete any acquisitions and then successfully integrate the business and operations of those acquisitions without encountering the risks described above. If we are not able to efficiently integrate an acquisition&#8217;s business and operations into our organization in a timely and efficient manner, or at all, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized, or it may take longer to realize these benefits than we currently expect, either of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Operational Risks 

Our business and operations could be adversely impacted in the event of a failure of our information technology infrastructure or adversely impacted by a successful cyber-attack. We are dependent on various information technologies throughout our Company to administer, store and support multiple business activities. We routinely experience various cybersecurity threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure, unauthorized attempts to gain access to our sensitive information, and denial-of-service attacks, and our customers, suppliers and subcontractors face similar cybersecurity threats. We conduct regular periodic training of our employees as to the protection of sensitive information, which includes security awareness training intended to prevent the success of &#8220;phishing&#8221; attacks. 

The threats we face vary from attacks common to most industries, such as ransomware attacks to disable critical infrastructure and extort companies for ransom payments, to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries, including nation states, which target us and other defense contractors because we protect sensitive information. If we are unable to protect sensitive information, our customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures, and depending on the severity of the incident, our customers&#8217; data, our employees&#8217; data, our intellectual property, and other third-party data (such as subcontractors, suppliers and vendors) could be compromised. As a consequence of the persistence, sophistication and volume of these bad actors, we may not be successful in defending against all such attacks. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, the impact of any future cybersecurity incident cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty. 

Although we work cooperatively with our customers, suppliers, and subcontractors to seek to minimize the impact of cybersecurity threats, other security threats or business disruptions, we must rely on the safeguards put in place by these entities, which may affect the security of our information. These entities have varying levels of cybersecurity expertise and safeguards and their relationships with U.S. government contractors, such as Astronics, may increase the likelihood that they are targeted by the same cybersecurity threats we face. Furthermore, our customers, suppliers and subcontractors may incorporate AI tools without disclosing this use to us, and the providers of these AI tools may not meet existing or rapidly evolving regulatory or industry standards with respect to privacy and data protection and may inhibit our or their ability to maintain an adequate level of service and experience. If we or our customers, suppliers or subcontractors experience an actual or perceived breach or privacy or security incident because of the use of AI, we may lose valuable confidential information and our reputation and the public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed. 

If we experience a data security breach from an external source or from an insider threat, we may have a loss in sales or increased costs arising from the restoration or implementation of additional security measures, either of which could adversely affect our business and financial results. Other potential costs could include damage to our reputation, loss of brand value, incident response costs, decrease in the price of our common stock, regulatory inquiries, litigation and management distraction from operating our business. A security breach that involves classified information could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, loss of a government contract, loss of access to classified information, or debarment as a government contractor. Similarly, a breach that involves loss of customer-provided data could subject us to loss of a customer, loss of a contract, litigation costs and legal damages and reputational harm. One or more of these results could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Our inability to adequately enforce and protect our intellectual property or defend against assertions of infringement could prevent or restrict our ability to compete. We rely on patents, trademarks and proprietary knowledge and technology, both internally developed and acquired, in order to maintain a competitive advantage. Our inability to defend against the unauthorized use of these intellectual property rights and assets could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We cannot assure you that our means of protecting our intellectual property rights in the United States or abroad will be adequate, or that others will not develop technologies similar or superior to our technology or design around our proprietary rights. Litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against claims of infringement. This litigation could result in significant costs and divert our management&#8217;s focus away from our core business operations. Refer to the risk factor below under the heading &#8220; Currently, our subsidiary, Astronics Advanced Electronic Systems Corp., is a defendant in actions filed in various jurisdictions by Lufthansa Technik AG relating to an allegation of patent infringement and based on rulings to date, we have concluded that losses related to these proceedings are probable &#8221; and Note 19, Legal Proceedings, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this report for further discussion. 

If critical components or raw materials used to manufacture our products or used in our development programs become scarce or unavailable, then we may incur delays in manufacturing and delivery of our products and in completing our development programs, which has damaged, and could continue to damage, our business, results of operations and financial condition. Due to increased demand across a range of industries, the global supply chain for certain critical components and raw materials used in the manufacture of our products and used in our development programs has in the past experienced, and may in future periods experience, significant strain. A constrained supply environment has in the past adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, availability, lead times and the cost of components, and could impact our ability to timely complete development programs, respond to accelerated or quick-turn delivery requests from customers, or meet customer demand and product delivery dates for our end customers in situations where we cannot timely secure adequate supply of these components. Moreover, if any of our suppliers become financially unstable, or otherwise unable or unwilling to provide us with raw materials or components, then we may have to find new suppliers. It may take several months to locate alternative suppliers, if required, or to redesign our products to accommodate components from different suppliers. We may experience significant delays in manufacturing and shipping our products to customers and incur additional development, manufacturing and other costs to establish alternative sources of supply if we lose any of these sources or are required to redesign our products. We cannot predict if we will be able to obtain replacement components within the time frames that we require at an acceptable cost, if at all. 

In an effort to mitigate these risks, in some cases, we have incurred higher costs to secure available inventory or have extended or placed non-cancellable purchase commitments with suppliers, which introduces inventory risk if our forecasts and assumptions prove inaccurate. While we may attempt to recover the increased costs through price increases to our customers, we may be unable to mitigate the effect on our results of operations. We have also multi-sourced and pre-ordered components and raw materials inventory in some cases in an effort to reduce the impact of the adverse supply chain conditions we have experienced or may experience in the future. Limits on manufacturing availability or capacity or delays in production or delivery of components or raw materials could delay or inhibit our ability to obtain supply of components and produce finished goods. Supply chain constraints and their related challenges could result in shortages, increased material costs or use of cash, engineering design changes, and delays in new product introductions, each of which could materially adversely affect our growth, gross margin and financial results. These types of negative financial impacts on our business may become more acute if supply chain pressures increase. 

Our financial results could continue to be adversely impacted by the escalation of labor and benefit costs. Consistent with the experience of other employers, our labor, medical and workers&#8217; compensation costs have increased substantially in recent years and are expected to continue to rise. If this trend continues, the cost of labor and to provide healthcare and other benefits to our employees could continue to increase, which could materially adversely affect our future profitability. Competition for employees has escalated in the labor market which has increased costs associated with attracting and retaining skilled employees. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequately skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently or that our labor costs will not increase as a result of a shortage in the availability of skilled employees. Any significant increases in the costs attributable to our self-insured health and workers&#8217; compensation plans could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

Price inflation for labor and materials, further exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine or the Israel-Hamas war, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have experienced considerable price inflation in our costs for labor and materials in recent years, which has materially adversely affected our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may not be able to pass through to our customers inflationary cost increases under our existing fixed-price contracts. Our ability to raise prices to reflect increased costs may be limited by competitive conditions in the market for our products and services. Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, and prolonged conflict in either such situation, may continue to result in increased inflation, escalating energy and commodity prices and increasing costs of materials. We continue to work to mitigate such pressures on our business operations as they develop. To the extent the war in Ukraine or the Israel-Hamas war adversely affects our business as discussed above, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein, such as those relating to cybersecurity, supply chain, volatility in prices and market conditions, any of which could negatively affect our business and financial condition. 

If our subcontractors fail to perform their contractual obligations, our prime contract performance and our ability to obtain future business could be materially adversely affected. Many of our contracts involve subcontracts with other companies upon whom we rely to perform a portion of the services we must provide to our customers. There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor or customer concerns about the subcontractor. Failure by our subcontractors to satisfactorily provide, on a timely basis, the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services may materially adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations to our customer and could result in the assessment of late delivery penalties. Subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in a customer terminating our contract for cause or could otherwise result in our default under the applicable 

contract. A termination for cause or other default could expose us to liability, damage our reputation and substantially impair our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. 

Some of our contracts contain late delivery penalties. Our failure to deliver our products in a timely manner, whether due to supplier and supply chain problems, labor availability, development schedule slides, manufacturing difficulties, similar schedule-related events or otherwise, may trigger late delivery penalties pursuant to certain of our contracts, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. While no significant penalties have been incurred to date, the risk factors described herein may cause future deliveries to be delayed and may cause us to incur such significant penalties in the future. 

Our results of operations are affected by our fixed-price contracts, which could subject us to losses in the event that we have cost overruns. For the year ended December 31, 2024, fixed-price contracts represented almost all of the Company&#8217;s sales. On fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the scope of work specified in the contract for a predetermined price. Depending on the fixed price negotiated, these contracts may provide us with an opportunity to achieve higher profits based on the relationship between our costs and the contract&#8217;s fixed price. However, we bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs, such as contractual delays, failure of subcontractor performance, litigation with contract counterparties, inaccurate cost estimates or otherwise, may reduce our profit or cause us to incur a loss on the contract, which could reduce our net earnings. Because our ability to terminate contracts is generally limited, we may not be able to terminate our performance requirements under these contracts at all or without substantial liability and, therefore, in the event we are sustaining reduced profits or losses, we could continue to sustain these reduced profits or losses for the duration of the contract term. Our failure to anticipate technical problems, estimate delivery reductions, estimate costs accurately or control costs during performance of a fixed-price contract may reduce our profitability or cause significant losses on programs. 

The failure of our products may damage our reputation, necessitate a product recall or result in claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage, thereby requiring us to pay significant damages. Defects in the design and manufacture of our products may necessitate a product recall. We include complex system design and components in our products that could contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products. If any of our products are defective, we could be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims. Such an event could result in significant expenses, disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products. We are also exposed to product liability claims. We carry aircraft and non-aircraft product liability insurance consistent with the commercial standards in our industry. However, this insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover the payment of any potential claim. Additionally, should insurance market conditions change, aircraft and non-aircraft product liability insurance coverage may not be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us. A product recall or a product liability claim not covered by insurance could materially adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. 

Our operations depend on our manufacturing facilities, which are subject to physical and other risks that could disrupt production. Our manufacturing facilities or our customers&#8217; facilities could be damaged or disrupted by a natural disaster, war, or terrorist activity. We maintain property damage and business interruption insurance consistent with the commercial standards in our industry or for our customers and suppliers, however, a pandemic or other major catastrophe, such as an earthquake, hurricane, fire, flood, tornado or other natural disaster at any of our sites, or political instability resulting from war, insurrections, terrorist activities, foreign civil unrest or other unforeseen circumstances in any of the areas where we conduct operations could result in a prolonged interruption of our business. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in shipments of products and the loss of sales and customers, and we may not have insurance to adequately compensate us for any of these events. For leased facilities, timely renewal of leases and risk mitigation from the sale of our leased facilities is required to avoid any business interruption. 

We may be subject to work stoppages at our facilities or those of our principal customers and suppliers, which could seriously impact the profitability of our business. Many aircraft manufacturers, airlines, and aerospace suppliers have unionized work forces. Any strikes, work stoppages, or slowdowns experienced by aircraft manufacturers, airlines, or aerospace suppliers could reduce our customers&#8217; demand for additional aircraft structures or prevent us from completing production of our products. 

A small percentage of our workforce is represented by unions. If we were unable to renew our labor agreements at expiration, or if our workers were to engage in a strike, work stoppage, or other slowdown, we could experience a disruption of our operations, which could cause us to be unable to deliver products to certain of our customers on a timely basis and could result in a breach of such supply agreements. This could negatively impact our results. In addition, our non-unionized labor force may become subject to labor union organizing efforts, which could cause us to incur additional labor costs and increase the related risks that we now face. 

The construction of aircraft is heavily regulated, and failure to comply with applicable laws could reduce our sales or require us to incur additional costs to achieve compliance, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with new or more stringent governmental regulation. The aerospace industry is highly regulated in the United States by the FAA and in other countries by similar agencies. We must be certified by the FAA and, in some cases, by individual OEMs in order to engineer and service parts, components and aerostructures used in specific aircraft models. If any of our material authorizations or approvals were revoked or suspended, our operations would be adversely affected. New or more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted, or industry oversight heightened in the future, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or any heightened industry oversight. In addition, in January 2024, the FAA ordered the temporary grounding of Boeing 737-9 MAX aircraft as a result of an incident where a Boeing 737-9 MAX lost a &#8220;door plug.&#8221; This incident and the subsequent investigation, and the potential for more issues to be identified during further investigations, could result in a suspension or reduction of manufacturing of 737 MAX aircraft by Boeing. Air travelers may also respond negatively to the 737 MAX aircraft due to perceived safety concerns, which could negatively impact Boeing. Boeing is a major customer of ours and any financial or customer losses it suffers may result in a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

In addition, recent U.S. government administrations have relied on executive orders in lieu of federal legislation to implement regulatory policy and objectives, and the U.S. Supreme Court has recently issued decisions that have added uncertainty to the federal regulatory apparatus. Each of these developments could exacerbate regulatory unpredictability. We may be unable to anticipate changes in regulatory regimes of the U.S. federal government administration and, therefore, be unable to make timely operational or other changes, assuming we are in a position to effectively respond to any such change, which may not be the case, or to ensure compliance with federal regulations or executive orders. Executive orders or regulatory priorities issued or rescinded by the U.S. federal government administration may require us to make additional capital expenditures or incur additional costs, or cause a delay or the abandonment of projects or awarded contracts, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition In addition, increased regulatory uncertainty following the forementioned U.S. Supreme Court decisions could result in delays and other impediments to the federal agency rulemaking process, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition 

Financial Risks 

We have incurred losses in prior fiscal years and our future profitability is not certain. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we incurred a net loss of $16.2 million, $26.4 million and $35.7 million, respectively. Our operating results for future periods are subject to numerous uncertainties and we cannot be certain that we will be profitable or that we will not experience substantial net losses in the future. If we are not able to increase revenue or reduce our costs, we may not be able to achieve profitability in future periods and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected. 

Our ABL Revolving Credit Facility contains financial and restrictive covenants that we may be unable to satisfy, and that, if not satisfied, could result in the acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness thereunder and limit our ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the terms of our ABL Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants that restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to take certain actions. Our ABL Revolving Credit Facility subjects us to various financial and other affirmative and negative covenants with which we must comply on an ongoing or periodic basis. These include financial covenants pertaining to minimum excess availability and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio requirements. An unexpected decline in our revenues or operating income, including occurring as a result of events beyond our control, could cause us to violate our financial covenants. A covenant violation could result in a default under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility. If any such default occurs, the lenders may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. Further, as the amount available to us under our ABL Revolving Credit Facility is subject to borrowing base calculations determined by the value of accounts receivable, inventory, real estate and machinery and equipment, an unexpected decline in the value of these assets would require a mandatory prepayment. If any of these events were to occur, we may not be able to pay our debts and other monetary obligations as they come due, and our ability to continue to operate as a going concern could be impaired, which could in turn cause a significant decline in our common stock price and could result in a significant loss of value for our shareholders. Furthermore, the lenders also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings, which could leave us without access to sufficient liquidity to operate our business. In addition, following an event of default, the lenders under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt, which includes our available accounts receivable, inventory, machinery and equipment, real estate and intellectual property. If the debt under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility were to be accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full our debt. 

Additionally, our ABL Revolving Credit Facility contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on the Company and our subsidiaries and may limit our ability to engage in acts that we believe to be 

in our long-term best interests. The ABL Revolving Credit Facility include covenants restricting, among other things, the ability of the Company and our subsidiaries to: 

&#8226; incur additional indebtedness; 

&#8226; pay dividends on or repurchase our capital stock; 

&#8226; make certain acquisitions or investments; 

&#8226; sell assets; and 

&#8226; engage in certain business activities. 

Our inability to raise funds necessary to repurchase, or settle conversions of, our Convertible Notes upon a fundamental change as described in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes, may lead to defaults under such indenture and under agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness. On December 3, 2024, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $165 million 5.500% Convertible Notes due March 15, 2030, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The interest rate is fixed at 5.500% per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2025. 

If a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes) occurs, then, subject to limited exceptions, holders of our Convertible Notes may require the Company to repurchase all or any their Convertible Notes for cash. If we repurchase the Convertible Notes for cash or settle such Convertible Notes by cash or by a combination of cash and shares of our common stock in the event a holder of our Convertible Notes elects to convert their Convertible Notes following a fundamental change, we will be required to make cash payments with respect to the Convertible Notes being converted or repurchased. 

However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make purchases of the Convertible Notes being surrendered or converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Convertible Notes or to pay cash upon conversion of Convertible Notes is limited by the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and may also be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements that will govern our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase Convertible Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture governing the Convertible Notes or to pay cash payable on future conversions of the Convertible Notes as required by such indenture would constitute a default under such indenture. A default under the indenture governing the Convertible Notes or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility. 

The conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Under certain circumstances, holders of our Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert such Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders of our Convertible Notes elect to convert their Convertible Notes, we may initially elect to satisfy our conversion obligations by combination settlement. In addition, in the future, we may elect to settle all of our conversion obligations through the payment of cash, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Convertible Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Convertible Notes as a current liability, rather than a long-term liability, which could result in a material reduction of our net working capital. 

Conversion of the Convertible Notes will dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock. The conversion of some or all of the Convertible Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders to the extent we deliver shares of our common stock upon conversion of any of the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes may from time to time in the future be convertible at the option of their holders prior to their scheduled terms under certain circumstances. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Convertible Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Convertible Notes could be used to satisfy short positions or anticipated conversion of the Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock. 

The amount of debt we have outstanding, as well as any debt we may incur in the future, could have an adverse effect on our operational and financial flexibility. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $175.0 million of debt outstanding. Changes to our level of debt subsequent to December 31, 2024, could have significant consequences to our business, including the following: 

&#8226; Depending on interest rates and debt maturities, a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations could be dedicated to paying principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing funds available for our acquisition strategy, capital expenditures or other purposes; 

&#8226; A significant amount of additional debt could make us more vulnerable to changes in economic conditions or increases in prevailing interest rates; 

&#8226; Our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions, capital expenditures or for other purposes could be impaired; 

&#8226; The increase in the amount of debt we have outstanding and the associated interest expense increases the risk of non-compliance with some of the covenants in our debt agreements which require us to maintain specified financial ratios; and 

&#8226; We may be more leveraged than some of our competitors, which may result in a competitive disadvantage. 

Subject to the limits contained in our ABL Revolving Credit Facility, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks described above related to our debt could intensify. 

A write-off of all or part of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our operating results and net worth. As of December 31, 2024, goodwill and net intangible assets were approximately 8.9% and 8.1% of our total assets, respectively. We had no goodwill impairment charges during 2024, 2023 or 2022. Our goodwill and other intangible assets may increase in the future since our strategy includes growing through acquisitions. We may have to write-off all or part of our goodwill or purchased intangible assets if their value becomes impaired. Although such a write-off may not result in an outlay of cash and is not included in the financial covenant calculation, it could reduce our earnings and net worth significantly. 

Our future operating results could be impacted by estimates used to calculate impairment losses on goodwill and long-lived assets. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant and subjective estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of tangible and intangible long-lived assets, including goodwill, in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are integral in the determination of whether a potential non-cash impairment loss exists as well as the calculation of that loss. Actual future results could differ materially from those estimates. We had no such asset impairment charges in 2024, 2023 or 2022. 

Changes in discount rates and other estimates could affect our future earnings and equity. Our goodwill asset impairment evaluations are determined using valuations that involve several assumptions, including discount rates, cash flow estimates, growth rates and terminal values. Certain of these assumptions, particularly the discount rate, are based on market conditions and are outside of our control. Changes in these assumptions could affect our future earnings and equity. 

Additionally, pension obligations and the related costs are determined using actual results and actuarial valuations that involve several assumptions. The most critical assumption is the discount rate. Other assumptions include mortality, salary and bonus levels and retirement age. The discount rate assumptions are based on current market conditions and are outside of our control. Changes in these assumptions could affect our future earnings and equity. 

Changes in tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial results. Changes in U.S. (federal or state) or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including those with retroactive effect, could result in increases in our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flows. For example, beginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures immediately in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures over five years for tax purposes. The most significant impact of this provision is to the cash tax liability for 2024 and 2023 (as the liability for 2022 is partially offset by certain tax credits and loss carryforwards); the impact will decline annually thereafter over the five-year amortization period to an immaterial amount in year six. Furthermore, compliance with the tax regimes we are subject to is difficult and expensive. If we fail to adhere, or are alleged to have failed to adhere, to any applicable federal, state, or foreign laws or regulations, or if such laws or regulations negatively affect sales of our products, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, our future results could be materially adversely affected by changes in applicable federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations, or the interpretation or enforcement thereof (including tax-rate changes, new tax laws such as the proposed 15% global minimum tax under the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Pillar Two, Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules, or revised tax law interpretations). 

We are subject to financing and interest rate exposure risks that could adversely affect our business, liquidity and operating results. Changes in the availability, terms and cost of capital, and increases in interest rates could cause our cost of doing business to increase and place us at a competitive disadvantage. At December 31, 2024, the $10.0 million outstanding on our ABL Revolving Credit Facility is subject to variable interest rates. 

Legal and Compliance Risks 

We currently are involved in, and may become involved in the future in, legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could materially and adversely impact our financial condition. As an aerospace company, we may become a party to litigation, including, among others, matters alleging product liability, warranty claims, intellectual property infringement, breach of commercial or government contract or other legal actions. In general, litigation claims can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. For example, in some instances, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary information, or to defend against claims by third parties that our products infringe upon their intellectual property rights. Any litigation or claims brought by or against us, whether with or without merit, could result in substantial costs to us and divert the attention of our management, which could materially harm our business and results of operations. In addition, any intellectual property litigation or claims against us could result in the loss or compromise of our intellectual property and proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities, require us to seek licenses on unfavorable terms, expose us to injunctive relief, prevent us from manufacturing or selling certain products or require us to redesign certain products, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 

Currently, our subsidiary, Astronics Advanced Electronic Systems Corp., is a defendant in actions filed in various jurisdictions by Lufthansa Technik AG relating to an allegation of patent infringement and based on rulings to date, we have concluded that losses related to these proceedings are probable and the amounts of such losses could be substantial. Lufthansa Technik AG (&#8220;Lufthansa&#8221;) filed actions against us in Germany, the UK and France. In both Germany and the UK, the Company has been found to infringe the patents of Lufthansa and will be subject to monetary damages and estimates of which have been accrued as liabilities in our financial statements. However, the actual amount of damages that may be addressed in the future could be substantially higher than the amounts that have been accrued as liabilities in our financial statements. In February 2025, a judgment quantified the amount payable in aggregate in respect of the profits derived from infringing Lufthansa&#8217;s UK patent by the defendants as $11.9 million. Any additional amounts required to be paid by the Company related to certain other factors peripheral to the damages award, including reimbursement of legal fees related to the damages proceedings, will be determined at follow-up hearings expected to occur in the first half of 2025. An appeal, if any, would likely be heard in early 2026. 

Refer to Note 19, Legal Proceedings, of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this report for discussion on this and other legal proceedings. 

Our operations in foreign countries expose us to political and currency risks and adverse changes in local legal and regulatory environments. In 2024, approximately 10% of our sales were made by our subsidiaries in foreign countries, predominately in our subsidiaries in France and Canada. Net assets held by our foreign subsidiaries total $41.3 million as of December 31, 2024. Approximately 25% of our consolidated sales in 2024 were made to customers outside of the United States. Our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currencies and by the translation of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from local currencies into U.S. dollars. We expect international operations and export sales to continue to contribute to our earnings for the foreseeable future. Both the sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside of the U.S. Such risks include the possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations, changes in tariff and trade barriers and import or export licensing requirements, and political or economic reprioritization, insurrection, civil disturbance or war. 

Government regulations could limit our ability to sell our products outside the U.S. and could otherwise adversely affect our business. Certain of our sales are subject to compliance with U.S. export regulations. Our failure to comply with the regulatory limitations, licensing requirements, registration standards or other requirements under applicable U.S. export regulations would hinder our ability to generate sales of our products outside the U.S. Compliance with these export regulations may also subject us to additional fees and operating costs. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position. In order to sell our products in European Union countries, we must satisfy certain technical requirements. If we are unable to comply with those requirements with respect to a significant quantity of our products, our sales in Europe could be restricted. Doing business internationally also subjects us to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, foreign corrupt practices and anti-boycott provisions. Our failure, or failure by an authorized agent or representative that is attributable to us, to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in monetary penalties, suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Trade policies, treaties, and tariffs could materially adversely affect our business. Our business is dependent on the availability of raw materials and components for our products, particularly electrical components common in the semiconductor industry. There is continued uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and various other countries, 

most significantly China, with respect to trade policies, treaties, tariffs, and taxes. Changes in U.S. administrative policy could lead to changes in existing trade agreements, greater restrictions on free trade generally, and significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the United States, particularly tariffs on products manufactured in Canada, China and Mexico, among other possible changes. For example, in February 2025, the new U.S. presidential administration announced tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China, and then subsequently paused the tariffs on Canada and Mexico. It is uncertain whether the tariffs on Canada and Mexico will be reinstated. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, could materially adversely affect global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and could significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between the impacted nations and the United States. 

This uncertainty includes: (i) the possibility of altering the existing tariffs or penalties on products manufactured outside the United States, including the U.S. government&#8217;s 25% tariff on a range of products from China; (ii) the effects stemming from the removal of such previously imposed tariffs; (iii) subsequent tariffs imposed by the United States on any other countries; and (iv) potential tariffs imposed by trading partners on U.S. exports. The institution of trade tariffs on items imported by us from other countries could increase our costs, which could have a negative impact on our business. 

We cannot predict whether, and to what extent, there may be changes to international trade agreements or whether quotas, duties, tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions on our products will be changed or imposed. In addition, an open conflict or war across any region could affect our ability to obtain raw materials. For example, the current military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and related sanctions, export controls or other actions that may be initiated by nations, including the United States, the European Union or Russia (e.g., potential cyberattacks, disruption of energy flows, etc.) or potential sanctions or relevant export controls related to China or Taiwan could adversely affect our business and/or our supply chain or our business partners or customers in other countries beyond Russia and Ukraine. Although we currently maintain alternative sources for raw materials, i f we are unable to source our products from the countries where we wish to purchase them, either because of the occurrence or threat of wars or other conflicts, regulatory changes or for any other reason, or if the cost of doing so increases, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Disruptions in the supply of raw materials and components could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture our products for our customers or require us to pay higher prices to obtain these raw materials or components from other sources, which could materially adversely affect our business and our results of operations. 

We may face reputational, regulatory or financial risks from a perceived, or an actual, failure to achieve our sustainability goals. The increased focus on sustainability practices and disclosures is rapidly evolving, as is the criteria to measure our sustainability performance; both of which could result in greater expectations and may cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy the evolving criteria. As we advance our sustainable business model, we are pursuing programs that we believe will improve our environmental practices, social engagement and how we govern ourselves. We periodically publish information about our sustainability goals, standards and frameworks. Achievement of these objectives is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our direct control, and it is possible we may fail, or be perceived to have failed, in the achievement of our sustainability goals. Also, certain customers, associates, shareholders, investors, suppliers, business partners, government agencies and non-governmental organizations may not be satisfied with our sustainability efforts. A failure or perceived failure of our sustainability goals could negatively affect our reputation and our results of operations. 

We are subject to extensive regulation and audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. The accuracy and appropriateness of certain costs and expenses used to substantiate our direct and indirect costs for the U.S. Government contracts are subject to extensive regulation and audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency, an arm of the U.S. Department of Defense (&#8220;USDOD&#8221;). Such audits and reviews could result in adjustments to our contract costs and profitability. However, we cannot ensure the outcome of any future audits and adjustments may be required to reduce net sales or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits. If any audit or review were to uncover inaccurate costs or improper activities, we could be subject to penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from conducting future business with the U.S. Government. Any such outcome could materially adversely affect our financial results. 

We are subject to the requirements of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual for facility security clearance, which is a prerequisite for our ability to perform on classified contracts for the U.S. Government. USDOD facility security clearance is required in order to be awarded and be able to perform on classified contracts for the USDOD and certain other agencies of the U.S. Government, which is a significant part of our business. We have obtained clearance at appropriate levels that require stringent qualifications, and we may be required to seek higher level clearances in the future. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our security clearance. If for some reason our security clearance is invalidated or terminated, we may not be able to continue to perform our present classified contracts or be able to enter into new classified contracts, which could affect our ability to compete for and capture new business. 

Our business is subject to regulation in the United States and internationally. The manufacturing of our products is subject to numerous federal, state and foreign governmental regulations. The number of laws and regulations that are being enacted or proposed by various governmental bodies and authorities is increasing. Compliance with these regulations is difficult and expensive. If we fail to adhere, or are alleged to have failed to adhere, to any applicable federal, state, or foreign laws or regulations, or if such laws or regulations negatively affect sales of our products, our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows may be adversely affected. In addition, our future results could be adversely affected by changes in applicable federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations, or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, including those relating to manufacturing processes, product liability, government contracts, trade rules and customs regulations, intellectual property, consumer laws, privacy laws, environmental protection, climate change, as well as accounting standards and taxation requirements (including tax-rate changes, new tax laws or revised tax law interpretations). 

General Risks 

Our future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management team and technical personnel. Our ability to hire new talent, develop existing talent and to retain our management team and other key personnel is critical to our success. The loss of members of our management team could materially adversely affect our business. In addition, competition for qualified technical personnel in our industry is intense, and we believe that our future growth and success will depend on our ability to attract, train and retain such qualified personnel. If we are unable to retain our management team, maintain and develop our key personnel and attract new qualified employees, the execution of our business strategy may be hindered and our growth limited. 

If we fail to meet expectations of securities analysts or investors due to fluctuations in our sales or operating results, our stock price could decline significantly. Our sales and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, including delays or cancellations of programs and supply chain challenges on revenues and costs. It is likely that in some future quarters our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. In this event, the trading price of our stock could decline significantly. 

Our stock price is volatile. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our stock price ranged from a low of $15.59 to a high of $23.39. The price of our common stock has been and likely will continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of events and factors, such as: 

&#8226; our ability to comply with the financial and other affirmative and negative covenants included in our ABL Revolving Credit Facility; 

&#8226; quarterly variations in operating results; 

&#8226; variances of our quarterly results of operations from securities analyst estimates; 

&#8226; changes in financial estimates; 

&#8226; announcements of technological innovations and new products; 

&#8226; news reports relating to trends in our markets or adverse happenings at our customers; and 

&#8226; the cancellation of major contracts or programs with our customers; 

In addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for companies in the aerospace and defense industry in particular, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the companies affected by these fluctuations. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Global health crises, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, with the breadth of its impact worldwide, and particularly on the aerospace industry, could also cause significant volatility in the market price.

Our business is subject to numerous risks. The following important factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;), press releases, communications with investors, and oral statements. Actual future results may differ materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. 

Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital 

We have incurred significant losses since inception. We expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability. 

Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $237.1 million, $153.2 million, and $220.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.47 billion. We have financed our operations primarily through public offerings of our common stock, our research collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb Company (&#8220;BMS&#8221;) through its wholly owned subsidiary, Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (&#8220;Juno Therapeutics&#8221;) , payments under our former strategic alliance with Allergan Pharmaceuticals International Limited (together with its affiliates, &#8220;Allergan&#8221;), payments received under our purchase and sale agreement with DRI Healthcare Acquisitions LP, and payments under our license agreement with Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#8220;Vertex&#8221;). We have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we: 

&#8226; progress the preclinical development of our in vivo programs and seek to achieve our stated strategic priorities through 2027; 

&#8226; continue our current research programs and our preclinical and clinical development of product candidates from our current research programs; 

&#8226; seek to identify additional research programs and additional product candidates; 

&#8226; initiate preclinical testing and clinical trials for any product candidates we identify and develop; 

&#8226; maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio and provide reimbursement of third-party expenses related to our patent portfolio; 

&#8226; seek marketing approvals for any of our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; 

&#8226; establish a sales, marketing, and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any medicines for which we may obtain marketing approval; 

&#8226; further develop our genome editing platform; 

&#8226; hire additional clinical, quality control, and scientific personnel; 

&#8226; add operational, financial, and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development; 

&#8226; acquire or in-license other medicines and technologies; and 

&#8226; establish, expand or contract for commercial-scale current Good Manufacturing Practices (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;) manufacturing capabilities. 

In December 2024, we announced the discontinuation of the clinical development of our ex vivo renizgamglogene autogedtemcel (&#8220;reni-cel&#8221;) program to treat sickle cell disease (&#8220;SCD&#8221;) and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (&#8220;TDT&#8221;) and a related employee workforce reduction. We expect to incur substantial costs as we complete the wind-down of various activities related to clinical development of reni-cel, including contract termination costs, impairment charges and non-cash charges, and may also incur additional costs not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of or that are associated with the discontinuation. We additionally expect to incur substantial costs related to the employee workforce reduction, primarily consisting of severance payments and employee benefit costs. The charges related to these activities are expected to be substantially incurred through the end of June 2025. The amounts and timing of these charges may be impacted by events that may occur as a result of, or that are associated with, these activities, which impacts could be material. We may not experience the expected benefits of the employee workforce reduction or the decision to discontinue clinical development of reni-cel. 

We expect that it will be many years, if ever, before we have a product candidate ready for commercialization. To become and remain profitable, we must develop and eventually commercialize a medicine or medicines with significant market potential. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including identifying product candidates, completing preclinical testing and clinical trials of product candidates, obtaining marketing approval for these product candidates, manufacturing, marketing, and selling those medicines for which we may obtain marketing approval, and satisfying any post-marketing requirements. We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may never generate revenues that are significant or large enough to achieve profitability. We are currently only in the preclinical testing stages for our most advanced research programs. If we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, maintain our research and development efforts, expand our business, or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could cause our stockholders to lose all or part of their investments in us. 

We will need substantial additional funding. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we would be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate our research and product development programs or commercialization efforts. 

We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we identify, continue the research and development of, initiate preclinical studies and clinical trials of, and seek marketing approval for, product candidates. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any product candidates we develop, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution to the extent that such sales, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution are not the responsibility of a collaborator. We may also need to raise additional funds sooner if we choose to pursue additional indications or geographies for our product candidates or otherwise expand more rapidly than we presently anticipate. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, 

we would be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate our research and product development programs or future commercialization efforts. 

We expect that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on December 31, 2024, together with the retained portions of the payments payable under our license agreement with Vertex, will fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter of 2027. As of December 31, 2024 , our right to contingent payments under our collaboration agreements with BMS and our license agreement with Vor Bio, as well as the retained portions of the contingent upfront payment and other amounts under our license agreement with Vertex, are our only significant committed potential external source of funds. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 

&#8226; the restructuring costs associated with the discontinuation of clinical development of reni-cel; 

&#8226; the scope, progress, results, and costs of drug discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing, and clinical or natural history study trials for the product candidates we may develop; 

&#8226; the costs of preparing, filing, and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property and proprietary rights, and defending intellectual property-related claims; 

&#8226; the costs, timing, and outcome of regulatory review of the product candidates we may develop; 

&#8226; the costs of establishing and maintaining a supply chain for the development and manufacture of our product candidates; 

&#8226; the costs of future activities, including product sales, medical affairs, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution, for any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval; 

&#8226; the success of our collaboration with BMS, including whether BMS exercises any of its options to extend the research program term and/or to additional research programs under our collaboration; 

&#8226; our ability to establish and maintain additional collaborations on favorable terms, if at all; 

&#8226; the extent to which we acquire or in-license other medicines and technologies; 

&#8226; the costs of reimbursing our licensors for the prosecution and maintenance of the patent rights in-licensed by us; and 

&#8226; our ability to establish and maintain healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement for any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval. 

Identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive, and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data or results required to obtain marketing approval and achieve product sales. In addition, even if we successfully identify and develop product candidates and those are approved, we will require significant additional amounts in order to launch and commercialize our product candidates and may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of medicines that we do not expect to be commercially available for years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. 

Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates. 

Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and licensing arrangements. We have limited significant committed potential external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our stockholders may be materially diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt financing, if available, would result in increased fixed payment obligations and 

may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. 

If we raise funds through additional collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs, or product candidates, or we may have to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. 

Our limited operating history may make it difficult for our stockholders to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability. 

We have never successfully completed a clinical trial. Following our discontinuation of the clinical development of reni-cel, we have become an early-stage company. We were founded and commenced operations in the second half of 2013. Our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, acquiring and developing our technology, identifying potential product candidates, undertaking preclinical studies and initiating and conducting clinical trials. All of our ongoing research programs are in the preclinical or research stage of development, and the risk of failure of all of our research programs is high. We have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully complete any clinical trials, including large-scale, pivotal clinical trials, obtain marketing approvals, manufacture a commercial-scale medicine, or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful commercialization. In addition, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other known and unknown factors. 

Our limited operating history, particularly in light of the rapidly evolving genome editing field, may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future performance. Our relatively short history as an operating company makes any assessment of our future success or viability subject to significant uncertainty. We will encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by other early-stage companies in rapidly evolving fields. If we do not address these risks successfully, our business will suffer. 

We expect that our financial condition and operating results will continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, our stockholders should not rely upon the results of any quarterly or annual periods as indications of future operating performance. 

We have never generated revenue from product sales and may never be profitable. 

Our ability to generate revenue from product sales and achieve profitability depends on our ability, alone or with collaboration partners, to successfully complete the development of, and obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize, product candidates we may identify for development. We do not anticipate generating revenues from product sales for years, if ever. 

Even if one or more of the product candidates we develop is approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved product candidate. Our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the &#8220;FDA&#8221;), the European Medicines Agency (the &#8220;EMA&#8221;), or other regulatory authorities to perform clinical and other studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate. Even if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of any approved products, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations. 

Risks Related to Discovery, Development, and Commercialization 

We intend to identify and develop product candidates based on a relatively novel genome editing technology, which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of product candidate development. Only one therapeutic product that utilizes genome editing technology has been approved in the United States or in Europe. 

We have concentrated our research and development efforts on our genome editing platform, which uses CRISPR technology. Our future success depends on the successful development of this relatively novel genome editing therapeutic approach. In 2023, the first and, to date, only, approved therapeutic product that utilizes ex vivo CRISPR-based genome editing was approved in the United States and Europe. To date, in the United States, the FDA has not approved any in vivo CRISPR-based genome editing therapeutic. It is difficult for us to predict the time and cost of product candidate development, and we cannot predict whether the application of our genome editing platform, or any similar or competitive 

genome editing platforms, will result in the identification, development, and regulatory approval of any medicines. There can be no assurance that any development problems we experience in the future related to our genome editing platform or any of our research programs will not cause significant delays or unanticipated costs, or that such development problems can be solved. We may also experience delays in developing a sustainable, reproducible, and scalable manufacturing process or transferring that process to commercial partners. Any of these factors may prevent us from completing our preclinical studies or any clinical trials that we may initiate or commercializing any product candidates we develop on a timely or profitable basis, if at all. 

Regulatory requirements governing genetic medicines, and in particular any novel genetic medicines we may develop, have changed frequently and may continue to change in the future. 

Regulatory requirements governing genetic and cellular medicines, and in particular any novel genetic medicine products we may develop, have changed frequently and may continue to change in the future. We are aware of a limited number of genetic medicines that have received marketing authorization from the FDA and EMA. Even with respect to more established products in the genetic medicine field, the regulatory landscape is still developing. For example, the FDA has established the Office of Therapeutic Products (&#8220;OTP&#8221;) to oversee the review of genetic medicines and related products. It has also established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research on its review of gene therapy products. The FDA has also issued guidance documents, including a January 2024 final guidance entitled &#8220;Human Gene Therapy Products Incorporating Human Genome Editing&#8221; outlining the agency&#8217;s current recommendations regarding information that should be provided in an Investigational New Drug application (&#8220;IND&#8221;) in order to assess the safety and quality of the investigational product. The FDA&#8217;s regulatory requirements governing genetic and cellular medicines continue to evolve and we will need to monitor and adapt to these requirements as they develop. 

The same is true for activities in the European Union (the &#8220;EU&#8221;). The EMA&#8217;s Committee for Advanced Therapies (&#8220;CAT&#8221;) is responsible for assessing the quality, safety and efficacy of advanced-therapy medicinal products. The role of the CAT is to prepare a draft opinion on an application for marketing authorization for a genetic medicinal candidate that is submitted to the Committee for Human Medicinal Products (&#8220;CHMP&#8221;) before it adopts its final opinion. In the EU, the development and evaluation of a genetic medicinal product must be considered in the context of the relevant European Union guidelines. The EMA may issue new guidelines concerning the development and marketing authorization for genetic medicinal products and require that we comply with these new guidelines. As a result, the procedures and standards applied to genetic medicines and cell therapy products may be applied to any product candidates we may develop, but that remains uncertain at this point. 

These regulatory review committees and advisory groups and the new guidance they promulgate may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to perform additional studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of any product candidates we may develop or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. As we advance any product candidates we may develop, we will be required to consult with these regulatory and advisory groups and comply with applicable guidelines. If we fail to do so, we may be required to delay or discontinue development of these product candidates. Delay or failure to obtain, or unexpected costs in obtaining, the regulatory approval necessary to bring a potential product to market could decrease our ability to generate sufficient product revenue to maintain our business. 

Although the FDA decides whether individual genetic medicine protocols may proceed, the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (&#8220;RAC&#8221;) public review process, if undertaken, can delay the initiation of a clinical trial, even if the FDA has reviewed the trial design and details and approved its initiation. Conversely, the FDA can put an IND on a clinical hold even if the RAC has provided a favorable review or an exemption from in-depth, public review. If we were to engage a U.S. National Institutes of Health (&#8220;NIH&#8221;)-funded institution to conduct a clinical trial, that institution&#8217;s institutional biosafety committee as well as its institutional review board (&#8220;IRB&#8221;) would need to review the proposed clinical trial to assess the safety of the trial. In addition, adverse developments in clinical trials of genetic medicine products conducted by others may cause the FDA or other oversight bodies to change the requirements for approval of any product candidates we may develop. Similarly, the EMA may issue new guidelines concerning the development and marketing authorization for genetic medicine products and require that we comply with these new guidelines. 

As we are initially seeking to identify and develop product candidates to treat diseases using novel technologies, there is heightened risk that the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authority may not consider the clinical trial endpoints that we propose to provide clinically meaningful results. Even if the endpoints are deemed clinically meaningful, we may not achieve these endpoints to a degree of statistical significance, particularly because many of the diseases we are 

targeting with our platform have small patient populations, making development of large and rigorous clinical trials more difficult. 

Adverse developments in post-marketing experience or in clinical trials conducted by others of genetic medicines or cell therapy products may cause the FDA, the EMA, and other regulatory bodies to revise the requirements for development or approval of any product candidates we may develop or limit the use of products utilizing non-viral genetic medicinal technologies, either of which could materially harm our business. In addition, the clinical trial requirements of the FDA, the EMA, and other regulatory authorities and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of the potential products. The regulatory approval process for novel product candidates such as the product candidates we may develop can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or more extensively studied pharmaceutical or other product candidates. Regulatory agencies administering existing or future regulations or legislation may not allow production and marketing of products utilizing non-viral genetic medicine technology in a timely manner or under technically or commercially feasible conditions. In addition, regulatory action or private litigation could result in expenses, delays or other impediments to our research programs or the commercialization of resulting products. 

In addition, ethical, social and legal concerns about genetic medicine, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed their intentions to further regulate biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that any product candidates we may develop are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any products. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of any product candidates we may develop under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 

As we advance any product candidates we may develop through clinical development, we will be required to consult with these regulatory and advisory groups, and comply with applicable guidelines. These regulatory review committees and advisory groups and any new guidelines they promulgate may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to perform additional studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of any product candidates we may develop or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. Delay or failure to obtain, or unexpected costs in obtaining, the regulatory approval necessary to bring a potential product to market could decrease our ability to generate sufficient product revenue. 

We may not be successful in our efforts to identify, develop, or commercialize potential product candidates. 

The success of our business depends primarily upon our ability to identify, develop, and commercialize products based on our genome editing platform. All of our ongoing product development programs are in the preclinical or research stage of development. Our research programs, including those subject to our collaboration with BMS, may fail to identify potential product candidates for clinical development for a number of reasons. Our research methodology may be unsuccessful in identifying potential product candidates, or our potential product candidates may be shown to have smaller patient populations than initially estimated or may have harmful side effects or may have other characteristics or unforeseeable consequences that may make the products impractical to manufacture or commercialize, or unlikely to receive marketing approval. 

The occurrence of these events may force us to abandon our development efforts for a program or programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. For example, we recently decided to discontinue clinical development of reni-cel to focus on our in vivo preclinical programs. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial, and human resources. We may focus our efforts and resources on potential programs or product candidates that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful. For example, in December 2024, we announced the discontinuation of our Phase 1/2/3 RUBY trial of reni-cel for SCD and our Phase 1/2 EdiTHAL trial of reni-cel for TDT, following an extensive search to identify a commercial partner. Though reni-cel had demonstrated a favorable safety profile and promising preliminary efficacy, we determined not to pursue commercialization for reni-cel in order to optimize our cost structure and accelerate our in vivo pipeline development. 

The genome editing field is relatively new and is evolving rapidly. We are focusing our research and development efforts on CRISPR gene editing technology using Cas9 and Cas12a enzymes, but other genome editing technologies may be discovered that provide significant advantages over CRISPR/Cas9 or CRISPR/Cas12a, which could materially harm our business. 

To date, we have focused our efforts on genome editing technologies using CRISPR and the Cas9 and Cas12a (also known as Cpf1) enzymes. Other companies have previously undertaken research and development of genome editing technologies using zinc finger nucleases, engineered meganucleases, and transcription activator-like effector nucleases, but to date none has obtained marketing approval for a product candidate. There can be no certainty that these other genome editing technologies will not be considered better or more attractive for the development of medicines. Similarly, a new genome editing technology that has not been discovered yet may be determined to be more attractive than CRISPR. Moreover, if we decide to develop genome technologies other than CRISPR technology using a Cas9 or Cas12a enzyme, we cannot be certain we will be able to obtain rights to such technologies. Any of these factors could reduce or eliminate our commercial opportunity, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 

All of our ongoing product development programs are at the preclinical or research stage. Preclinical testing and clinical trials of product candidates may not be successful. If we are unable to commercialize any product candidates we develop or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed. 

Our ability to generate product revenues, which we do not expect will occur for many years, if ever, will depend heavily on our successful development and eventual commercialization of product candidates that we have identified or may identify in the future. The success of product candidates we may identify and develop will depend on many factors, including the following: 

&#8226; sufficiency of our financial and other resources to complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials; 

&#8226; successful completion of preclinical studies and IND&#8209;enabling studies; 

&#8226; successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials; 

&#8226; timely receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; 

&#8226; the performance of our future collaborators, if any; 

&#8226; the extent of any required post-marketing approval commitments to applicable regulatory authorities; 

&#8226; establishment and maintenance of supply arrangements with third-party raw materials suppliers and manufacturers for clinical development and, if approved, commercialization of our product candidates; 

&#8226; establishment and maintenance of arrangements with third-party manufacturers to obtain finished drug products that are appropriately packaged for sale; 

&#8226; successful development of our internal manufacturing processes and transfer to larger-scale facilities operated by either a contract manufacturing organization (&#8220;CMO&#8221;) or by us; 

&#8226; obtaining and maintaining patent, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally; 

&#8226; protection of our rights in our intellectual property portfolio; 

&#8226; successful launch of commercial sales following any marketing approval; 

&#8226; a continued acceptable safety profile following any marketing approval; 

&#8226; commercial acceptance by patients, the medical community and third-party payors following any marketing approval; and 

&#8226; our ability to compete with other therapies. 

If we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize any product candidates we may develop, which would materially harm our business. We currently generate no revenue from sales of any product and we may never be able to develop or commercialize a marketable product. 

In addition, if any product candidates encounter safety or efficacy problems, development delays, regulatory issues or other problems, our development plans and business could be significantly harmed. For the reasons described above, among others, regulatory authorities, particularly the FDA, have requested, and may request in the future, additional preclinical studies for genome editing products, such as additional studies related to toxicology, biodistribution or reproductive health, and/or preclinical studies earlier in clinical development compared to other therapeutic modalities. It is possible that the FDA may impose requirements that result in a delay of any of our programs or their regulatory approval of our product candidates. If we are unable to complete any required studies satisfactorily, the FDA or other regulatory authorities could require that we exclude certain patient populations from clinical studies, place our clinical studies on hold, or require us to cease further clinical studies or deny approval of such product candidates. Further, competitors that are developing ex vivo or in vivo products with similar technology may experience problems with their product candidates or programs that could in turn cause us to identify problems with our product candidates and programs, or cause the FDA or other regulatory authorities to impose additional requirements, that could cause us to delay or pause development of our product candidates. Any of these occurrences may harm our ability to identify and develop product candidates, and may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects significantly. We cannot guarantee that the FDA or other regulatory authorities will not change their requirements in the future or agree with our proposed regulatory strategies and filings. 

If serious adverse events, undesirable side effects, or unexpected characteristics are identified during the development of any product candidates we develop, we may need to abandon or limit our further clinical development of those product candidates. 

We have limited experience in evaluating product candidates in human clinical trials, having dosed our first patient in a clinical trial in 2020, and our proposed delivery modes, combined with CRISPR technology, have a limited history of being tested clinically. It is impossible to predict when or if any product candidates we develop will ultimately prove safe in humans. In the genomic medicine field, there have been several significant adverse events from gene therapy treatments in the past, including reported cases of leukemia and death. There can be no assurance that genome editing technologies will not cause severe or undesirable side effects. 

A significant risk in any genome editing product is that the edit will be &#8220;off-target&#8221; and cause serious adverse events, undesirable side effects, or unexpected characteristics. For example, off-target cuts could lead to disruption of a gene or a genetic regulatory sequence at an unintended site in the DNA. We cannot be certain that off-target editing will not occur in any of our future clinical studies. There is also the potential risk of delayed adverse events following exposure to genome editing therapy due to the potential for persistent biological activity of the genetic material or other components of products used to carry the genetic material. 

If any product candidates we develop are associated with serious adverse events, or undesirable side effects, or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon their development or limit development to certain uses or subpopulations in which the serious adverse events, undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe, or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 

If any of the product candidates we develop or the delivery modes we rely on cause undesirable side effects, it could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial potential, or result in significant negative consequences following any potential marketing approval. 

Product candidates we develop may be associated with off-target editing or other serious adverse events, undesirable side effects, or unexpected characteristics. In addition to serious adverse events or side effects caused by any product candidate we develop and test, the administration process or related procedures also can cause undesirable side effects. If any such events occur, our clinical trials could be suspended or terminated. If we are unable to demonstrate that such adverse events were caused by factors other than our product candidate, the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of, or deny approval of, any product candidates we are able to 

develop for any or all targeted indications. Even if we are able to demonstrate that all future serious adverse events are not product-related, such occurrences could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial. Moreover, if we elect, or are required, to delay, suspend or terminate any clinical trial of any product candidate we develop, the commercial prospects of such product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates may be delayed or eliminated. Any of these occurrences may harm our ability to identify and develop product candidates, and may harm our business, financial condition, result of operations, and prospects significantly. 

If we successfully develop a product candidate and it receives marketing approval, the FDA could require us to adopt a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (&#8220;REMS&#8221;) to ensure that the benefits of treatment with such product candidate outweighs the risks for each potential patient, which may include, among other things, a medication guide outlining the risks of the product for distribution to patients, a communication plan to health care practitioners, extensive patient monitoring, or distribution systems and processes that are highly controlled, restrictive, and more costly than what is typical for the industry. Furthermore, if we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by any of our product candidates, several potentially significant negative consequences could result, including: 

&#8226; regulatory authorities may suspend or withdraw approvals of such product candidate; 

&#8226; regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label; 

&#8226; we may be required to change the way a product candidate is administered or conduct additional clinical trials; 

&#8226; we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and 

&#8226; our reputation may suffer. 

Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of any product candidates we may identify and develop and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 

We have not extensively tested any of our proposed delivery modes in clinical trials and have not begun clinical trials in any of our current development programs. 

Our proposed delivery modes, combined with our product candidates, have a limited history of being evaluated in human clinical trials. Any of our product candidates may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy in later stages of clinical development despite having successfully advanced through initial clinical trials. 

There is a high failure rate for drugs and biologics proceeding through clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in later stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in earlier stage clinical trials. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are subject to varying interpretations, which may delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval. In addition, regulatory delays or rejections may be encountered as a result of many factors, including changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development. 

Any such adverse events may cause us to delay, limit, or terminate planned clinical trials, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 

Because we are developing product candidates for the treatment of diseases in which there is little clinical experience using new technologies, there is increased risk that the FDA, the EMA, or other regulatory authorities may not consider the endpoints of our future clinical trials to provide clinically meaningful results and that these results may be difficult to analyze. 

During the regulatory review process, we will need to identify success criteria and endpoints such that the FDA, the EMA, or other regulatory authorities will be able to determine the clinical efficacy and safety profile of our product candidates. As we are seeking to identify and develop product candidates to treat diseases in which there is little clinical experience using new technologies, there is heightened risk that the FDA, the EMA, or other regulatory authorities may not consider the clinical trial endpoints that we propose to provide clinically meaningful results. Even if the FDA does find our 

success criteria to be sufficiently validated and clinically meaningful, we may not achieve the pre-specified endpoints to a degree of statistical significance. This may be a particularly significant risk for many of the genetically defined diseases for which we plan to develop product candidates because many of these diseases have small patient populations, and designing and executing a rigorous clinical trial with appropriate statistical power is more difficult than with diseases that have larger patient populations. The FDA weighs the benefits of a product against its risks, and the FDA may view the efficacy results in the context of safety as not being supportive of regulatory approval. Any product candidates we develop will be based on a novel technology that makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of development and of subsequently obtaining regulatory approval. Only one genome editing therapeutic product has been approved in the United States or in Europe. 

If clinical trials of any product candidates we identify and develop fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities or do not otherwise produce positive results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of such product candidates. 

Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any of our product candidates, we must complete preclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy in humans of any such product candidates. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete, and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. 

We or our collaborators may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize any product candidates we may identify and develop, including: 

&#8226; delays in reaching a consensus with regulators on trial design; 

&#8226; regulators, IRBs or independent ethics committees (&#8220;IECs&#8221;) not authorizing us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site; 

&#8226; delays in reaching or failing to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective contract research organizations (&#8220;CROs&#8221;) and clinical trial sites; 

&#8226; clinical trials of any product candidates we develop producing negative or inconclusive results, and us deciding, or regulators requiring us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development or research programs; 

&#8226; the number of patients required for clinical trials of any product candidates we develop may be larger than we anticipate; the number of subjects willing to enroll may be smaller than required; enrollment of suitable participants in these clinical trials may be delayed or slower than we anticipate; or patients may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate; 

&#8226; our third-party contractors failing to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all; 

&#8226; regulators, IRBs, or IECs requiring that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research or clinical trials of any product candidates we develop for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements, a finding of undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, or that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or after an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites; 

&#8226; the supply or quality of any product candidates we develop or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of any product candidates we develop being insufficient or inadequate, including as a result of delays in the testing, validation, manufacturing, and delivery of any product candidates we develop to the clinical sites by us or by third parties with whom we have contracted to perform certain of those functions; 

&#8226; occurrence of serious adverse events associated with any product candidates we develop that are viewed to outweigh their potential benefits; and 

&#8226; changes in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols. 

If we or our collaborators are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of any product candidates we develop beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we or our collaborators are unable to successfully complete clinical trials or other tests of any product candidates we develop, or if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or only modestly positive, or if there are safety concerns, we or our collaborators may: 

&#8226; be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for any such product candidates we develop, or not obtain marketing approval at all; 

&#8226; obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired; 

&#8226; obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings, including boxed warnings; 

&#8226; be subject to changes in the way the product is administered; 

&#8226; be required to perform additional clinical trials to support approval or be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; 

&#8226; have regulatory authorities withdraw, or suspend, their approval of the product or impose restrictions on its distribution in the form of a modified risk evaluation and mitigation strategy; 

&#8226; be sued; or 

&#8226; experience damage to our reputation. 

Product development costs will also increase if we or our collaborators experience delays in testing or marketing approvals. We do not know whether clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured, or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize any product candidates we develop, could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, and could impair our ability to successfully commercialize any product candidates we develop, any of which may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 

If we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented. 

We or our collaborators may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for any of our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or analogous regulatory authorities outside the United States, or as needed to provide appropriate statistical power for a given trial. In addition, if patients are unwilling to participate in our genome editing trials because of negative publicity from adverse events related to the biotechnology, gene therapy, or genome editing fields, competitive clinical trials for similar patient populations, clinical trials in competing products, or for other reasons, the timeline for recruiting patients, conducting studies, and obtaining regulatory approval of any product candidates we develop may be delayed. Moreover, some of our competitors may have approved products or ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that would treat the same indications as any product candidates we develop, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead select the approved product or enroll in clinical trials of our competitors&#8217; product candidates. 

Patient enrollment is also affected by other factors, including: 

&#8226; severity of the disease under investigation; 

&#8226; size of the patient population and process for identifying patients; 

&#8226; design of the trial protocol; 

&#8226; availability and efficacy of approved medications for the disease under investigation; 

&#8226; availability of genetic testing for potential patients; 

&#8226; ability to obtain and maintain patient informed consent; 

&#8226; risk that enrolled patients will drop out before completion of the trial; 

&#8226; eligibility and exclusion criteria for the trial in question; 

&#8226; perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under trial; 

&#8226; perceived risks and benefits of genome editing as a therapeutic approach; 

&#8226; efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials; 

&#8226; patient referral practices of physicians; 

&#8226; ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; 

&#8226; proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients; and 

&#8226; negative publicity resulting from medicines approved by our competitors. 

The eligibility criteria of our clinical trials further limits the pool of available trial participants. Additionally, the process of finding and diagnosing patients may prove costly. Future pandemics or other global health crises may impact our ability to timely enroll trial participants and conduct our studies. 

Our ability to successfully initiate, enroll, and complete a clinical trial in any foreign country is subject to numerous risks unique to conducting business in foreign countries, including: 

&#8226; difficulty in establishing or managing relationships with CROs and physicians; 

&#8226; different standards for the conduct of clinical trials; 

&#8226; different standard-of-care for patients with a particular disease; 

&#8226; inability to locate qualified local consultants, physicians, and partners; and 

&#8226; potential burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws, medical standards, and regulatory requirements, including the regulation of pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and treatment. 

Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for any of our product candidates, which would cause the value of our company to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing. If we or our collaborators have difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients to conduct our clinical trials as planned, we may need to delay, limit, or terminate ongoing or planned clinical trials, any of which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 

We may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. 

Because we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on research programs and our product candidates for specific indications among many potential options. As a result, we may forgo or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial medicines or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable medicines. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing, or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to 

retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 

If we are unable to successfully identify patients who are likely to benefit from therapy with any medicines we develop, or experience significant delays in doing so, we may not realize the full commercial potential of any medicines we may develop. 

Our success may depend, in part, on our ability to identify patients who are likely to benefit from therapy with any of our medicines, which may require those potential patients to have their DNA analyzed for the presence or absence of a particular sequence. If we, or any third parties that we engage to assist us, are unable to successfully identify such patients, or experience delays in doing so, then: 

&#8226; our ability to develop any product candidates may be adversely affected if we are unable to appropriately select patients for enrollment in our clinical trials; 

&#8226; any product candidates we develop may not receive marketing approval if safe and effective use of such product candidates depends on an in vitro diagnostic; and 

&#8226; we may not realize the full commercial potential of any product candidates we develop that receive marketing approval if, among other reasons, we are unable to appropriately select patients who are likely to benefit from therapy with our medicines. 

As a result, we may be unable to successfully develop and realize the commercial potential of any product candidates we may identify and develop, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects would be materially adversely affected. 

Even if we complete the necessary clinical trials, we cannot predict when, or if, we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize a product candidate we develop, and any such approval may be for a more narrow indication than we seek. 

We cannot commercialize a product candidate until the appropriate regulatory authorities have reviewed and approved the product candidate. Even if any product candidates we develop meet their safety and efficacy endpoints in clinical trials, the regulatory authorities may not complete their review processes in a timely manner, or we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval. Additional delays may result if an FDA Advisory Committee or other regulatory authority recommends non-approval or restrictions on approval. In addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action, or changes in regulatory authority policy during the period of product development, clinical trials, and the review process. 

Regulatory authorities also may approve a product candidate for more limited indications than requested or they may impose significant limitations in the form of narrow indications, warnings or a REMS. These regulatory authorities may require precautions or contra-indications with respect to conditions of use, or they may grant approval subject to the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, regulatory authorities may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of any product candidates we develop. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects for any product candidates we develop and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 

Even if any product candidates we develop receive marketing approval, they may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payors, and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success. 

The commercial success of any of our product candidates will depend upon its degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors, and others in the medical community. The degree of market acceptance of any of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including: 

&#8226; the efficacy and safety of such product candidates as demonstrated in clinical trials; 

&#8226; the potential and perceived advantages compared to alternative treatments; 

&#8226; the limitation to our targeted patient population and limitations or warnings contained in approved labeling by the FDA or other regulatory authorities; 

&#8226; the ability to offer our medicines for sale at competitive prices; 

&#8226; convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments; 

&#8226; the clinical indications for which the product candidate is approved by the FDA, the European Commission, or other regulatory agencies; 

&#8226; public attitudes regarding genomic medicine generally and genome editing technologies specifically; 

&#8226; the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies, as well as their willingness to accept a therapeutic intervention that involves the editing of the patient&#8217;s genome; 

&#8226; product labeling or product insert requirements of the FDA, the EMA, or other regulatory authorities, including any limitations or warnings contained in a product&#8217;s approved labeling; 

&#8226; relative convenience and ease of administration; 

&#8226; the timing of market introduction of competitive products; 

&#8226; publicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments; 

&#8226; the strength of marketing and distribution support; 

&#8226; sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement; and 

&#8226; the prevalence and severity of any side effects. 

If any of our product candidates do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenues, and we may not become profitable. 

Adverse public perception of genomic medicines, and genome editing in particular, may negatively impact regulatory approval of, or demand for, our potential products. 

Our potential therapeutic products involve editing the human genome. The clinical and commercial success of our potential products will depend in part on public understanding and acceptance of the use of genome editing therapy for the prevention or treatment of human diseases. To date, only one genome editing therapy has been approved for sale by the FDA. Public attitudes may be influenced by claims that genome editing is unsafe, unethical, or immoral, and, consequently, our products may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. Adverse public attitudes may adversely impact our ability to enroll eligible patients in clinical trials. Moreover, our success will depend upon physicians prescribing, and their patients being willing to receive, treatments that involve the use of product candidates we develop in lieu of, or in addition to, existing treatments with which they are already familiar and for which greater clinical data may be available. 

In addition, genome editing technology is subject to public debate and heightened regulatory scrutiny due to ethical concerns relating to the application of genome editing technology to human embryos or the human germline. For example, academic scientists in several countries, including the United States, have reported on their attempts to edit the genome of human embryos as part of basic research and, in November 2018, Dr. Jiankui He, a Chinese biophysics researcher who was an associate professor in the Department of Biology of the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China, announced he had created the first human genetically edited babies, twin girls and helped create a second gene-edited pregnancy. The announcement was negatively received by the public, in particular by those in the scientific community. In the United States, germline editing for clinical application has been expressly prohibited since enactment of a December 2015 U.S. FDA ban on such activity. Prohibitions are also in place in the United Kingdom (the &#8220;UK&#8221;), across most of Europe, in China, and many other countries around the world. In the United States, the NIH has announced that it would not fund any use of genome editing technologies in human embryos, noting that there are multiple 

existing legislative and regulatory prohibitions against such work, including the Dickey-Wicker Amendment, which prohibits the use of appropriated funds for the creation of human embryos for research purposes or for research in which human embryos are destroyed. Laws in the UK prohibit genetically modified embryos from being implanted into women, but embryos can be altered in research labs under license from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. Basic research on embryos is more tightly controlled in many other European countries. 

Although we do not use our technologies to edit human embryos or the human germline, such public debate about the use of genome editing technologies in human embryos and heightened regulatory scrutiny could prevent or delay our development of product candidates. More restrictive government regulations or negative public opinion would have a negative effect on our business or financial condition and may delay or impair our development and commercialization of product candidates or demand for any products we may develop. 

If, in the future, we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to sell and market any of our product candidates, we may not be successful in commercializing those product candidates if and when they are approved. 

We do not have a sales or marketing infrastructure and have no experience in the sale, marketing, or distribution of pharmaceutical products. To achieve commercial success for any approved medicine for which we retain sales and marketing responsibilities, we must either develop a sales and marketing organization or outsource these functions to third parties. In the future, we may choose to build a focused sales, marketing, and commercial support infrastructure to sell, or participate in sales activities with our collaborators for, some of our product candidates if and when they are approved. 

There are risks involved with both establishing our own commercial capabilities and entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, recruiting and training a sales force or reimbursement specialists is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing and other commercialization capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our commercialization personnel. 

Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our medicines on our own include: 

&#8226; our inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel; 

&#8226; the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any future medicines; 

&#8226; the lack of complementary medicines to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and 

&#8226; unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent commercialization organization. 

If we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing, commercial support, and distribution services, our product revenues or the profitability of these product revenues to us may be lower than if we were to market and sell any medicines we may develop ourselves. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to commercialize our product candidates or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. We may have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our medicines effectively. If we do not establish commercialization capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidates. 

We face significant competition in an environment of rapid technological change, and our competitors may achieve regulatory approval before us or develop therapies that are safer or more advanced or effective than ours. 

The development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. Moreover, the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including in the gene therapy, genome editing and cell therapy fields, are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on intellectual property and proprietary products. We will face competition with respect to any of our product candidates now and in the future from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, and biotechnology companies worldwide. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private research organizations 

that conduct research, seek patent protection, and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization. 

There are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of the disease indications for which we have research programs. For hemoglobinopathies, these companies include Beam Therapeutics, bluebird bio, CRISPR Therapeutics, Ensoma, Kamau Therapeutics, Orna Therapeutics, Sanofi, Scribe Therapeutics, Tessera Therapeutics, Vertex, and Yoltech Therapeutics. Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to our approach, and others are based on entirely different approaches. For example, in late 2023 and early 2024, the FDA approved Vertex&#8217;s CASGEVY TM (exagamglogene autotemcel), a Cas9 genome-edited cell medicine, for the treatment of SCD and TDT. The FDA also approved in late 2023 bluebird bio&#8217;s LYFGENIA TM (lovotibeglogene autotemcel), a cell-based gene therapy, for the treatment of SCD. 

Our platform and product focus is the development of therapies using CRISPR technology specifically for genome editing. Other companies developing CRISPR Cas9 or Cas12a technology or therapies using CRISPR Cas9 or Cas12a technology include AvenCell Therapeutics, Caribou Biosciences, Cellestic, CRISPR Therapeutics, EdiGene, eGenesis, ERS Genomics, Excision Biotherapeutics, Inscripta, Intellia Therapeutics, Kamau Therapeutics, Sigma-Aldrich, ToolGen, and Yoltech Therapeutics. 

In addition, there have been and may continue to be discoveries of new CRISPR-based gene editing technologies. There are additional companies developing therapies using related CRISPR genome editing technologies, including other CRISPR nucleases, base editing, prime editing and gene writing. These companies include Amber Bio, Arbor Biotechnologies, Beam Therapeutics, Eligo Biosciences, Emendo Biotherapeutics, Ensoma, Epic Bio, Integra Therapeutics, KSQ Therapeutics, Locus Biosciences, Mammoth Biosciences, Metagenomi, nChroma Bio, Poseida Therapeutics, Prime Medicine, Profluent Bio, Scribe Therapeutics, Tessera Therapeutics, Tune Therapeutics, and Verve Therapeutics. 

There are also companies developing therapies using transcription activator-like effector nucleases, meganucleases, Mega-TALs and zinc finger nucleases. These companies include 2Seventy Bio, Allogene Therapeutics, bluebird bio, Cellectis, Precision Biosciences, and Sangamo Therapeutics. In addition to competition from other genome editing therapies, gene therapies or cell medicine therapies, any products that we may develop may also face competition from other types of therapies, such as small molecule, antibody, protein, oligonucleotide, or ribonucleic acid therapies. For hemoglobinopathies, these companies include Acceleron Pharma, Agios Pharmaceuticals, Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Pfizer, and Vertex. 

Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and gene therapy industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient, or are less expensive than any products that we may develop or that would render any products that we may develop obsolete or non-competitive. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Additionally, technologies developed by our competitors may render our potential product candidates uneconomical or obsolete, and we may not be successful in marketing any product candidates we develop against competitors. 

In addition, as a result of the expiration or successful challenge of our patent rights, we could face more litigation with respect to the validity and/or scope of patents relating to our competitors&#8217; products. The availability of our competitors&#8217; products could limit the demand, and the price we are able to charge, for any products that we may develop and commercialize. 

If we are able to commercialize any product candidates, such products may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices, or healthcare reform initiatives, which would harm our business. 

The regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing, and reimbursement for new medicines vary widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a medicine before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a medicine in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the medicine, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the medicine in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if any of our product candidates obtain marketing approval. 

Our ability to commercialize any medicines successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for these medicines and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers, and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the &#8220;IRA&#8221;) includes several measures intended to lower the cost of prescription drugs and related healthcare reforms, including limits on price increases and subjecting an escalating number of drugs to annual price negotiations with The Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;). We cannot be sure whether additional legislation or rulemaking related to the IRA will be issued or enacted, or what impact, if any, such changes will have on the profitability of any of our drug candidates, if approved for commercial use, in the future. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any medicine that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, the level of reimbursement. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. 

There may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for newly approved medicines, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the medicine is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any medicine will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale, and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new medicines, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the medicine and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost medicines and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for medicines may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of medicines from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable payment rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved medicines we may develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize medicines, and our overall financial condition. 

Due to the novel nature of our technology and the potential for some of our product candidates to offer therapeutic benefit in a single administration or limited number of administrations, we face uncertainty related to pricing and reimbursement for these product candidates. 

The pricing and reimbursement of any of our product candidates, if approved, must be adequate to support the necessary commercial infrastructure. If we are unable to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement, our ability to successfully market and sell any such product candidates will be adversely affected. The manner and level at which reimbursement is provided for services related to any of our product candidates, e.g., for administration of our product to patients, is also important. Inadequate reimbursement for such services may lead to physician resistance and adversely affect our ability to market or sell our products. In addition, it may be necessary for us to develop new reimbursement models in order to realize adequate value. Payors may not be able or willing to adopt such new models, and patients may be unable to afford that portion of the cost that such models may require them to bear. If we determine such new models are 

necessary but we are unsuccessful in developing them, or if such models are not adopted by payors, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be adversely affected. 

We expect the cost of a single administration of our genomic medicine products to be substantial, when and if they achieve regulatory approval. For example, the list price for Vertex&#8217;s Cas9 genome-edited cell medicine for the treatment of SCD and TDT is $2.2 million, while bluebird bio&#8217;s cell-based gene therapy for SCD has a list price of $3.1 million. We expect that coverage and reimbursement by government and private payors will be essential for most patients to be able to afford these treatments. Accordingly, sales of any such product candidates will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of any product candidates we develop will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit, and similar healthcare management organizations, or will be reimbursed by government authorities, private health coverage insurers, and other third-party payors. Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon several factors, including the third-party payor&#8217;s determination that use of a product is: 

&#8226; a covered benefit under its health plan; 

&#8226; safe, effective, and medically necessary; 

&#8226; appropriate for the specific patient; 

&#8226; cost-effective; and 

&#8226; neither experimental nor investigational. 

Obtaining coverage and reimbursement for a product from third-party payors is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to the payor supporting scientific, clinical, and cost-effectiveness data. There is significant uncertainty related to third-party coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement. If coverage and reimbursement are not available, or are available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be adequate to realize a sufficient return on our investment. If we are unable to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement, our ability to successfully market and sell any product candidates we develop will be harmed. 

Product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and could limit commercialization of any medicines that we may develop. 

We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing in human clinical trials of any of our product candidates and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any medicines that we may develop. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or medicines caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in: 

&#8226; decreased demand for any product candidates or medicines that we may develop; 

&#8226; injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention; 

&#8226; withdrawal of clinical trial participants; 

&#8226; significant time and costs to defend the related litigation; 

&#8226; substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients; 

&#8226; loss of revenue; and 

&#8226; the inability to commercialize any medicines that we may develop. 

Although we maintain product liability insurance coverage, it may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We anticipate that we will need to increase our insurance coverage if we successfully commercialize any medicine. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. 

If we or any contract manufacturers and suppliers we engage fail to comply with environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business. 

We and any contract manufacturers and suppliers we engage are subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental, health, and safety laws, regulations, and permitting requirements, including those governing laboratory procedures; the generation, handling, use, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous and regulated materials and wastes; the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air, and water; and employee health and safety. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological and radioactive materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. Under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for costs relating to any contamination at our current or past facilities and at third-party facilities. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties. 

Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research and product development efforts. In addition, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials or wastes. Although we maintain workers&#8217; compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not carry specific biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage, and our commercial general liability and umbrella liability policies specifically exclude coverage for damages and fines arising from biological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination. Accordingly, in the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages or be penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources, and our clinical trials or regulatory approvals could be suspended, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 

Any third-party contract manufacturers and suppliers we engage will also be subject to these and other environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. Liabilities they incur pursuant to these laws and regulations could result in significant costs or an interruption in operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 

Genomic medicines are novel, and our product candidates can be complex and difficult to manufacture. We could experience production problems that result in delays in our development or commercialization programs, limit the supply of our products, or otherwise harm our business. 

Our product candidates can require processing steps that are more complex than those required for most chemical pharmaceuticals. Moreover, unlike chemical pharmaceuticals, the physical and chemical properties of a biologic such as our product candidates generally cannot be fully characterized. As a result, assays of the finished product may not be sufficient to ensure that the product will perform in the intended manner. Problems with the manufacturing process, even minor deviations from the normal process, could result in product defects or manufacturing failures that result in lot failures, product recalls, product liability claims, or insufficient inventory. If we successfully develop product candidates, we may encounter problems achieving adequate quantities and quality of clinical-grade materials that meet FDA, EMA or other comparable applicable foreign standards or specifications with consistent and acceptable production yields and costs. 

In addition, the FDA, the EMA, and other regulatory authorities may require us to submit samples of any lot of any approved product together with the protocols showing the results of applicable tests at any time. Under some circumstances, the FDA, the EMA, or other regulatory authorities may require that we not distribute a lot until the agency authorizes its release. Slight deviations in the manufacturing process, including those affecting quality attributes and stability, may result in unacceptable changes in the product that could result in lot failures or product recalls. Lot failures or product recalls could cause us to delay clinical trials or product launches, which could be costly to us and otherwise harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 

We also may encounter problems hiring and retaining the experienced scientific, quality control, and manufacturing personnel needed to manage our manufacturing process, which could result in delays in our production or difficulties in maintaining compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. 

Given the nature of biologics manufacturing, there is a risk of contamination during manufacturing. Any contamination could materially harm our ability to produce product candidates on schedule and could harm our results of operations and cause reputational damage. Some of the raw materials that we anticipate will be required in our manufacturing process are derived from biologic sources. Such raw materials are difficult to procure and may be subject to contamination or recall. A material shortage, contamination, recall, or restriction on the use of biologically derived substances in the manufacture of any product candidates we develop could adversely impact or disrupt the commercial manufacturing or the production of clinical material, which could materially harm our development timelines and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 

Any problems in our manufacturing process or the facilities with which we contract could make us a less attractive collaborator for potential partners, including larger pharmaceutical companies and academic research institutions, which could limit our access to additional attractive development programs. Problems in third-party manufacturing process or facilities also could restrict our ability to ensure sufficient clinical material for any clinical trials we are planning to conduct and meet market demand for any products we commercialize. 

Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties 

We expect to depend on collaborations with third parties for the research, development, and commercialization of certain of the product candidates we develop or for development of certain of our research programs. If any such collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of those product candidates or research programs. 

We anticipate seeking third-party collaborators for the research, development, and commercialization of certain of the product candidates we develop or for development of certain of our research programs. Our likely collaborators include large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional and national pharmaceutical companies, and biotechnology companies. If we enter into any such arrangements with any third parties, we will likely have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of any product candidates we may seek to develop with them and, if applicable, whether they exercise any additional options to commercialize a product. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators&#8217; abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements. We cannot predict the success of any collaboration that we enter into. Further, despite a favorable safety profile and promising preliminary efficacy data, we may have difficulties identifying a commercial partner, which was the case for our former lead candidate reni-cel. 

Collaborations involving our research programs or any of our product candidates and alliance arrangements we may enter into under which our research programs or product candidates may be involved pose the following risks to us: 

&#8226; Collaborators may have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations. 

&#8226; Collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of any product candidates we develop or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborator&#8217;s strategic focus or available funding or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities. 

&#8226; Collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials, or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing. 

&#8226; Collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our medicines or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours. 

&#8226; Collaborators with marketing and distribution rights to one or more medicines may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such medicine or medicines. 

&#8226; Collaborators may not properly obtain, maintain, enforce, or defend our intellectual property or proprietary rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation. 

&#8226; Disputes may arise between the collaborators and us that result in the delay or termination of the research, development, or commercialization of our medicines or product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources. 

&#8226; We may lose certain valuable rights under circumstances identified in our collaborations, including if we undergo a change of control. 

&#8226; Collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates. 

&#8226; Collaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner or at all. If a present or future collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development or commercialization program under such collaboration could be delayed, diminished, or terminated. 

If our collaborations do not result in the successful development and commercialization of products, or if one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may not receive any milestone or royalty payments under such collaborations. If we do not receive the funding we expect under these agreements, our development of product candidates could be delayed, and we may need additional resources to develop product candidates. In addition, if one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to find a suitable replacement collaborator or attract new collaborators, and our development programs may be delayed or the perception of us in the business and financial communities could be adversely affected. All of the risks relating to product development, regulatory approval, and commercialization described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K apply to the activities of our collaborators. 

If we are not able to establish collaborations on commercially reasonable terms, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans. 

Our product development and research programs and the potential commercialization of any of our product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. For some of our product candidates and research programs, we may decide to collaborate with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of those product candidates or programs. 

We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator&#8217;s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration, and the proposed collaborator&#8217;s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions generally. The collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us. 

We may also be restricted under existing collaboration agreements from entering into future agreements on certain terms with potential collaborators or allies. For example, under our amended and restated collaboration with BMS, we may not use directly or indirectly, or license others to use, genome editing technology in connection with any research, development, manufacture, commercialization or other exploration of certain T cells, subject to certain exceptions, as more fully described in Part I, Item 1 &#8220;Business&#8212;Our Collaborations and Licensing Strategy&#8221; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Collaborations are also complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators. 

We may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of the product candidate for which we are seeking to collaborate, reduce or 

delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop product candidates or bring them to market and generate product revenue. 

We expect to rely on third parties to conduct our future clinical trials and some aspects of our research and preclinical testing, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials, research, or testing. 

We currently rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties to conduct some aspects of our research and preclinical testing. We previously relied and expect to rely in the future on third parties, such as CROs, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions, and clinical investigators, to conduct our future clinical trials. Any of these third parties may terminate their engagements with us at any time. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, our product development activities would be delayed. 

Our reliance on these third parties for research and development activities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with standards, commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practices, for conducting, recording, and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity, and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. We also are required to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within certain timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity, and civil and criminal sanctions. 

Furthermore, these third parties may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines, or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for any product candidates we develop and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our medicines. 

We also expect to rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of any product candidates we develop or commercialization of our medicines, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue. 

We contract with third parties for the manufacture of materials for our research programs and preclinical studies and previously did so and expect to do so in the future for clinical trials and for commercialization of any product candidates that we develop. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of such materials, product candidates, or any medicines that we may develop and commercialize, or that such supply will not be available to us at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent, or impair our development or commercialization efforts. 

We have a limited ability to manufacture materials for our research programs and preclinical studies and we do not operate any significant manufacturing facilities. While we currently perform some manufacturing for our internal programs, and previously performed cell processing for reni-cel, we primarily rely on third-party CMOs for the manufacture of our other materials for preclinical studies and expect to continue to do so for future clinical trials and for commercial supply of any product candidates that we develop and for which we or our collaborators obtain marketing approval. If we were to experience an unexpected loss or interruption of supply for any of our product candidates, whether as a result of manufacturing, supply or storage issues or otherwise, we could experience delays, disruptions, suspensions or terminations of, or be required to restart or repeat, any pending or ongoing clinical trials. Further, our product candidates may be composed of multiple components and require specialized formulations for which scale-up and manufacturing could be difficult. We have limited experience in such scale-up and manufacturing requiring us to depend on a limited number of third parties, who may not be able to deliver in a timely manner, or at all. In order to develop products, apply for regulatory approvals, and commercialize our products, we will need to develop, contract for, or otherwise arrange for the necessary manufacturing capabilities. 

Additionally, our product candidates have not yet been manufactured for commercial use. If any of our product candidates become approved for commercial sale, we will need to establish either internal or third-party manufacturing capacity. Manufacturing partner requirements may require us to fund capital improvements, perhaps on behalf of third parties, to support the scale-up of manufacturing and related activities. We may not be able to establish scaled manufacturing capacity for an approved product in a timely or economic manner, if at all. If we or our third-party manufacturers are unable to provide commercial quantities of such an approved product, we will have to successfully transfer manufacturing technology to a different manufacturer. Engaging a new manufacturer for such an approved product could require us to conduct comparative studies or utilize other means to determine bioequivalence of the new and prior manufacturers' products, which could delay or prevent our ability to commercialize such an approved product. If we or any of these manufacturers is unable or unwilling to increase its manufacturing capacity or if we are unable to establish alternative arrangements on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, the development and commercialization of such an approved product may be delayed or there may be a shortage in supply. Any inability to manufacture our product candidates or future approved drugs in sufficient quantities when needed would seriously harm our business. While we are exploring alternative suppliers for certain critical materials, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful. 

Third-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocations, seizures or recalls of product candidates or medicines, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our medicines and harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that might be capable of manufacturing for us. 

Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of any of our product candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any product candidates that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis. 

Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property 

If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for any products we develop and for our technology, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products and technology similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates, and our technology may be adversely affected. 

Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our CRISPR platform technology and any proprietary product candidates and technology we develop. We seek to protect our proprietary position by in-licensing intellectual property relating to our platform technology and filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our technologies and product candidates that are important to our business. If we or our licensors and/or collaborators are unable to obtain or maintain patent protection with respect to our CRISPR platform technology and any proprietary products and technology we develop, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially harmed. 

No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in the field of genome editing, including CRISPR technology, has emerged in the United States. The scope of patent protection outside of the United States is also uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions, obtain, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property rights and, more generally, could affect the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our owned and licensed patents. With respect to both in-licensed and owned intellectual property, we cannot predict whether the patent applications we and our licensors are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient protection from competitors. 

The patent prosecution process is expensive, time-consuming, and complex, and we may not be able to file, prosecute, maintain, enforce, or license all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output in time to obtain patent protection. Although we enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to confidential or patentable aspects of our research and development output, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, CROs, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors, and other third parties, 

any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose such output before a patent application is filed, thereby jeopardizing our ability to seek patent protection. 

Moreover, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Even if patent applications we license or own issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors or other third parties from competing with us, or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Any patents that we hold or in-license may be challenged, narrowed, circumvented, or invalidated by third parties. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our platform advances and product candidates will be protectable or remain protected by valid and enforceable patents. Our competitors or other third parties may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. For example, we are aware that third parties have suggested the use of the CRISPR technology in conjunction with a protein other than Cas9 or Cas12a. Our owned and in-licensed patents may not cover CRISPR technology in conjunction with a protein other than Cas9 or Cas12a. If our competitors commercialize the CRISPR technology in conjunction with a protein other than Cas9 or Cas12a, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially adversely affected. 

The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity, or enforceability, and our patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Our licensors are currently, and we or our licensors may in the future become, subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the &#8220;USPTO&#8221;) or opposition, derivation, revocation, re-examination, post-grant and inter partes review, or interference proceedings and other similar proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. Moreover, we, or one of our licensors, may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention or in post-grant challenge proceedings, such as oppositions in a foreign patent office, that challenge priority of invention or other features of patentability. Such challenges may result in loss of patent rights, loss of exclusivity, or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated, or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and product candidates. Such proceedings also may result in substantial cost and require significant time from our scientists and management, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. As discussed below, some of our in-licensed patents are subject to interference, opposition and ex parte re-examination proceedings and therefore subject to these risks. 

In addition, given the amount of time required for the development, testing, and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our intellectual property may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. Moreover, some of our owned and in-licensed patents and patent applications are, and may in the future be, co-owned with third parties. If we are unable to obtain an exclusive license to any such third party co-owners&#8217; interest in such patents or patent applications, such co-owners may be able to license their rights to other third parties, including our competitors, and our competitors could market competing products and technology. In addition, we or our licensors may need the cooperation of any such co-owners of our owned and in-licensed patents in order to enforce such patents against third parties, and such cooperation may not be provided to us or our licensors. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects. 

Furthermore, our owned and in-licensed patents and patent applications may be subject to a reservation of rights by one or more third parties. For example, the research resulting in certain of our owned and in-licensed patent rights and technology was funded in part by the U.S. government. As a result, the U.S. government has certain rights to such patent rights and technology. These rights may permit the U.S. government to disclose our confidential information to third parties and to exercise march-in rights to use or allow third parties to use our licensed technology. Any exercise by the government of any of the foregoing rights could harm our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 

Our rights to develop and commercialize our technology and product candidates are subject, in part, to the terms and conditions of licenses granted to us by others. 

We are heavily reliant upon licenses to certain patent rights and proprietary technology from third parties that are important or necessary to the development of our genome editing technology, including our CRISPR technology, and product candidates. These and other licenses may not provide exclusive rights to use such intellectual property and technology in all relevant fields of use and in all territories in which we may wish to develop or commercialize our technology and products in the future. As a result, we may not be able to prevent competitors from developing and commercializing competitive products in territories included in all of our licenses. For example, pursuant to our license agreements with The Broad Institute, Inc. (&#8220;Broad&#8221;), and Broad and the President and Fellows of Harvard College (&#8220;Harvard&#8221;), the licensors may, under certain circumstances, grant a license to the patents that are the subject of such license agreements to a third party. Such third party would have full rights to the patent rights that are the subject of such licenses, which could impact our competitive position and enable a third party to commercialize products similar to our future product candidates and technology. The terms of these license agreements are described more fully under Part I, Item 1 &#8220;Business&#8212;Our Collaborations and Licensing Strategy&#8221; in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

In addition, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, enforcement, and defense of patents and patent applications covering the technology that we license from third parties. For example, pursuant to each of our intellectual property licenses with Broad and Harvard, our licensors retain control of preparation, filing, prosecution, and maintenance, and, in certain circumstances, enforcement and defense of their patents and patent applications. Therefore, we cannot be certain that these patents and patent applications will be prepared, filed, prosecuted, maintained, enforced, and defended in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If our licensors fail to prosecute, maintain, enforce, and defend such patents, or lose rights to those patents or patent applications, the rights we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated, and our right to develop and commercialize any of our products that are the subject of such licensed rights could be adversely affected. Additionally, we are required to reimburse our licensors for all of their expenses related to the prosecution, maintenance, enforcement and defense of patents and patent applications that we in-license from them, and we anticipate that our obligation to reimburse our licensors for expenses related to these matters will continue to be substantial. 

Our licensors may have relied on third party consultants or collaborators or on funds from third parties such that our licensors are not the sole and exclusive owners of the patents and patent applications we in-license. For example, certain patent applications licensed to us by Broad are co-owned with NIH. Broad does not and does not purport to grant any rights in NIH&#8217;s interest in these patent applications under our agreement. If other third parties have ownership rights to our in-licensed patents and patent applications, they may be able to license such patents and patent applications to our competitors, and our competitors could market competing products and technology. This could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects. 

Some of our in-licensed patents are subject to priority and validity disputes. In addition, our owned and in-licensed patents, patent applications and other intellectual property may be subject to further priority and validity disputes, and other similar intellectual property proceedings including inventorship disputes. If we or our licensors are unsuccessful in any of these proceedings, we may be required to obtain licenses from third parties, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or to cease the development, manufacture, and commercialization of one or more of the product candidates we develop, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. 

Certain U.S. patents and a U.S. patent application directed to CRISPR/Cas9 that are co-owned by the Broad Institute and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (&#8220;MIT&#8221;), and in some cases Harvard (collectively referred to as &#8220;Broad&#8221;), and in-licensed by us were involved in a first interference with a U.S. patent application that is co-owned by the University of California, the University of Vienna, and Emmanuelle Charpentier (collectively referred to &#8220;CVC&#8221;). An interference is a proceeding in USPTO before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board of the USPTO (&#8220;PTAB&#8221;) to determine priority of invention of the subject matter of patent claims filed by different parties. In this first interference, the PTAB made a judgment of no interference-in-fact in favor of the Broad, which was upheld on appeal. This decision was final and bars any further interference between the same parties for claims to the same invention that was considered in the interference. As a result of this decision, the U.S. patents and application that we in-license from the Broad and others were not modified or revoked. 

On June 24, 2019, the PTAB declared a second interference between certain pending U.S. patent applications that are co-owned by CVC and certain U.S. patents and a U.S. patent application that are co-owned by Broad and in-licensed by us. Most of the Broad U.S. patents and the patent application that are involved in the second interference were also part of 

the first interference. The invention that was considered in the first interference related to a method involving contacting a target DNA in a eukaryotic cell with certain defined CRISPR/Cas9 components for the purpose of cleaving or editing that target DNA molecule or modulating transcription of at least one gene encoded thereon. The second interference is directed to a different invention, namely a eukaryotic cell comprising a target DNA and certain defined CRISPR/Cas9 components including a single molecule guide RNA that are capable of cleaving or editing the target DNA molecule. 

On September 10, 2020, the PTAB granted Broad&#8217;s motion for priority benefit while denying CVC priority benefit to their two earliest provisional patent applications. As a result, Broad entered the priority phase of the interference as &#8220;Senior Party&#8221; while CVC remained the &#8220;Junior Party&#8221; for purposes of determining which entity was the first to invent the inventions at issue. On February 28, 2022, the PTAB issued a decision regarding the priority phase of the interference determining that Broad was the first entity to invent the claims at issue. This decision has been appealed by CVC and the Broad has cross-appealed. Oral argument in the appeals occurred on May 7, 2024. It is uncertain when or in what manner the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit will act on these appeals. 

On December 14, 2020, the PTAB, declared two new interferences involving a pending U.S. patent application that is owned by ToolGen, Inc. (the &#8220;ToolGen application&#8221;). One of the two interferences is between the ToolGen application and certain U.S. patents and U.S. patent applications that are co-owned by Broad and in-licensed by us. Most of the Broad U.S. patents and patent applications that are involved in the interference with ToolGen are also part of the second interference with CVC. The other ToolGen interference is between the same ToolGen application and the U.S. patent applications that are co-owned by CVC and involved in the second interference with Broad. The claims in ToolGen&#8217;s patent application relate to a mammalian cell with a CRISPR/Cas system comprising a codon optimized nucleic acid encoding a Cas9 polypeptide with a nuclear localization signal and a single-molecule guide RNA that, together, are capable of forming a Cas9/RNA complex that mediates double stranded cleavage of a target nucleic acid sequence. On September 28, 2022, the PTAB suspended both of these interferences until the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issues a mandate in the pending appeals related to the second interference between Broad and CVC. 

On June 21, 2021, the PTAB declared two new interferences involving a pending U.S. patent application owned by Sigma-Aldrich (the &#8220;Sigma-Aldrich application&#8221;). One of the two new interferences is between the Sigma-Aldrich application and certain U.S. patents and U.S. patent applications that are co-owned by Broad and in-licensed by us. The other Sigma interference is between the same Sigma-Aldrich application and the U.S. patent applications that are co-owned by CVC. Most of the Broad U.S. patents and patent applications that are involved in the interference with Sigma-Aldrich are also part of the concurrent interferences with CVC and ToolGen. The claims in Sigma-Aldrich&#8217;s application relate to a method for modifying a chromosomal sequence in a eukaryotic cell by integrating a donor sequence into that chromosomal sequence. These methods use a CRISPR/Cas9 system comprising a Cas9 polypeptide with a nuclear localization signal, a guide RNA, and a donor sequence that, together, are capable of mediating double stranded cleavage and repair of a target nucleic acid sequence leading to integration of the donor sequence into the chromosomal sequence. On December 14, 2022, the PTAB suspended both of these interferences until the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issues a mandate in the pending appeals related to the second interference between Broad and CVC. 

As a result of these declarations of interference, five parallel adversarial proceedings in the USPTO before the PTAB have been initiated &#8211; the patent interferences between Broad and CVC, Broad and ToolGen, CVC and ToolGen, Broad and Sigma-Aldrich, and CVC and Sigma-Aldrich. We cannot predict with any certainty how long each interference proceeding will take. It is also possible that other third parties may seek to become a party to these interferences. 

Our owned and in-licensed patents and patent applications are, or may in the future become, subject to validity disputes in the USPTO and other foreign patent offices. For example, a request for ex parte re-examination was filed with the USPTO on February 16, 2016 against a U.S. patent that we have in-licensed from Broad, which is involved in certain of the interferences. The request for ex parte re-examination was granted on May 9, 2016 thereby initiating a re-examination procedure between the USPTO and Broad, acting on behalf of itself and MIT. The PTAB has suspended the re-examination noting that it has jurisdiction over any file that involves a patent involved in an interference. It is uncertain when the PTAB will lift the suspension. If Broad is unsuccessful during the re-examination, the patent in question may be revoked or narrowed, which could have a material adverse effect on the scope of our rights under such patent. 

We or our licensors may also be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators, or other third parties have an interest in our owned or in-licensed patents or patent applications, or other intellectual property rights as an inventor or co-inventor. If we are unable to obtain an exclusive license to any such third-party co-owners&#8217; interest in such patents, patent applications or other intellectual property rights, such co-owners may be able to license their rights to other third parties, including our competitors. In addition, we may need the cooperation of any such co-owners to enforce any patents, 

including any patents that issue from patent applications, against third parties, and such cooperation may not be provided to us. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the conduct of our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 

We or our licensors are subject to and may in the future become a party to similar proceedings or priority disputes in Europe or other foreign jurisdictions. For example, certain European patents that we have in-licensed from Broad have been revoked in their entirety by the European Patent Office Opposition Division (the &#8220;Opposition Division&#8221;). Certain other European patents that we have in-licensed from Broad were maintained with amended patent claims. Certain of these decisions have been appealed by both Broad and the opposing party(s), and it is uncertain when or in what manner the Boards of Appeal will act on these appeals. The Opposition Division has also initiated opposition proceedings against certain other European patents that we have in-licensed from Broad. The European Patent Office opposition proceedings may involve issues including, but not limited to, procedural formalities related to filing the European patent application, priority, and the patentability of the involved claims. In view of certain arguments made by the third parties against the revoked patents and similar arguments made by the third parties against other in-licensed European patents under opposition, the opposition proceedings may lead to the revocation of certain additional in-licensed European patents. The loss of priority for, or the loss of, these European patents could have a material adverse effect on the conduct of our business. One or more of the third parties that have filed oppositions against these European patents or other third parties may file future oppositions against other European patents that we in-license or own. There may be other oppositions against these European patents that have not yet been filed or that have not yet been made available to the public. 

If we or our licensors are unsuccessful in any patent related disputes, including interference proceedings, patent oppositions, re-examinations, or other priority, inventorship, or validity disputes to which we or they are subject (including any of the proceedings discussed above), we may lose valuable intellectual property rights through the loss of one or more patents owned or licensed or our owned or licensed patent claims may be narrowed, invalidated, or held unenforceable. In addition, if we or our licensors are unsuccessful in any inventorship disputes to which we or they are subject, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or the exclusive right to use, our owned or in-licensed patents and patent applications. If we or our licensors are unsuccessful in any interference proceeding or other priority or inventorship dispute, we may be required to obtain and maintain licenses from third parties, including parties involved in any such interference proceedings or other priority or inventorship disputes. Such licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or may be non-exclusive or may not be available at all. If we are unable to obtain and maintain such licenses, we may need to cease the development, manufacture, and commercialization of one or more of the product candidates we develop. The loss of exclusivity or the narrowing of our owned and in-licensed patent claims could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products. Any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects. Even if we are successful in any interference proceeding or other priority, inventorship, or validity disputes, it could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management and other employees. 

We may not be able to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights throughout the world. 

Filing, prosecuting, and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. In addition, our intellectual property license agreements may not always include worldwide rights. For example, certain U.S. patent applications licensed to us by Broad include The University of Tokyo (&#8220;Tokyo&#8221;) and NIH as joint applicants. Broad has only granted a license to us with respect to its interests and to Tokyo&#8217;s interests in these U.S. patent applications but not to any foreign equivalents thereof. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection or licenses but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. 

Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents and our intellectual property rights or marketing of competing products in violation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert 

our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license. 

Many countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patent. If we or any of our licensors is forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may be impaired, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects may be adversely affected. 

Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment, and other requirements imposed by government patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements. 

Periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees, and various other government fees on patents and applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various government patent agencies outside of the United States over the lifetime of our owned or licensed patents and applications. In certain circumstances, we rely on our licensing partners to pay these fees due to U.S. and non-U.S. patent agencies. The USPTO and various non-U.S. government agencies require compliance with several procedural, documentary, fee payment, and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We are also dependent on our licensors to take the necessary action to comply with these requirements with respect to our licensed intellectual property. In some cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. There are situations, however, in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in a partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, potential competitors might be able to enter the market with similar or identical products or technology, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 

If we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license intellectual property rights from third parties or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors, we could lose license rights that are important to our business. 

We have entered into license agreements with third parties and may need to obtain additional licenses from our existing licensors and others to advance our research or allow commercialization of product candidates we develop. It is possible that we may be unable to obtain any additional licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to redesign our technology, product candidates, or the methods for manufacturing them or to develop or license replacement technology, all of which may not be feasible on a technical or commercial basis. If we are unable to do so, we may be unable to develop or commercialize the affected product candidates, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects significantly. We cannot provide any assurances that third party patents do not exist which might be enforced against our current technology, including CRISPR genome editing technology, manufacturing methods, product candidates, or future methods or products resulting in either an injunction prohibiting our manufacture or sales, or, with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation to third parties, which could be significant. 

In each of our license agreements, and we expect in our future agreements, we are responsible for bringing any actions against any third party for infringing on the patents we have licensed. Certain of our license agreements also require us to meet development thresholds to maintain the license, including establishing a set timeline for developing and commercializing products. Disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a licensing agreement, including: 

&#8226; the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues; 

&#8226; the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement; 

&#8226; the sublicensing of patent and other rights under our collaborative development relationships; 

&#8226; our diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations; 

&#8226; the inventorship and ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners; and 

&#8226; the priority of invention of patented technology. 

In addition, the agreements under which we currently license intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, including the amount, if any, that may become due and payable to our licensors in connection with sublicense income. If these events were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects. 

We may not be successful in obtaining necessary rights to any product candidates we develop through acquisitions and in-licenses. 

We currently have rights to intellectual property, through licenses from third parties, to identify and develop product candidates. Many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and academic institutions are competing with us in the field of genome editing technology and filing patent applications potentially relevant to our business. For example, we are aware of third party patents and patent applications that may be construed to cover our CRISPR technology and product candidates. In order to avoid infringing these third party patents, or patents that issue from these third party patent applications, we may find it necessary or prudent to obtain licenses from such third party intellectual property holders. We may also require licenses from third parties for certain non-CRISPR technologies including certain delivery methods that we are evaluating for use with product candidates we develop. In addition, with respect to any patents we co-own with third parties, we may require licenses to such co-owners&#8217; interest in such patents. However, we may be unable to secure such licenses or otherwise acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of use, processes, or other intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify as necessary for our CRISPR technology and product candidates we develop. For example, certain methods for editing cells, guide RNA modifications and delivery modes that we are evaluating for use are covered by patents held by third parties. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third party intellectual rights or maintain the existing intellectual property rights we have, we may have to abandon development of the relevant program or product candidate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 

Issued patents covering our technology and product candidates could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court or before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad. 

If we or one of our licensors or our collaborators were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering a product candidate we develop or our technology, including CRISPR genome editing technology, the defendant could counterclaim that such patent is invalid or unenforceable. Third parties have raised challenges to the validity of certain of our in-licensed patent claims and may in the future raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. These and other proceedings could result in the revocation or cancellation of, or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our technology or platform, or any product candidates that we develop. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. If a third party were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our technology or platform, or any product candidates that we develop. Such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 

The intellectual property landscape around genome editing technology, including CRISPR, is highly dynamic, and third parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business. 

The field of genome editing, especially in the area of CRISPR technology, is still in its infancy, and only one CRISPR-based product has reached the market. Due to the intense research and development that is taking place by several companies, including us and our competitors, in this field, the intellectual property landscape is in flux, and it may remain uncertain for the coming years. There may be significant intellectual property related litigation and proceedings relating to our owned and in-licensed, and other third party, intellectual property and proprietary rights in the future. 

Our commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our collaborators to develop, manufacture, market, and sell any product candidates that we develop and use our proprietary technologies without infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating the intellectual property and proprietary rights of third parties. We are subject to and may in the future become party to, or threatened with, adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our technology and any product candidates we develop, including interference, re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, and derivation proceedings before the USPTO and similar proceedings in foreign jurisdictions such as oppositions before the European Patent Organisation. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future, regardless of their merit. We are aware of certain third party patents and patent applications in this landscape that may be asserted to encompass our CRISPR/Cas9 technology. In particular, we are aware of several separate families of U.S. patents and/or U.S. patent applications and foreign counterparts which relate to CRISPR/Cas9 technology, where the earliest priority dates of each family pre-date the priority dates of our in-licensed patents and patent applications, including patent families filed by Vilnius University, by the University of California, the University of Vienna, and Emmanuelle Charpentier, by ToolGen, and by Sigma-Aldrich. Each of these patent families are owned by a different third party and contain claims that may be construed to cover components and uses of CRISPR/Cas9 technology. If we are not able to obtain or maintain a license on commercially reasonable terms to any third-party patents that cover our product candidates or activities, such third parties could potentially assert infringement claims against us, which could have a material adverse effect on the conduct of our business. 

Even if we believe third-party intellectual property claims are without merit, there is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement, validity, enforceability, or priority. A court of competent jurisdiction could hold that these third party patents are valid, enforceable, and infringed, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to commercialize any product candidates we develop and any other product candidates or technologies covered by the asserted third party patents. If we are found to infringe a third party&#8217;s intellectual property rights, and we are unsuccessful in demonstrating that such patents are invalid or unenforceable, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing, manufacturing, and marketing any product candidates we develop and our technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors and other third parties access to the same technologies licensed to us, and it could require us to make substantial licensing and royalty payments. We also could be forced, including by court order, to cease developing, manufacturing, and commercializing the infringing technology or product candidates. In addition, we could be found liable for significant monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys&#8217; fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent or other intellectual property right. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 

If we do not obtain patent term extension and data exclusivity for any product candidates we may develop, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of any FDA marketing approval of any product candidates we may develop, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Action of 1984 (the &#8220;Hatch-Waxman Amendments&#8221;). The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent extension term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. However, an extension may not be granted because of, for example, failure to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, failure to apply within applicable deadlines, failure to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents, or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Further, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or if the term of any such extension is less than we request, we will be unable to rely on our patent position to forestall the marketing of competing products and/or competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expirations, and it could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 

We may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants, or advisors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their current or former employers or claims asserting ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property. 

Many of our employees, consultants, and advisors are currently or were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants, and advisors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these individuals have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such individual&#8217;s current or former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. 

In addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. The assignment agreements may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 

If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed. 

In addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and product candidates, we also rely on trade secrets and confidentiality agreements to protect our unpatented know-how, technology, and other proprietary information and to maintain our competitive position. With respect to our technology platform, we consider trade secrets and know-how to be one of our primary sources of intellectual property. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. In particular, we anticipate that with respect to our technology platform, these trade secrets and know-how will over time be disseminated within the industry through independent development, the publication of journal articles describing the methodology, and the movement of personnel from academic to industry scientific positions. 

We seek to protect these trade secrets and other proprietary technology, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, collaborators, CROs, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors, and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. We cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets or proprietary technology and processes. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is 

unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, our competitive position would be materially and adversely harmed. 

Risks Related to Regulatory Approval and Other Legal Compliance Matters 

Even if we complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials, the marketing approval process is expensive, time-consuming, and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of any of our product candidates. If we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize, or will be delayed in commercializing, our product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired. 

Any of our product candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries. Failure to obtain marketing approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate in a given jurisdiction. We have not received approval to market any product candidates from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction. We have only limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals and expect to rely on third-party CROs to assist us in this process. Securing regulatory approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the various regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the biologic product candidate&#8217;s safety, purity, and potency. Securing regulatory approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the relevant regulatory authority. Any of our product candidates may not be effective, may be only moderately effective, or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities, or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use. 

The process of obtaining marketing approvals, both in the United States and abroad, is expensive, may take many years if additional clinical trials are required, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity, and novelty of the product candidates involved. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. The FDA and comparable authorities in other countries have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical, or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit, or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved medicine not commercially viable. 

Further, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes, promulgation of regulations or issuance of guidance during preclinical or clinical development, or comparable changes in the regulatory review process for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. For example, in December 2022, with the passage of Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act (&#8220;FDORA&#8221;), Congress required sponsors to develop and submit a diversity action plan for each Phase 3 clinical trial or any other &#8220;pivotal study&#8221; of a new drug or biological product. These plans are meant to encourage the enrollment of more diverse patient populations in late-stage clinical trials of FDA regulated products. In June 2024, as mandated by FDORA, the FDA issued draft guidance outlining the general requirements for diversity action plans (&#8220;DAPs&#8221;). Unlike most guidance documents issued by the FDA, the DAP guidance when finalized will have the force of law because FDORA specifically dictates that the form and manner for submission of DAPs are specified in FDA guidance. On January 27, 2025, in response to an Executive Order issued by President Trump on January 21, 2025, on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion programs, the FDA removed this draft guidance from its website. This action raises questions about the applicability of statutory obligations to submit DAPs and the agency&#8217;s current thinking on best practices for clinical development. 

Further, on January 31, 2022, the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 became applicable in the EU and replaced the prior Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. The new regulation aims at simplifying and streamlining the authorization, conduct and transparency of clinical trials in the EU. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval of clinical trials, the sponsor of a clinical trial to be conducted in more than one Member State of the EU (&#8220;EU Member 

State&#8221;) will only be required to submit a single application for approval. The submission will be made through the Clinical Trials Information System, a new clinical trials portal overseen by the EMA and available to clinical trial sponsors, competent authorities of the EU Member States and the public. We have not previously secured authorization to conduct clinical studies in the EU pursuant to this new regulation and, accordingly, there is a risk that we may be delayed in commencing any such studies. 

If we experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of any of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for those product candidates may be harmed, and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired. 

We may seek certain designations for our product candidates, including Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track and Priority Review designations in the US, and PRIME Designation in the EU, but we might not receive such designations, and even if we do, such designations may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process. 

We may seek certain designations for one or more of our product candidates that could expedite review and approval by the FDA. A Breakthrough Therapy product is defined as a product that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. For products that have been designated as Breakthrough Therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. 

The FDA may also designate a product for Fast Track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other products, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For Fast Track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product&#8217;s application before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a Fast Track product may be effective. 

We may also seek a priority review designation for one or more of our product candidates. If the FDA determines that a product candidate is intended to treat a serious disease or condition and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of such disease or condition, the FDA may designate the product candidate for priority review. A priority review designation means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review period of ten months. 

These designations are within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe that one of our product candidates meets the criteria for these designations, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. Further, even if we receive a designation, the receipt of such designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development or regulatory review or approval process compared to products considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one or more of our product candidates qualifies for these designations, the FDA may later decide that the product candidates no longer meet the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. 

In the EU, we may seek PRIME designation for some of our product candidates in the future. PRIME is a voluntary program aimed at enhancing the EMA&#8217;s role to reinforce scientific and regulatory support in order to optimize development and enable accelerated assessment of new medicines that are of major public health interest with the potential to address unmet medical needs. The program focuses on medicines that target conditions for which there exists no satisfactory method of treatment in the EU or even if such a method exists, it may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments. PRIME is limited to medicines under development and not authorized in the EU and the applicant intends to apply for an initial marketing authorization application through the centralized procedure. To be accepted for PRIME, a product candidate must meet the eligibility criteria in respect of its major public health interest and therapeutic innovation based on information that is capable of substantiating the claims. The benefits of a PRIME designation include the appointment of a CHMP rapporteur to provide continued support and help to build knowledge ahead of a marketing authorization application, early dialogue and scientific advice at key development milestones, and the potential to qualify products for accelerated review, meaning reduction in the review time for an opinion on approvability to be issued earlier in the application process. PRIME enables an applicant to request parallel EMA scientific advice and health technology assessment advice to facilitate timely market access. Even if we receive PRIME designation for any of our product 

candidates, the designation may not result in a materially faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional EMA procedures. Further, obtaining PRIME designation does not assure or increase the likelihood of EMA&#8217;s grant of a marketing authorization. 

If approved, our product candidates that are licensed and regulated as biologics may face competition from biosimilars approved through an abbreviated regulatory pathway. 

The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, (&#8220;BPCIA&#8221;), was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, (&#8220;ACA&#8221;), to establish an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as &#8220;interchangeable&#8221; based on its similarity to an approved biologic. 

Under the BPCIA, a reference biological product is granted 12 years of regulatory exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product In addition, the licensure of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still develop and receive approval of a competing biologic, so long as its BLA does not reply on the reference product, sponsor&#8217;s data or submit the application as a biosimilar application. The law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning are subject to uncertainty, and any new policies or processes adopted by the FDA could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products. 

In December 2022, Congress clarified through FDORA that the FDA may approve multiple first interchangeable biosimilar biological products so long as the products are all approved on the first day on which such a product is approved as interchangeable with the reference product and the exclusivity period may be shared amongst multiple first interchangeable products. There have been recent government proposals to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period, but none has been enacted to date. At the same time, since passage of the BPCIA, many states have passed laws or amendments to laws, which address pharmacy practices involving biosimilar products. 

We believe that any of the product candidates we develop as a biological product under a BLA should qualify for the 12-year period of exclusivity. However, there is a risk that this exclusivity could be shortened due to congressional action or otherwise, or that the FDA will not consider the subject product candidates to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for biosimilar competition sooner than anticipated. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of the reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. Nonetheless, the approval of a biosimilar to our product candidates would have a material adverse impact on our business due to increased competition and pricing pressure. 

We may not be able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for one or more of our product candidates, and even if we do, that exclusivity may not prevent the FDA or the EMA from approving other competing products. 

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition. A similar regulatory scheme governs approval of orphan products by the EMA in the EU. Generally, if a product candidate with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA or the EMA from approving another marketing application for the same product for the same therapeutic indication for that time period. The applicable period is seven years in the United States and ten years in the EU. The exclusivity period in the EU can be reduced to six years if a product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, in particular if the product is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. 

In order for the FDA to grant orphan drug exclusivity to one of our products, the agency must find that the product is indicated for the treatment of a condition or disease with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States. The FDA may conclude that the condition or disease for which we seek orphan drug exclusivity does not meet this standard. Even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different products can be approved for the same condition. In particular, the concept of what constitutes the ""same drug"" for purposes of orphan drug exclusivity remains in flux in the context of gene therapies. 

In September 2021, the FDA issued final guidance describing its current thinking on when a gene therapy product is the &#8220;same&#8221; as another product for purposes of orphan exclusivity. Under the guidance, if either the transgene or vector differs between two gene therapy products in a manner that does not reflect &#8220;minor&#8221; differences, the two products would be considered different drugs for orphan drug exclusivity purposes. The FDA will determine whether two vectors from the same viral class are the same on a case-by-case basis and may consider additional key features in assessing sameness. In addition, even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same product for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later product is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity may also be lost if the FDA or EMA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the product to meet the needs of the patients with the rare disease or condition. 

On August 3, 2017, Congress passed the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (&#8220;FDARA&#8221;). FDARA, among other things, codified the FDA&#8217;s pre-existing regulatory interpretation, to require that a drug sponsor demonstrate the clinical superiority of an orphan drug that is otherwise the same as a previously approved drug for the same rare disease in order to receive orphan drug exclusivity. The new legislation reverses prior precedent holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously requires that the FDA recognize the orphan exclusivity period regardless of a showing of clinical superiority. Further, under Omnibus legislation signed by President Trump on December 27, 2020, the requirement for a product to show clinical superiority applies to drugs and biologics that received orphan drug designation before enactment of FDARA in 2017, but have not yet been approved or licensed by the FDA. 

The FDA may further reevaluate the Orphan Drug Act and its regulations and policies. This may be particularly true in light of a decision from the Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in September 2021 finding that, for the purpose of determining the scope of exclusivity, the term &#8220;same disease or condition&#8221; means the designated &#8220;rare disease or condition&#8221; and could not be interpreted by the FDA to mean the &#8220;indication or use.&#8221; Thus, the court concluded, orphan drug exclusivity applies to the entire designated disease or condition rather than the &#8220;indication or use.&#8221; Although there have been legislative proposals to overrule this decision, they have not been enacted into law. 

On January 23, 2023, the FDA announced that, in matters beyond the scope of that court order, the FDA will continue to apply its existing regulations tying orphan-drug exclusivity to the uses or indications for which the orphan drug was approved. We do not know if, when, or how the FDA may change the orphan drug regulations and policies in the future, and it is uncertain how any changes might affect our business. Depending on what changes the FDA may make to its orphan drug regulations and policies, our business could be adversely impacted. 

Failure to obtain marketing approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent any of our product candidates from being marketed in such jurisdictions, which, in turn, would materially impair our ability to generate revenue. 

In order to market and sell any of our product candidates in the EU and many other foreign jurisdictions, we or our collaborators must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. We or these third parties may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our medicines in any jurisdiction, which would materially impair our ability to generate revenue. 

Additionally, we could face heightened risks with respect to obtaining marketing authorization in the UK as a result of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit. The UK is no longer part of the European Single Market and EU Customs Union. As of January 1, 2025, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (&#8220;MHRA&#8221;), is responsible for approving all medicinal products destined for the UK market (i.e., Great Britain and Northern Ireland). At the same time, a new international recognition procedure (&#8220;IRP&#8221;) will apply, which intends to facilitate approval of pharmaceutical products in the UK. The IRP is open to applicants that have already received an authorization for the same product from one of the MHRA&#8217;s specified Reference Regulators (&#8220;RRs&#8221;). The RRs notably include EMA and regulators in the EU/European Economic Area (&#8220;EEA&#8221;) member states for approvals in the EU centralized procedure and mutual recognition procedure as well as the FDA (for product approvals granted in the U.S.). 

However, the concrete functioning of the IRP is currently unclear. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals may force us or our collaborators to restrict or delay efforts to seek regulatory approval in the UK for our product candidates, which could significantly and materially harm our business. 

In addition, foreign regulatory authorities may change their approval policies and new regulations may be enacted. For instance, the EU pharmaceutical legislation is currently undergoing a complete review process, in the context of the Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe initiative, launched by the European Commission in November 2020. The European Commission&#8217;s proposal for revision of several legislative instruments related to medicinal products (potentially reducing the duration of regulatory data protection, revising the eligibility for expedited pathways, etc.) was published on April 26, 2023. The proposed revisions remain to be agreed and adopted by the European Parliament and European Council and the proposals may therefore be substantially revised before adoption, which is not anticipated before early 2026. The revisions may however have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry and our business in the long term. 

We expect that we will be subject to additional risks in commercializing any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval outside the United States, including tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements; economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets (such as the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia); compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad; foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country; and workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States. 

Even if we, or any collaborators we may have, obtain marketing approvals for any of our product candidates, the terms of approvals and ongoing regulation of our products could require the substantial expenditure of resources and may limit how we, or they, manufacture and market our products, which could materially impair our ability to generate revenue. 

Any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising, and promotional activities for such medicine, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, cGMP requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, and requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the medicine may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the medicine. 

In addition, we could be adversely affected by several significant administrative law cases decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2024. In Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo , for example, the court overruled Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc ., which for 40 years required federal courts to defer to permissible agency interpretations of statutes that are silent or ambiguous on a particular topic. The U.S. Supreme Court stripped federal agencies of this presumptive deference and held that courts must exercise their independent judgment when deciding whether an agency such as the FDA acted within its statutory authority under the Administrative Procedure Act (&#8220;APA&#8221;). Additionally, in Corner Post, Inc. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , the court held that actions to challenge a federal regulation under the APA can be initiated within six years of the date of injury to the plaintiff, rather than the date the rule is finalized. The decision appears to give prospective plaintiffs a personal statute of limitations to challenge longstanding agency regulations. Another decision, Securities and Exchange Commission v. Jarkesy , overturned regulatory agencies&#8217; ability to impose civil penalties in administrative proceedings. These decisions could introduce additional uncertainty into the regulatory process and may result in additional legal challenges to actions taken by federal regulatory agencies, including the FDA and the CMS, that we rely on. In addition to potential changes to regulations as a result of legal challenges, these decisions may result in increased regulatory uncertainty and delays and other impacts, any of which could adversely impact our business and operations. 

Further, our ability to develop and market new drug products may be impacted by litigation challenging the FDA&#8217;s approval of another company&#8217;s drug product. In April 2023, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas invalidated the approval by the FDA of mifepristone, a drug product which was originally approved in 2000 and whose distribution is governed by various measures adopted under a REMS. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit declined to order the removal of mifepristone from the market but did hold that plaintiffs were likely to prevail in their claim that changes allowing for expanded access of mifepristone, which the FDA authorized in 2016 and 2021, were 

arbitrary and capricious. In June 2024, the Supreme Court reversed that decision after unanimously finding that the plaintiffs (anti-abortion doctors and organizations) did not have standing to bring this legal action against the FDA. On October 11, 2024, the Attorneys General of three states (Missouri, Idaho and Kansas) filed an amended complaint in the district court in Texas challenging the FDA&#8217;s actions. On January 16, 2025, the district court agreed to allow these states to file an amended complaint and continue to pursue this challenge. Depending on the outcome of this litigation, our ability to develop new drug product candidates and to maintain approval of existing drug products could be delayed, undermined or subject to protracted litigation. 

Finally, with the change in presidential administrations in 2025, there is substantial uncertainty as to how, if at all, the new administration will seek to modify or revise the requirements and policies of the FDA and other regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over our product candidates. The impending uncertainty could present new challenges or potential opportunities as we navigate the clinical development and approval process for our product candidates. 

Accordingly, assuming we, or any collaborators we may have, receive marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates, we, and such collaborators, and our and their contract manufacturers will continue to expend time, money, and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, product surveillance, and quality control. If we and such collaborators are not able to comply with post-approval regulatory requirements, we and such collaborators could have the marketing approvals for our products withdrawn by regulatory authorities and our, or such collaborators&#8217;, ability to market any future products could be limited, which could adversely affect our ability to achieve or sustain profitability. Further, the cost of compliance with post-approval regulations may have a negative effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and prospects. 

Inadequate funding for the FDA, the SEC and other government agencies, including from government shut downs, or other disruptions to these agencies&#8217; operations, could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business. 

The ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new product candidates to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. In addition, government funding of the SEC and other government agencies on which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities, is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. 

Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new product candidates to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and the SEC, have had to furlough critical FDA, SEC and other government employees and stop critical activities. In addition, disruptions may result from events similar to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of companies announced receipt of complete response letters due to the FDA&#8217;s inability to complete required inspections for their applications. In the event of a similar public health emergency in the future, the FDA may not be able to continue its current pace and review timelines could be extended. Regulatory authorities outside the United States facing similar circumstances may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to a similar public health emergency and may also experience delays in their regulatory activities. 

Accordingly, if a prolonged government shutdown or other disruption occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Future shutdowns or other disruptions could also affect other government agencies such as the SEC, which may also impact our business by delaying review of our public filings, to the extent such review is necessary, and our ability to access the public markets. 

Even if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they will be subject to significant post-marketing regulatory requirements and oversight. 

Any regulatory approvals that we may receive for our product candidates will require the submission of reports to regulatory authorities and ongoing surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate, may contain 

significant limitations related to use restrictions for specified age groups, warnings, precautions or contraindications, and may include burdensome post-approval study or risk management requirements and regulatory inspection. For example, the FDA may require a REMS in order to approve our product candidates, which could entail requirements for a medication guide, physician training and communication plans or additional elements to ensure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. In addition, if the FDA, EMA or foreign regulatory authorities approve our product candidates, the manufacturing processes, labelling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, import, export and recordkeeping for our product candidates will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as ongoing compliance with cGMPs and good clinical practices (GCP) for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. 

In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic, unannounced inspections by the FDA, EMA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations and standards. The PREVENT Pandemics Act, which was enacted in December 2022, clarifies that foreign drug manufacturing establishments are subject to registration and listing requirements even if a drug or biologic undergoes further manufacture, preparation, propagation, compounding, or processing at a separate establishment outside the U.S. prior to being imported or offered for import into the U.S. If we or a regulatory authority discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facilities where the product is manufactured, a regulatory authority may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing. In addition, failure to comply with FDA, EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory requirements may subject our company to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including: 

&#8226; delays in or the rejection of product approvals; 

&#8226; restrictions on our ability to conduct clinical trials, including full or partial clinical holds on ongoing or planned trials; 

&#8226; restrictions on the products, manufacturers or manufacturing process; 

&#8226; warning or untitled letters; 

&#8226; civil and criminal penalties; 

&#8226; injunctions; 

&#8226; suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals; 

&#8226; product seizures, detentions or import bans; 

&#8226; voluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements; 

&#8226; total or partial suspension of production; 

&#8226; imposition of restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; 

&#8226; revisions to the labelling, including limitation on approved uses or the addition of additional warnings, contraindications or other safety information, including boxed warnings; 

&#8226; imposition of a REMS, which may include distribution or use restrictions; and 

&#8226; requirements to conduct additional post-market clinical trials to assess the safety of the product. 

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the U.S. market, and the relevant foreign regulatory agencies do the same in their respective jurisdictions. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. In September 2021, the FDA published final regulations which describe the types of evidence that the agency will consider in determining the intended use of a 

drug product. Physicians may nevertheless prescribe our products off-label to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label. We intend to implement compliance and training programs designed to ensure that any of our sales and marketing practices comply with applicable regulations. Notwithstanding these programs, the FDA or other government agencies may allege or find that our practices constitute prohibited promotion of our products for unapproved uses. We also cannot be sure that our employees will comply with Company policies and applicable regulations regarding the promotion of products for unapproved uses. 

Notwithstanding the regulatory restrictions on off-label promotion, the FDA and other regulatory authorities allow companies to engage in truthful, non-misleading, and non-promotional scientific communications concerning their products in certain circumstances. For example, January 2025, the FDA published final guidance outlining the agency&#8217;s non-binding policies governing the distribution of scientific information on unapproved uses to healthcare providers. This final guidance calls for such communications to be truthful, non-misleading, factual, and unbiased and include all information necessary for healthcare providers to interpret the strengths and weaknesses and validity and utility of the information about the unapproved use. In addition, under some relatively recent guidance from the FDA and the Pre-Approval Information Exchange Act (&#8220;PIE Act&#8221;), signed into law as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023, companies may also promote information that is consistent with the prescribing information and proactively speak to formulary committee members of payors regarding data for an unapproved drug or unapproved uses of an approved drug. We may engage in these discussions and communicate with healthcare providers, payors and other constituencies in compliance with all applicable laws, regulatory guidance and industry best practices. We will need to carefully navigate the FDA&#8217;s various regulations, guidance and policies, along with recently enacted legislation, to ensure compliance with restrictions governing promotion of our products. 

In recent years, a significant number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have been the target of inquiries and investigations by various federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales practices, including the Department of Justice and various U.S. Attorneys&#8217; Offices, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (the &#8220;HHS&#8221;), the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;), and various state Attorneys General offices. These investigations have alleged violations of various federal and state laws and regulations, including claims asserting antitrust violations, violations of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the False Claims Act, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act and anti-kickback laws and other alleged violations in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses, pricing and Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement. Many of these investigations originate as &#8220; qui tam &#8221; actions under the False Claims Act. Under the False Claims Act, any individual can bring a claim on behalf of the government alleging that a person or entity has presented a false claim or caused a false claim to be submitted to the government for payment. The person bringing a qui tam suit is entitled to a share of any recovery or settlement. Qui tam suits, also commonly referred to as &#8220;whistleblower suits,&#8221; are often brought by current or former employees. In a qui tam suit, the government must decide whether to intervene and prosecute the case. If it declines, the individual may pursue the case alone. 

Similar restrictions apply to the approval of our products in the EU. The holder of a marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products. These include: compliance with the EU&#8217;s stringent pharmacovigilance or safety reporting rules, which can impose post-authorization studies and additional monitoring obligations; the manufacturing of authorized medicinal products, for which a separate manufacturer&#8217;s license is mandatory; and the marketing and promotion of authorized drugs, which are strictly regulated in the EU. and are also subject to EU. Member State laws. The failure to comply with these and other EU requirements can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions. 

The FDA, EMA and other regulatory authorities&#8217; policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability. 

Our relationships with healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, and diminished profits and future earnings. 

Healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell, and distribute our medicines for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following: 

&#8226; the federal healthcare anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid; 

&#8226; the federal False Claims Act imposes criminal and civil penalties, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment or approval from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government payors that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease, or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government, with potential liability including mandatory treble damages and significant per-claim penalties; 

&#8226; the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as further amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which imposes certain requirements, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization by entities subject to the rule, such as health plans, health care clearinghouses, and health care providers; 

&#8226; the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services; 

&#8226; the federal transparency requirements under the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report to the HHS information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations; and 

&#8226; analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, and certain state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry&#8217;s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. 

Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other government regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 

The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order, or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the EU. The provision of benefits or 

advantages to physicians is also governed by the national anti-bribery laws of EU Member States, such as the UK Bribery Act 2010. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. 

Payments made to physicians in certain EU Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician&#8217;s employer, his or her competent professional organization, and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct applicable in the EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines, or imprisonment. 

Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil, or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. Liabilities they incur pursuant to these laws could result in significant costs or an interruption in operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 

Enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us and any future collaborators to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we, or they, may obtain. 

In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could, among other things, prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability, or the ability of any future collaborators, to profitably sell any products for which we, or they, obtain marketing approval. We expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we, or any future collaborators, may receive for any approved products. 

In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the ACA. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation&#8217;s automatic reduction to several government programs. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2031 under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. 

Under current legislation, the actual reductions in Medicare payments may vary up to 4%. The Consolidated Appropriations Act (the &#8220;CAA&#8221;), which was signed into law by President Biden in December 2022, made several changes to sequestration of the Medicare program. Section 1001 of the CAA delays the 4% Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 (PAYGO) sequester for two years, through the end of calendar year 2024. Triggered by the enactment of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, the 4% cut to the Medicare program would have taken effect in January 2023. The CAA&#8217;s health care offset title includes Section 4163, which extends the 2% Budget Control Act of 2011 Medicare sequester for six months into fiscal year 2032 and lowers the payment reduction percentages in fiscal years 2030 and 2031. 

Since enactment of the ACA, there have been and continue to be, numerous legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. For example, with enactment of the Tax Cuts for Jobs Act in 2017, Congress repealed the &#8220;individual mandate.&#8221; The repeal of this provision, which requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health insurance, became effective in 2019. In June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the statute. Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results. 

The prices of prescription pharmaceuticals in the United States and foreign jurisdictions is subject to considerable legislative and executive actions and could impact the prices we obtain for our products, if and when licensed. 

The prices of prescription pharmaceuticals have also been the subject of considerable discussion in the United States. There have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries, as well as proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to pharmaceutical pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reduce the costs of pharmaceuticals under Medicare and Medicaid. 

In addition, in October 2020, the HHS and the FDA published a final rule allowing states and other entities to develop a Section 804 Importation Program (&#8220;SIP&#8221;) to import certain prescription drugs from Canada into the United States. That regulation was challenged in a lawsuit by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (&#8220;PhRMA&#8221;) but the case was dismissed by a federal district court in February 2023 after the court found that PhRMA did not have standing to sue the HHS. Seven states (Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Texas and Vermont) have passed laws allowing for the importation of drugs from Canada. North Dakota &#8239;and Virginia &#8239;have passed legislation establishing workgroups to examine the impact of a state importation program.&#8239;As of October 2024, five states (Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Hampshire and New Mexico) had submitted Section 804 Importation Program proposals to the FDA. Vermont has submitted a concept letter to the HHS. On January 5, 2024, the FDA approved Florida&#8217;s plan for Canadian drug importation. That state now has authority to import certain drugs from Canada for a period of two years once certain conditions are met. Florida will first need to submit a pre-import request for each drug selected for importation, which must be approved by the FDA. The state will also need to relabel the drugs and perform quality testing of the products to meet FDA standards. 

Further, on November 20, 2020, the HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The final rule would also eliminate the current safe harbor for Medicare drug rebates and create new safe harbors for beneficiary point-of-sale discounts and pharmacy benefit manager service fees. It originally was set to go into effect on January 1, 2022, but has been delayed by Congress to January 1, 2032. 

On August 16, 2022, the IRA was signed into law by President Biden. The new legislation has implications for Medicare Part D, which is a program available to individuals who are entitled to Medicare Part A or enrolled in Medicare Part B to give them the option of paying a monthly premium for outpatient prescription drug coverage. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), with prices that can be negotiated subject to a cap; imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2025); and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). The IRA permits the Secretary of the HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. 

Specifically, with respect to price negotiations, Congress authorized Medicare to negotiate lower prices for certain costly single-source drug and biologic products that do not have competing generics or biosimilars and are reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. The CMS may negotiate prices for ten high-cost drugs paid for by Medicare Part D starting in 2026, followed by 15 Part D drugs in 2027, 15 Part B or Part D drugs in 2028, and 20 Part B or Part D drugs in 2029 and beyond. This provision applies to drug products that have been approved for at least 9 years and biologics that have been licensed for 13 years, but it does not apply to drugs and biologics that have been approved for a single rare disease or condition. Nonetheless, since the CMS may establish a maximum price for these products in price negotiations, we would be fully at risk of government action if our products are the subject of Medicare price negotiations. Moreover, given the risk that could be the case, these provisions of the IRA may also further heighten the risk that we would not be able to achieve the expected return on our drug products or full value of our patents protecting our products if prices are set after such products have been on the market for nine years. 

Further, the legislation subjects drug manufacturers to civil monetary penalties and a potential excise tax for failing to comply with the legislation by offering a price that is not equal to or less than the negotiated &#8220;maximum fair price&#8221; under the law or for taking price increases that exceed inflation. The legislation also requires manufacturers to pay rebates for drugs in Medicare Part D whose price increases exceed inflation. The new law also caps Medicare out-of-pocket drug costs at an estimated $4,000 a year in 2024 and, thereafter beginning in 2025, at $2,000 a year. 

The first cycle of negotiations for the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program commenced in the summer of 2023. On August 15, 2024, the HHS published the results of the first Medicare drug price negotiations for ten selected drugs that treat a range of conditions, including diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. The prices of these ten drugs will become effective January 1, 2026. On January 17, 2025, the CMS announced its selection of 15 additional drugs covered by Part D for the second cycle of negotiations by February 1, 2025. While there had been some questions about the Trump Administration&#8217;s position on this program, the CMS issued a public statement on January 29, 2025, declaring that lowering the cost of prescription drugs is a top priority of the new administration and the CMS is committed to considering opportunities to bring greater transparency in the negotiation program. The second cycle of negotiations with participating drug companies will occur during 2025, and any negotiated prices for this second set of drugs will be effective starting January 1, 2027. 

On June 6, 2023, Merck &#38; Co. filed a lawsuit against the HHS and the CMS asserting that, among other things, the IRA&#8217;s Drug Price Negotiation Program for Medicare constitutes an uncompensated taking in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. Subsequently, a number of other parties, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (the &#8220;Chamber&#8221;), Bristol Myers Squibb Company, the PhRMA, Astellas, Novo Nordisk, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Novartis, AstraZeneca and Boehringer Ingelheim, also filed lawsuits in various courts with similar constitutional claims against the HHS and the CMS. There have been various decisions by the courts considering these cases since they were filed. The HHS has generally won the substantive disputes in these cases, and various federal district court judges have expressed skepticism regarding the merits of the legal arguments being pursued by the pharmaceutical industry. Certain of these cases are now on appeal and, on October 30, 2024, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit heard oral argument in three of these cases. We expect that litigation involving these and other provisions of the IRA will continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results. 

At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. This is increasingly true with respect to products approved pursuant to the accelerated approval pathway. State Medicaid programs and other payers are developing strategies and implementing significant coverage barriers, or refusing to cover these products outright, arguing that accelerated approval drugs have insufficient or limited evidence despite meeting the FDA&#8217;s standards for accelerated approval. In addition, regional health care organizations and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures. 

In addition, in some countries, including EU Member States, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take a significant amount of time after receipt of marketing approval for a product. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU Member States and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices, and in certain instances render commercialization in certain markets infeasible or disadvantageous from a financial perspective. In some countries, we or our collaborators may be required to conduct a clinical trial or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product and/or our product candidates to other available products in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. Publication of discounts by third party payors or government authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, the commercial launch of our product and/or product candidates could be delayed, possibly for lengthy periods of time, we or our collaborators may not launch at all in a particular country, we may not be able to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, and there could be a material adverse effect on our business. 

Our employees, principal investigators, consultants, and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading. 

We are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, principal investigators, consultants, and partners. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or the regulations applicable in the EU and other jurisdictions, provide accurate information to the FDA, the European Commission, and other regulatory authorities, comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, report financial information or data accurately, or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing, and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs, and other business arrangements. Such misconduct also could involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials or interactions with the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a code of conduct applicable to all of our employees, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from government investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions. 

Laws and regulations governing any international operations we may have in the future may preclude us from developing, manufacturing and selling certain product candidates outside of the United States and require us to develop and implement costly compliance programs. 

We are subject to numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction outside the United States in which we operate. The creation, implementation and maintenance of international business practices compliance programs is costly and such programs are difficult to enforce, particularly where reliance on third parties is required. 

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (&#8220;FCPA&#8221;) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. The anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA are enforced primarily by the Department of Justice. The SEC is involved with enforcement of the books and records provisions of the FCPA. 

Compliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions. 

Various laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. Our expansion outside of the United States has required, and will continue to require, us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain drugs and drug candidates outside of the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs. The failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial penalties, including suspension or debarment from government contracting. Violation of the FCPA can result in significant civil and criminal penalties. Indictment alone under the FCPA can lead to suspension of the right to do business with the U.S. government until the pending claims are resolved. Conviction of a violation of the FCPA can result in long-term disqualification as a government contractor. The termination of a government contract or relationship as a result of our failure to satisfy any of our obligations under laws governing international business practices would have a negative impact on our operations and harm our reputation and ability to procure government contracts. The 

SEC also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA&#8217;s accounting provisions. 

We are subject to stringent privacy laws, information security laws, regulations, policies and contractual obligations related to data privacy and security and changes in such laws, regulations, policies, contractual obligations and failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to significant fines and penalties, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

We are subject to data privacy and protection laws and regulations that apply to the collection, transmission, storage and use of personally-identifying information, which among other things, impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of personal information, including comprehensive regulatory systems in the U.S., EU and UK. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve in jurisdictions worldwide, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business. Failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could result in enforcement action against us, including fines, claims for damages by affected individuals, damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. 

There are numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal information. In particular, regulations promulgated pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;) establish privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, or protected health information, and require the implementation of administrative, physical and technological safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information and ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic protected health information. Determining whether protected health information has been handled in compliance with applicable privacy standards and our contractual obligations can be complex and may be subject to changing interpretation. These obligations may be applicable to some or all of our business activities now or in the future. 

If we fail to comply with applicable privacy laws, including applicable HIPAA privacy and security standards, we could face civil and criminal penalties. HHS enforcement activity can result in financial liability and reputational harm, and responses to such enforcement activity can consume significant internal resources. In recent months, the Officer of Civil Rights (&#8220;OCR&#8221;) has been especially active in enforcing the HIPAA rules. In addition, state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations that threaten the privacy of state residents. We cannot be sure how these regulations will be interpreted, enforced or applied to our operations. In addition to the risks associated with enforcement activities and potential contractual liabilities, our ongoing efforts to comply with evolving laws and regulations at the federal and state level may be costly and require ongoing modifications to our policies, procedures and systems. Additionally, the OCR is looking to amend the HIPAA Security Rule, which (if and when finalized) could create additional compliance obligations and risk for our business. 

In addition to potential enforcement by the HHS, we could also be potentially subject to privacy enforcement from the FTC. The FTC has been particularly focused on the unpermitted processing of health and genetic data through its recent enforcement actions and is expanding the types of privacy violations that it interprets to be &#8220;unfair&#8221; under Section 5 of the FTC Act, as well as the types of activities it views to trigger the Health Breach Notification Rule (which the FTC also has the authority to enforce). The agency is also in the process of developing rules related to commercial surveillance and data security. We will need to account for the FTC&#8217;s evolving rules and guidance for proper privacy and data security practices in order to mitigate risk for a potential enforcement action, which may be costly. Finally, both the FTC and HHS&#8217;s enforcement priorities (as well as those of other federal regulators) may be impacted by the change in administration and new leadership. These shifts in enforcement priorities may also impact our business. 

There are also increased restrictions at the federal level relating to transferring sensitive data outside of the U.S. to certain foreign countries. For example, in 2024, Congress passed H.B. 815, which included the Protecting Americans&#8217; Data from Foreign Adversaries Act of 2024. This law creates certain restrictions for entities that disclose sensitive data (including potential health data) to countries such as China. Failure to comply with these rules can lead to a potential FTC enforcement action. Additionally, the Department of Justice recently finalized a rule implementing Executive Order 14117, which creates similar restrictions related to the transfer of sensitive US data to countries such as China. These data transfer restrictions (and others that may pass in the future) may create operational challenges and legal risks for our business. In 2018, California passed into law the California Consumer Privacy Act (the &#8220;CCPA&#8221;), which took effect on January 1, 2020 and imposed many requirements on businesses that process the personal information of California residents. Many of the CCPA&#8217;s requirements are similar to those found in the General Data Protection Regulation (the &#8220;GDPR&#8221;), including requiring businesses to provide notice to data subjects regarding the information collected about them and how such 

information is used and shared, and providing data subjects the right to request access to such personal information and, in certain cases, request the erasure of such personal information. The CCPA also affords California residents the right to opt-out of &#8220;sales&#8221; of their personal information. The CCPA contains significant penalties for companies that violate its requirements. In November 2020, California voters passed a ballot initiative for the California Privacy Rights Act (the &#8220;CPRA&#8221;), which went into effect on January 1, 2023 and significantly expanded the CCPA to incorporate additional GDPR-like provisions including requiring that the use, retention, and sharing of personal information of California residents be reasonably necessary and proportionate to the purposes of collection or processing, granting additional protections for sensitive personal information, and requiring greater disclosures related to notice to residents regarding retention of information. The CPRA also created a new enforcement agency &#8211; the California Privacy Protection Agency &#8211; whose sole responsibility is to enforce the CPRA, which will further increase compliance risk. The provisions in the CPRA may apply to some of our business activities. 

In addition to California, at least eighteen other states have passed comprehensive privacy laws similar to the CCPA and CPRA. These laws are either in effect or will go into effect sometime before the end of 2026. Like the CCPA and CPRA, these laws create obligations related to the processing of personal information, as well as special obligations for the processing of &#8220;sensitive&#8221; data, which includes health data in some cases. Some of the provisions of these laws may apply to our business activities. There are also states that are strongly considering or have already passed comprehensive privacy laws during the 2024 legislative sessions that will go into effect in 2025 and beyond. Other states will be considering similar laws in the future, and Congress has also been debating passing a federal privacy law. There are also states that are specifically regulating health information that may affect our business. For example, the state of Washington passed the My Health My Data Act in 2023 which specifically regulated health information that is not otherwise regulated by the HIPAA rules, and the law also has a private right of action, which further increases the relevant compliance risk. Connecticut and Nevada have also passed similar laws regulating consumer health data, and more states are considering such legislation in 2024. These laws may impact our business activities, including our identification of research subjects, relationships with business partners and ultimately the marketing and distribution of our products. 

Plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers are also increasingly using privacy-related statutes at both the state and federal level to bring lawsuits against companies for their data-related practices. In particular, there have been a significant number of cases filed against companies for their use of pixels and other web trackers. These cases often allege violations of the California Invasion of Privacy Act and other state laws regulating wiretapping, as well as the federal Video Privacy Protection Act. The rise in these types of lawsuits creates potential risk for our business. 

Similar to the laws in the U.S., there are significant privacy and data security laws that apply in Europe and other countries. The collection, use, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data, including personal health data, regarding individuals who are located in the EEA, and the processing of personal data that takes place in the EEA, is regulated by the GDPR, which went into effect in May 2018 and which imposes obligations on companies that operate in our industry with respect to the processing of personal data and the cross-border transfer of such data. The GDPR imposes onerous accountability obligations requiring data controllers and processors to maintain a record of their data processing and policies. If our or our partners&#8217; or service providers&#8217; privacy or data security measures fail to comply with the GDPR requirements, we may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations, enforcement notices requiring us to change the way we use personal data and/or fines of up to 20 million Euros or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, as well as compensation claims by affected individuals, negative publicity, reputational harm and a potential loss of business and goodwill. 

The GDPR places restrictions on the cross-border transfer of personal data from the EU to countries that have not been found by the EC to offer adequate data protection legislation, such as the U.S. There are ongoing concerns about the ability of companies to transfer personal data from the EU to other countries. In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (the &#8220;CJEU&#8221;) invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, one of the mechanisms used to legitimize the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the U.S. The CJEU decision also drew into question the long-term viability of an alternative means of data transfer, the standard contractual clauses, for transfers of personal data from the EEA to the U.S. While we were not self-certified under the Privacy Shield, this CJEU decision may lead to increased scrutiny on data transfers from the EEA to the U.S. generally and increase our costs of compliance with data privacy legislation as well as our costs of negotiating appropriate privacy and security agreements with our vendors and business partners. 

In October 2022, President Biden signed an executive order to implement the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, which serves as a replacement to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. The EC adopted the adequacy decision on July 10, 2023. The adequacy decision permits U.S. companies who self-certify to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework to rely on it as a valid data transfer mechanism for data transfers from the EU to the U.S. However, some privacy advocacy groups have already 

suggested that they will be challenging the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. If these challenges are successful, they may not only impact the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, but also further limit the viability of the standard contractual clauses and other data transfer mechanisms. The uncertainty around this issue has the potential to impact our business. Following the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, the UK Data Protection Act 2018 applies to the processing of personal data that takes place in the UK and includes parallel obligations to those set forth by GDPR. In relation to data transfers, both the UK and the EU have determined, through separate &#8220;adequacy&#8221; decisions, that data transfers between the two jurisdictions are in compliance with the UK Data Protection Act and the GDPR, respectively. The UK and the U.S. have also agreed to a U.S.-UK &#8220;Data Bridge&#8221;, which functions similarly to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and provides an additional legal mechanism for companies to transfer data from the UK to the U.S. 

Following Brexit, there are open questions about how personal data will be protected in the U.K. and whether personal information can transfer from the EU to the U.K. Following the withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU, the U.K. Data Protection Act 2018 applies to the processing of personal data that takes place in the U.K. and includes parallel obligations to those set forth by GDPR. While the Data Protection Act of 2018 in the U.K. that &#8220;implements&#8221; and complements the GDPR has achieved Royal Assent on May 23, 2018 and is now effective in the U.K., it is unclear whether transfer of data from the EEA to the U.K. will remain lawful under the GDPR. The U.K. government has already determined that it considers all European Union 27 and EEA member states to be adequate for the purposes of data protection, ensuring that data flows from the U.K. to the EU/EEA remain unaffected. In addition, a recent decision from the European Commission appears to deem the U.K. as being &#8220;essentially adequate&#8221; for purposes of data transfer from the EU to the U.K., although this decision may be re-evaluated in the future. The UK and the United States also have agreed on a framework for personal data to be transferred between the UK and the United States, called the U.K.-U.S. Data Bridge. The U.K.-U.S. Data Bridge may be challenged in the future. 

Beyond GDPR, there are privacy and data security laws in a growing number of countries around the world. While many loosely follow GDPR as a model, other laws contain different or conflicting provisions. These laws will impact our ability to conduct our business activities, including both our clinical trials and the sale and distribution of commercial products, through increased compliance costs, costs associated with contracting and potential enforcement actions. 

While we continue to address the implications of the recent changes to data privacy regulations, data privacy remains an evolving landscape at both the domestic and international level, with new regulations coming into effect and continued legal challenges, and our efforts to comply with the evolving data protection rules may be unsuccessful. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. We must devote significant resources to understanding and complying with this changing landscape. Failure to comply with laws regarding data protection would expose us to risk of enforcement actions taken by data protection authorities in the EEA and elsewhere and carries with it the potential for significant penalties if we are found to be non-compliant. Similarly, failure to comply with federal and state laws in the U.S. regarding privacy and security of personal information could expose us to penalties under such laws. Any such failure to comply with data protection and privacy laws could result in government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our practices, claims for damages or other liabilities, regulatory investigations and enforcement action, litigation and significant costs for remediation, any of which could adversely affect our business. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. 

Risks Related to Employee Matters, Managing Growth, Public Health and Information Technology 

Our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain key executives and to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. 

We are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific teams. Each of these individuals is employed &#8220;at will,&#8221; meaning we or the individual may terminate the employment relationship at any time. We do not maintain &#8220;key person&#8221; insurance for any of our executives or other employees. The loss of the services of any of these persons could impede the achievement of our research, development, and commercialization objectives. 

Recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing, and sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we 

rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. In addition, our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could be impacted by other factors, such as remote or hybrid working arrangements, which could impact employees&#8217; productivity and morale, as well as any failure to succeed in preclinical or clinical trials. The inability to recruit or the loss of the services of any executive, key employee, consultant or advisor may impede the progress of our research, development and commercialization objectives. 

We face risks related to health epidemics, pandemics and other widespread outbreaks of contagious disease, which could significantly disrupt our operations, impact our financial results or otherwise adversely impact our business. 

Significant outbreaks of contagious diseases, and other adverse public health developments, could have a material impact on our business operations and operating results. Any public health crises or related healthcare staffing shortages, supply chain restrictions, or other issues, may result in disruptions that could adversely impact our operations, research and development, including preclinical studies, clinical trials and manufacturing activities, including: 

&#8226; delays or disruptions in clinical trials that we may be conducting, including patient screening, patient enrollment, patient dosing, clinical trial site activation, and study monitoring; 

&#8226; delays or disruptions in preclinical experiments and IND- and clinical trial application-enabling studies due to restrictions related to our staff being on site; 

&#8226; interruption or delays in the operations of the FDA, EMA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies; 

&#8226; interruption of, or delays in, receiving, supplies of drug substance and drug product from our CMOs or delays or disruptions in our pre-clinical experiments or clinical trials performed by CROs due to staffing shortages, production and research slowdowns or stoppages and disruptions in delivery systems or research; 

&#8226; limitations imposed on our business operations by local, state, or federal authorities to address such pandemics or similar public health crises could impact our ability to conduct preclinical or clinical activities, including conducting IND- and clinical trial application-enabling studies or our ability to select future development candidates; and 

&#8226; business disruptions caused by potential workplace, laboratory and office closures and an increased reliance on employees working from home, disruptions to or delays in ongoing laboratory experiments and operations, staffing shortages, travel limitations, cyber security and data accessibility, or communication or mass transit disruptions, any of which could adversely impact our business operations or delay necessary interactions with local regulators, ethics committees, manufacturing sites, research or clinical trial sites and other important agencies and contractors. 

Timely completion of preclinical activities and initiation of planned clinical trials for product candidates is dependent upon the availability of, for example, preclinical and clinical trial sites, researchers and investigators, regulatory agency personnel, and materials, which may be adversely affected by a public health crisis and related government responses . 

We cannot presently predict the scope and severity of any potential business shutdowns or disruptions. If we or any of the third parties with whom we engage, however, were to experience shutdowns or other business disruptions, our ability to conduct our business in the manner and on the timelines presently planned could be materially and negatively affected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and our results of operation and financial condition. 

Security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology structure could compromise our information, disrupt our business and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer. 

In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, process and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, as well as our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers and business partners, employee data, and we may collect personally identifiable information of clinical trial participants in connection with clinical trials. We also rely to a large extent on information technology systems to operate our business, including our financial systems. We have outsourced elements of our confidential information processing and information technology structure, and as a result, we 

are managing independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information. Similarly, our business partners and other third-party providers possess certain elements of our sensitive data. The secure maintenance of this information is important to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology infrastructure (and those of our partners, vendors and third-party providers) may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. We, our partners, vendors, and other third-party providers could be susceptible to third party attacks on our, and their, information security systems, which attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise, including organized criminal groups, hacktivists, nation states and others. We have implemented a hybrid work model, which may place our information technology infrastructure and data at increased risk as more of our employees work from home utilizing network connections outside our premises. Additionally, sensitive data could be leaked, disclosed, or revealed as a result of or in connection with our employees&#8217;, vendors&#8217; or partners&#8217; use of generative AI technologies. We have invested in information technology security measures and the protection of confidential and sensitive information, but there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent system failures, accidents or security breaches. While we believe we have not experienced any such material system failure, accident or security breach to date, any such event may substantially impair our ability to operate our business and would compromise our, and their, networks and the information stored could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. In addition, if a ransomware attack or other cybersecurity incident occurs, either internally or at our vendors or third-party technology service providers, we could be prevented from accessing our data or systems, which may cause interruptions or delays in our business operations, cause us to incur remediation costs, subject us to demands to pay a ransom, or damage our reputation, regardless of whether we pay the ransom amount. Any such event, or other loss of information, could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business. 

Although we have general liability and cybersecurity insurance coverage, our insurance may not cover all claims, continue to be available on reasonable terms or be sufficient in amount to compensate us fully for potential significant losses; additionally, the insurer may disclaim coverage as to any claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed or are not covered by our insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 

Risks Related to Our Common Stock 

The market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to remain, volatile. 

Our stock price has been, and is likely to remain, volatile. For example, since January 1, 2023, the trading price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market has ranged from a low of $1.12 to a high of $11.93 through January 31, 2025. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include: 

&#8226; the success of existing or new competitive products or technologies; 

&#8226; the timing and results of our preclinical studies for any product candidates that we develop; 

&#8226; commencement or termination of collaborations for our product development and research programs; 

&#8226; failure or discontinuation of any of our product development and research programs; 

&#8226; results of preclinical studies, clinical trials, or regulatory approvals of product candidates of our competitors, or announcements about new research programs or product candidates of our competitors; 

&#8226; developments or changing views regarding the use of genomic medicines, including those that involve genome editing; 

&#8226; regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries; 

&#8226; developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents, or other proprietary rights; 

&#8226; the recruitment or departure of key personnel; 

&#8226; the level of expenses related to any of our research programs, clinical development programs, or product candidates that we develop; 

&#8226; the results of our efforts to develop additional product candidates or products; 

&#8226; actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines, or recommendations by securities analysts; 

&#8226; announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts; 

&#8226; sales of our common stock by us, our insiders, or other stockholders; 

&#8226; variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us; 

&#8226; changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if any, that cover our stock; 

&#8226; changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems; 

&#8226; market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors; 

&#8226; general economic, industry, and market conditions; and 

&#8226; the other factors described in this &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section. 

The stock market in general, and the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in the operating performance of the companies whose stock is experiencing those price and volume fluctuations. Because of the potential volatility of our stock price, we may become the target of securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management&#8217;s attention and resources from our business. 

If securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they publish negative evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock and trading volume could decline. 

The trading market for our common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts covering our business downgrade their evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover our stock or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the market for our stock, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. 

Future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall. 

We will need additional capital in the future to continue our planned operations. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. These sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders. 

In addition, sales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares of common stock intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. 

We have registered substantially all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance and once vested, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates. If any of these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline. 

We incur costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices. 

As a public company we incur, and will continue to incur, significant legal, accounting, and other expenses. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Global Select Market, and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time towards maintaining compliance with these requirements. These requirements increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. 

We have broad discretion in the use of our cash reserves and may not use them effectively, including that we may be exposed to liquidity issues and other systemic financial risks at the financial institutions holding our cash and cash equivalents. 

Our management has broad discretion to use our cash reserves and could use our cash reserves in ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our common stock. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could result in financial losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, cause the price of our common stock to decline, and delay the development of our product candidates. Pending their use, we may invest our cash reserves in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value. 

A portion of our cash may be held by financial institutions that may have been, or could in the future become, exposed to liquidity issues, bank failures or other systemic financial risks. Our uninsured cash deposits with such financial institutions may be at risk in the event they experience liquidity problems or other financial losses. We assess our banking relationships as we believe necessary or appropriate, but our business, our business partners, or industry as a whole may be adversely impacted in ways that we cannot predict at this time, including our ability to access cash in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our current and/or projected business operations could be significantly impaired by factors that affect the financial institutions with which we have banking relationships, and in turn, us. These factors could include, among others, events such as liquidity constraints or failures, the ability to perform obligations under various types of financial, credit or liquidity agreements or arrangements (including cash management arrangements), disruptions or instability in the financial services industry or financial markets, or concerns or negative expectations about the prospects for companies in the financial services industry. In addition, our vendors, such as our CMOs, CROs or business partners, may be susceptible to the foregoing liquidity or other financial risks and factors, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our current and/or projected business operations and results of operations and financial condition. 

We do not expect to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, stockholders must rely on capital appreciation, if any, for any return on their investments. 

We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be stockholders&#8217; sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. 

Provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law might discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock. 

Provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, acquisition, or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our common stock. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions include: 

&#8226; limitations on the removal of directors; 

&#8226; a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time; 

&#8226; advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations; 

&#8226; the inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings; 

&#8226; the requirement that at least 75% of the votes cast by all our stockholders approve the amendment or repeal of certain provisions of our amended and restated bylaws or restated certificate of incorporation; 

&#8226; the ability of our board of directors to make, alter, or repeal our amended and restated bylaws; and 

&#8226; the ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a rights plan, or a poison pill, that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors. 

In addition, Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. 

The existence of the foregoing provisions could deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that our stockholders could receive a premium for their shares of common stock in an acquisition. 

Our restated certificate of incorporation designates the state courts in the State of Delaware or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against the company and our directors and officers. 

Our restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless our board of directors otherwise determines, the state courts in the State of Delaware or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to our company or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. This exclusive forum provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act of 1934, which provides for exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts. It could apply, however, to a suit that falls within one or more of the categories enumerated in the exclusive forum provision and asserts claims under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;) , inasmuch as Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder; provided, that with respect to claims under the Securities Act, our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. 

We are a &#8220;smaller reporting company&#8221; within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and if we decide to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies, our common stock could be less attractive to investors. 

For so long as we qualify as a &#8220;smaller reporting company,&#8221; we will have the option to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting and other requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not &#8220;smaller reporting companies,&#8221; including but not limited to reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and later effective dates for compliance with certain new disclosure obligations. In addition, for as long as we are deemed neither a large accelerated filer nor an accelerated filer, we will continue to use the exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We will remain a smaller reporting company if we have either (i) a public float of less than $250 million held by non-affiliates as of the last business day of the second quarter of our then-current fiscal year or (ii) annual revenues of less than $100 million during such recently completed fiscal year with less than $700 million in public float as of the last business day of the second quarter of such fiscal year. 

In the event we are eligible to and do rely on the exemptions available to smaller reporting companies, we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may or do rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.

You should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in evaluating our company and our common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Risks Related to Our Properties and Business 

If global market and economic conditions deteriorate, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 

Weak economic conditions generally, sustained uncertainty about global economic conditions, a tightening of credit markets, business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns and other similar factors that affect our tenants have negatively impacted commercial real estate fundamentals and may continue to do so, which has resulted and may continue to result in lower occupancy, lower rental rates and declining values in our real estate portfolio. Additionally, these factors and conditions have had and may continue to have an impact on our lenders or tenants, which could cause them to reduce their business with us or fail to meet their obligations to us. We are subject to the risk of rising interest rates, including that our borrowing costs may increase and we may be unable to extend or refinance our debt obligations on favorable terms or at all. We are also subject to the risk of inflation, including that our operating costs, such as insurance premiums, utilities, real estate taxes and capital expenditures and repair and maintenance costs, may rise. We also may be unable to offset any increases in our borrowing costs or operating costs by increases in our rental revenues which are generally fixed. No assurances can be given regarding such macroeconomic factors or conditions, and our ability to lease our properties and increase or maintain rental rates or the profitability of our properties may be negatively impacted, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Changes in workplace practices and office space utilization, including remote and hybrid work arrangements, have reduced the demand for office space at our properties and may continue to do so. 

Changes in workplace practices and office space utilization, including remote and hybrid work arrangements, have negatively impacted our company and these factors may continue and worsen. For example, the increased adoption of and 

familiarity with remote and hybrid work practices has resulted in decreased demand for and utilization of office space. These trends have impacted our leasing efforts as certain of our tenants have elected to not renew their leases, or to renew them for less space than they were occupying, resulting in increases in vacancy rates at our properties and decreases in rental income. Remote and hybrid work practices may continue to persist, which may cause the trends impacting our leasing efforts to continue or even accelerate. Tenants&#8217; evolving preferences regarding office space configuration either in response to the COVID-19 pandemic or for other reasons, may impact their space requirements and also has required and may continue to require us to spend increased amounts for tenant improvements. If substantial office space reconfiguration is required, a tenant may explore other office space and find it more advantageous to relocate than to renew its lease and renovate the existing space. Less successful leasing efforts, lower rents and increased leasing costs have caused our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects to be materially adversely impacted, and may continue to do so. 

Leases representing approximately 13.5% of our annualized base rent are scheduled to expire in 2025 and we could experience difficulties or delays renewing leases or re-leasing vacant space, which will increase our costs to operate and maintain such properties without receiving income. 

We derive nearly all of our net income from rent received from our tenants, and our profitability is significantly dependent upon our ability to minimize vacancies in our properties and ensure our tenants timely pay rent at an attractive rate. If a tenant experiences a downturn in its business or other types of financial distress, it may be unable to make timely rental payments. If lease defaults occur, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as landlord. Leases representing approximately 13.5% of our annualized base rent are scheduled to expire in 2025, and as of December 31, 2024, our portfolio, including our proportionate share of properties owned by the Arch Street Joint Venture, had a weighted average lease term of 5.2 years, and had 11 vacant operating properties, with an aggregate 1.7 million square feet, including six properties, with an aggregate of 0.6 million square feet, that have remained vacant for over one year. If our tenants decide not to renew their leases, terminate their leases early or default on their leases, we will experience a loss in the associated rental revenue and will incur property operating costs that will no longer be reimbursed by the vacating tenant. When tenant leases expire, we confirm the condition of the premises and will seek to enforce the performance of any outstanding tenant obligations, such as repair and maintenance and lease surrender obligations. These efforts can lead to disputes with the tenants, and we cannot provide any assurance we will be successful in enforcing the tenant&#8217;s obligations. Accordingly, we may incur enforcement and property operating and capital costs in connection with expired leases that may not be recoverable. Tenant lease expirations, delays in re-leasing vacant space and tenant defaults could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay dividends to stockholders. 

Most of our properties depend upon a single tenant for all or a majority of their rental income; therefore, our financial condition, including our ability to make distributions to stockholders, may be adversely affected by the bankruptcy or insolvency, a downturn in the business, or a lease termination of such a single tenant. 

During the year ended December 31, 2024, most of our rental revenue was from our properties leased to single tenants. The value of our single tenant properties is materially dependent on the performance of those tenants under their respective leases. These tenants face competition within their industries and other factors that could reduce their ability to pay us rent. Lease payment defaults by such tenants could cause us to reduce the amount of distributions that we pay to our stockholders. A default by a single or major tenant, the failure of a guarantor to fulfill its obligations or premature termination of a lease to such a tenant or such tenant&#8217;s election not to extend a lease upon its expiration could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. 

We expect to continue to convert certain vacant properties to multi-tenant use, and cannot provide any assurance that the investments we make of time and capital to do so will increase the value of the subject properties. 

Where we determine it will maximize the value of the subject property, we have converted certain vacant properties to multi-tenant use and expect we will continue to do so. Our multi-tenant properties are subject to a variety of risks not typically encountered in real estate properties that are operated by or for a single tenant, which could materially adversely affect the value of our investment, including: 

&#8226; conversion to multi-tenant use will require us to make significant investment in the subject property, such as to create common areas, separate building systems, construct new demising walls and corridors and install restrooms and access points; 

&#8226; in order to attract high quality anchor tenants, we may be required to install and guarantee the full operation of significant amenities like cafeterias and gyms and the cost to operate these amenities may not be recoverable particularly if the building is not fully occupied; and 

&#8226; multi-tenant properties generally require greater landlord responsibility to manage and operate the properties and bear the associated costs, which will place added burden on our property management team and will result in costs that may not be recoverable from the tenants. 

We may incur costs to convert properties to multi-tenant use and to operate multi-tenant properties that may not be recoverable and we cannot provide any assurance that our decision to convert properties to multi-tenant will increase the value of the subject properties. 

Government budgetary pressures and priorities, and trends in government employment and office leasing may adversely impact our business. 

We believe that recent government budgetary and spending priorities and enhancements in technology have resulted in a decrease in government office use for employees. Furthermore, over the past several years, government tenants have reduced their space utilization per employee and consolidated government tenants into existing government owned properties. Persistent remote and hybrid work practices have also reduced space utilization at many of our government properties. These factors have reduced the demand for government leased space, and may continue to do so. The Trump Administration&#8217;s initiative to dramatically cut government spending introduces additional uncertainty for our portfolio of properties leased to the United States Government. The Department of Government Efficiency (&#8220;DOGE&#8221;) has begun to look at ways to increase government office utilization and shrink the federal government&#8217;s real estate portfolio. This could lead to the General Services Administration (&#8220;GSA&#8221;) exercising termination options under or otherwise seeking to terminate our leases with the United States Government or make it more likely the United States Government terminates the applicable lease at lease expiration. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 94,000 of our occupied square feet leased to the GSA were within periods during which the tenant has the right to terminate their space without a termination fee, or &#8220;non-firm terms.&#8221; The GSA recently announced a suspension of the execution of substantially all GSA funded obligations, including new leases and lease amendments. This action by the GSA has resulted in delays of the GSA authorizing us to proceed with landlord work at our property in Lincoln, Nebraska and that is a condition to lease commencement of our lease with the United States Government at this property, as well as delays in lease negotiations at certain other properties leased to the United States Government. We do not know how long the suspension will continue and cannot provide any assurance as to how ongoing developments with respect to DOGE and the Trump Administration&#8217;s efforts to reduce government spending may impact our portfolio of properties leased to the United States Government. Efforts to manage space utilization rates and reduce government spending may result in the government tenants exercising early termination rights under our leases, vacating our properties upon expiration of our leases in order to relocate, or renewing their leases for less space than they currently occupy. Also, our government tenants&#8217; desire to reconfigure leased office space to manage utilization per employee may require us to spend significant amounts for tenant improvements, and tenant relocations are often more prevalent in those circumstances. Compared to our historical experience with government tenants, the government tenants&#8217; leasing decisions and strategies may be less predictable. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath have had negative impacts on government budgets and resources, and it is unclear what the effect of these impacts will be on government demand for leasing office space. 

Our partner in the Arch Street Joint Venture has not had access to sufficient liquidity to contribute its share of the capital requirements that have recently arisen, thereby exposing us to liabilities in excess of our share of the joint venture and other risks. 

We are invested in the Arch Street Joint Venture where we own a 20% minority, non-controlling interest and our partner owns the remaining 80% interest. Our partner in the Arch Street Joint Venture did not have access to sufficient liquidity to contribute its share of capital call obligations that have recently arisen, and this issue may continue to the extent additional partner capital is required in the future. During November 2024, our joint venture partner was unable to contribute its proportionate share of the capital required to pay down $3.4 million of principal on the Arch Street Joint Venture non-recourse mortgage notes to satisfy the 60% loan-to-value condition to extend the maturity date of such debt. As a result, we made a member loan to the Arch Street Joint Venture in the amount of $1.4 million. As of December 31, 2024, the outstanding principal associated with the Arch Street Joint Venture mortgage notes was $131.6 million, and our proportionate share was $26.3 million. During February 2025, we made an additional member loan of $8.3 million when our partner was unable to contribute its share of leasing costs related to a lease extension that was completed for one of the properties in the Arch Street Joint Venture portfolio. As part of the terms of the recent extension of the Arch Street Joint Venture mortgage notes, the mortgage lender is expected to re-appraise the property where the lease was extended in February 2025, and we are also committed to make an additional member loan as and if needed to repay principal on the mortgage notes to continue to satisfy the 60% loan-to-value extension condition. Our member loan to the Arch Street Joint Venture, which had $9.2 million receivable as of March 5, 2025, earns interest at 15% per annum and is non-recourse and unsecured, and structurally subordinate to the Arch Street Joint Venture mortgage notes. Interest and principal are payable monthly solely out of the excess 

cash from the joint venture after payment of property operating expenses, interest and principal on the Arch Street mortgage notes and other joint venture expenses and excess proceeds from the sale of any of the joint venture properties. Our partner&#8217;s failure to meet capital call obligations exposes us to certain risks, including: 

&#8226; we may have insufficient liquidity or decide it is no longer in our best interest to continue to make member loan or other investments to fund the joint venture&#8217;s capital requirements, which could expose us to loss of all or substantially all of our investment in the joint venture; 

&#8226; we may be unable to recover our member loan or other investments in the joint venture in a timely manner or at all; and 

&#8226; the investments we have recently made or may make in the future in the joint venture reduce our available liquidity and therefore may limit our ability to grow or make other investments in our portfolio. 

The Arch Street Joint Venture and any other joint venture investments we make could be adversely affected by the lack of sole decision-making authority, reliance on joint venture partners&#8217; financial condition and any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners. 

We are invested in the Arch Street Joint Venture and have co-invested and may in the future co-invest with third parties through partnerships, joint ventures or other structures in which we acquire non-controlling interests in, or share responsibility for, managing the affairs of a property, partnership, co-tenancy or other entity. Our ability to determine the strategy with respect to properties we own through the Arch Street Joint Venture is materially limited compared to acquisitions we make directly, including with respect to leasing, disposition and joint venture opportunities (including if such actions are necessary to maintain compliance with our debt commitments). 

We also may enter into future joint ventures pursuant to which we will not be able to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the properties owned through such joint ventures or similar ownership structure. In addition, investments in joint ventures may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present when a third party is not involved, including potential deadlocks in making major decisions, restrictions on our ability to exit the joint venture, reliance on joint venture partners and the possibility that a joint venture partner might become bankrupt or fail to fund its share of required capital contributions, thus exposing us to liabilities in excess of our share of the joint venture or jeopardizing our REIT status. The funding of our capital contributions to such joint ventures may be dependent on proceeds from the sale of real estate assets, credit facility advances or sales of equity securities. Joint venture partners, including Arch Street Capital Partners, may have business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our best interests. We may, in specific circumstances, be liable for the actions of our joint venture partners. In addition, any disputes that may arise between us and joint venture partners, including Arch Street Capital Partners, may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The United States Government&#8217;s &#8220;green lease&#8221; policies may adversely affect us. 

In recent years, the United States Government has instituted &#8220;green lease&#8221; policies which allow a government tenant to require Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design for commercial interiors, or LEED &#174; -CI, designation in selecting new premises or renewing leases at existing premises, and these policies have and may continue to be expanded to cover additional enhanced requirements. In addition, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 allows the United States Government to give preference to buildings for lease that have received an &#8220;Energy Star&#8221; label. Complying with enhanced requirements may be costly and time consuming, but our failure to do so may result in our competitive disadvantage in acquiring new or retaining existing government tenants. 

We may be unable to successfully execute on our strategy to shift our portfolio concentration over time away from traditional office properties, towards more dedicated use assets. 

As part of our investment strategy, we intend to shift our portfolio concentration over time away from traditional office properties, towards more dedicated use assets that have an office component. We believe that by doing so we will increase that value of our portfolio, as it is our experience that dedicated use assets have greater tenant utilization and higher renewal probability. As of December 31, 2024, our portfolio was comprised of 75.0% and 68.2% traditional office properties, calculated based on rentable square feet and annualized base rent, respectively. In order to increase the percentage of dedicated use assets in our portfolio, we will need to acquire additional dedicated use assets and/or dispose of traditional office properties. Our ability to acquire new properties and dispose of existing properties in our portfolio is dependent upon competitive and market conditions, which may not be favorable to us at any given time, as well as other factors outside of our control. We may not be 

successful in executing our strategy of shifting our portfolio concentration over time towards more dedicated use assets, and whether or not we are successful in executing such strategy, we may not achieve our objective of increasing the value of our portfolio. 

Competition for acquisitions may reduce the number of acquisition opportunities available to us and increase the costs of those acquisitions. 

We may acquire properties if market conditions permit and we are presented with an attractive opportunity to do so. We may face competition for such acquisition opportunities from other investors, and such competition may adversely affect us by subjecting us to the following risks: 

&#8226; an inability to acquire a desired property because of competition from other well-capitalized real estate investors, including publicly traded and privately held REITs, private real estate funds, domestic and foreign financial institutions, life insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, pension trusts, partnerships and individual investors; 

&#8226; we may incur costs on unsuccessful acquisitions that we will not be able to recover; and 

&#8226; an increase in the purchase price for such acquisition property in the event we are able to acquire such desired property. 

Accordingly, competition for acquisitions may limit our opportunities to grow our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We may suffer adverse effects from acquisitions of commercial real estate properties. 

We intend to pursue acquisitions of additional commercial real estate properties as part of our business strategy. Acquisitions of commercial properties entail risks, such as the risk that we may not be in a position, or have the opportunity in the future, to make suitable property acquisitions on advantageous terms and/or that such acquisitions fail to perform as expected. 

We may pursue selective acquisitions of properties in regions where we have not previously owned properties. These acquisitions may entail risks in addition to those we face with acquisitions in more familiar regions, such as our not sufficiently anticipating conditions or trends in a new market and therefore not being able to operate the acquired property profitably. 

In addition, we may acquire properties that are subject to liabilities in situations where we have no recourse, or only limited recourse, against the prior owners or other third parties with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it. Examples of unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties include, but are not limited to: 

&#8226; liabilities for remediation of disclosed or undisclosed environmental contamination; 

&#8226; claims by tenants, vendors or other persons dealing with the former owners of the properties; 

&#8226; liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business; and 

&#8226; claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties. 

Our performance is subject to risks inherent in owning real estate investments. 

We are generally subject to risks incidental to the ownership of real estate. These risks include: 

&#8226; changes in supply of or demand for office properties in our market or sub-markets; 

&#8226; competition for tenants in our market or sub-markets; 

&#8226; the ongoing need for capital improvements; 

&#8226; increased operating costs, which may not necessarily be offset by increased rents, including insurance premiums, utilities, real estate taxes, capital expenditures and repair and maintenance costs, due to inflation and other factors; 

&#8226; changes in tax, real estate and zoning laws; 

&#8226; changes in governmental rules and fiscal policies; 

&#8226; inability of tenants to pay rent; 

&#8226; competition from the development of new space in our market or sub-markets and the quality of competition, such as the attractiveness of our properties as compared to our competitors&#8217; properties based on considerations such as convenience of location, rental rates, amenities and safety record; and 

&#8226; civil unrest, acts of war, terrorism, adverse political conditions, acts of God, including earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters (which may result in uninsured losses) and other factors beyond our control. 

Should any of the foregoing occur, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We face considerable competition in the leasing market and may be unable to renew existing leases or re-let space on terms similar to our existing leases, or we may expend significant capital in our efforts to re-lease space, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We compete with a number of other owners and operators of office properties to renew leases with our existing tenants and to attract new tenants. If our properties are not as attractive to existing or new tenants as properties owned by our competitors due to the age of the buildings, physical condition, lack of amenities or other similar factors, we could lose tenants, it could take longer to re-lease our properties and we could suffer lower rental rates. To the extent that we are able to renew leases that are scheduled to expire in the short-term or re-let such space to new tenants, heightened competition may require us to give rent concessions or provide tenant improvements to a greater extent than we otherwise would have. 

If our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, we may lose potential tenants, and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge, or may not be able to increase rates to market rates, in order to retain tenants upon expiration of their existing leases. Even if our tenants renew their leases or we can re-let the space, the terms and other costs of renewal or re-letting, including the cost of required renovations, increased tenant improvement allowances, leasing commissions, declining rental rates, and rent or other potential concessions, may be less favorable than the terms of our current leases and could require significant capital expenditures. Our inability to renew leases or re-let space in a reasonable time, a decline in rental rates or an increase in tenant improvement allowances, leasing commissions, rent concessions or other costs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Tenant payment defaults may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Nearly all of our revenues and income comes from rental income from real property. As such, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if our tenants default on their lease payment obligations. Our ability to manage our assets is also subject to federal bankruptcy laws and state laws that limit creditors&#8217; rights and remedies available to real property owners to collect delinquent rents. If a tenant becomes insolvent or bankrupt, we cannot be sure that we could recover the premises from the tenant promptly or from a trustee or debtor-in-possession in any bankruptcy proceeding relating to that tenant. We also cannot be sure that we would receive any rent in the proceeding sufficient to cover our expenses with respect to the premises. If a tenant becomes bankrupt, the federal bankruptcy code will apply and, in some instances, may restrict the amount and recoverability of our claims against the tenant. A tenant&#8217;s default on its payment obligations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Some of our leases provide tenants with the right to terminate their leases early, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Certain of our leases permit our tenants to terminate their leases as to all or a portion of their leased premises prior to their stated lease expiration dates under certain circumstances, such as providing notice by a certain date and, in most cases, paying a termination fee. As of December 31, 2024, 11.2% of our occupied square footage was subject to early termination provisions. During the year ended December 31, 2024, one tenant exercised an early termination option which will result in the partial termination of approximately 30,000 square feet under an approximately 127,000 square foot lease in the year ending December 31, 2025. During the year ended December 31, 2023, one tenant exercised an early termination option, which resulted in the partial termination of approximately 30,000 square feet under an approximately 200,000 square foot lease in the year ended December 31, 2023. To the extent that our tenants exercise early termination rights, our cash flow and earnings will be adversely affected, and we can provide no assurances that we will be able to generate an equivalent amount of net effective rent by leasing the vacated space to new third-party tenants. If our tenants elect to terminate their leases early, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We have a significant amount of indebtedness and may need to incur more in the future. 

As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $492.0 million of total outstanding consolidated indebtedness. In addition, in connection with executing our business strategies going forward, we expect to invest in our current portfolio and, as market conditions permit, intend to acquire additional properties and make strategic investments, and we may elect to finance these endeavors by incurring additional indebtedness. The amount of such indebtedness could have material adverse consequences for us, including: 

&#8226; hindering our ability to adjust to changing market, industry or economic conditions; 

&#8226; limiting our ability to access the capital markets to raise additional equity or refinance maturing debt on favorable terms to fund acquisitions, respond to competitive challenges or otherwise execute our business strategy; 

&#8226; limiting the amount of free cash flow available for future operations, reinvestment in our portfolio, acquisitions, dividends or other uses; 

&#8226; making us more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns, including interest rate increases; and 

&#8226; placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors. 

Our ability to arrange additional financing will depend on, among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. If we are able to obtain additional financing, such financing could further raise our borrowing costs and adversely impact our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

In addition, our charter and bylaws do not limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur. Accordingly, our Board of Directors may permit us to incur additional debt and would do so, for example, if it were necessary to maintain our status as a REIT. We might become more highly leveraged as a result, and our financial condition, results of operations and funds available for distribution to stockholders might be negatively affected, and the risk of default on our indebtedness could increase, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We have existing debt and refinancing risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including the risk that we will be unable to extend or refinance some or all of our debt. 

We have both fixed and variable rate indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including borrowings under our Revolving Facility. Our Revolving Facility under which we had $119.0 million borrowed as of December 31, 2024 is scheduled to mature in May 2026, and our $355.0 million CMBS Loan is scheduled to mature in February 2027. We are dependent upon the Revolving Facility, which is a fully recourse borrowing facility guaranteed in full by us, for liquidity to execute our business strategies, and our CMBS Loan provides cross-collateralized financing for a total of 19 properties in our portfolio, and therefore the lender will have recourse to any and all of the assets that secure the debt in the event we default. We cannot provide assurance we will be able to extend, refinance or repay these debt obligations at maturity. Our ability to extend or refinance debt will be affected by our financial condition and various other factors existing at the relevant time, including factors beyond our control, such as capital and credit market conditions, the state of the national and regional economies, local real estate conditions and the equity in and value of the related collateral. We may be required to make significant principal repayments to extend or refinance our debt obligations. 

Following the Arch Street Joint Venture&#8217;s exercise of the first extension option and satisfaction of the related conditions in November 2024, the non-recourse mortgage notes associated with the Arch Street Joint Venture of $131.6 million as of December 31, 2024 are scheduled to mature on November 27, 2025, and the Arch Street Joint Venture has one remaining one-year option to extend the maturity until November 27, 2026. Our proportionate share of the mortgage notes was $26.3 million as of December 31, 2024. The extension option is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including satisfaction of certain financial and operating covenants. The Arch Street Joint Venture may be unable to satisfy the extension conditions, and we cannot provide any assurance the Arch Street Joint Venture will be able to satisfy the extension conditions or otherwise extend or refinance the mortgage notes. If the Arch Street Joint Venture is unable to extend or refinance the mortgage notes, our investment in the Arch Street Joint Venture could be materially adversely affected. 

As a result of the indebtedness we incur, we are, and expect to be, subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing including: 

&#8226; that we will be unable to extend, refinance or repay our debt as it becomes due or increase the availability of overall debt on terms as favorable as those of our existing debt, or at all; 

&#8226; that interest rates may rise; 

&#8226; that our cash flow could be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest; 

&#8226; that required payments on mortgages and on our other debt are not reduced if the economic performance of any property declines; 

&#8226; that debt service obligations will reduce funds available for distribution to our stockholders; 

&#8226; that any default on our debt, due to noncompliance with financial covenants or otherwise, could result in acceleration of those obligations; 

&#8226; that we may be unable to extend, refinance or repay the debt as it becomes due; and 

&#8226; that if our degree of leverage is viewed unfavorably by lenders or potential joint venture partners, it could affect our ability to obtain additional financing. 

If we are unable to extend, refinance or repay our indebtedness as it becomes due, we may need to sell assets or to seek protection from our creditors under applicable law, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Financial covenants could materially adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. 

We have incurred debt pursuant to the Revolving Facility and the CMBS Loan. The credit agreement governing the Revolving Facility and the CMBS Loan each contain various financial and other covenants, including, with respect to the Revolving Facility, various financial covenants and other covenants restricting, subject to certain exceptions, liens, investments, mergers, asset sales, and the payment of certain dividends and share repurchases. The financial covenants under the Revolving Facility are discussed in the section in this report entitled &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition &#8211; Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8211; Credit Agreements &#8211; Revolving Facility Covenants&#8221;. The CMBS Loan includes a minimum debt yield test of 8.0%. Failure to satisfy this test, although not an event of default under the indebtedness, could cause cash flows from the 19 properties financed, after debt service, and certain property operating expenses and loan reserves, to be diverted to the lender, as additional collateral until the minimum debt yield test has been satisfied. Under the CMBS Loan agreement, we are permitted to prepay outstanding principal under the indebtedness to satisfy the debt yield test. As of September 30, 2024 (most recent reporting period available and confirmed with lender) the minimum debt yield was satisfied. Our ability to continue to meet the debt yield test will be dependent upon whether leases that are scheduled to expire in the collateral pool are extended and if they do not the pace at which we re-lease the properties following lease expiration. We cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to satisfy the minimum debt yield test under the CMBS Loan through maturity of the indebtedness in February 2027, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. 

The financial and other covenants under our existing indebtedness, as well as any additional restrictions to which we may become subject in connection with additional financings or refinancings, could restrict our ability to pursue business initiatives, effect certain transactions or make other changes to our business that may otherwise be beneficial to us, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, violations of these covenants could cause declarations of default under, and acceleration of, any related indebtedness, which would result in material adverse consequences to our financial condition. The Revolving Facility contains cross-default provisions that give the lenders the right to declare a default if we are in default resulting in (or permitting the) acceleration of other debt under other loans in excess of certain amounts. In the event of a default, we may be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources, which may not be available to us on attractive terms, or at all, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We depend on external sources of capital that are outside of our control, which may affect our ability to achieve our business strategies. 

We will be required to make significant capital investments in our existing portfolio, including tenant improvement allowances to attract and retain tenants, as well as normal building improvements to replace obsolete building components. As market conditions permit, we intend to acquire new properties which will similarly require us to make capital investments. We do not expect our cash flows from operations alone to be sufficient to fund our future capital investments and, therefore, we will be dependent upon our ability to access third-party sources of capital, including the Revolving Facility and other sources of debt and equity capital. Our access to third-party sources of capital depends on a number of factors, including general market conditions, the market&#8217;s view of the quality of our assets, the market&#8217;s perception of our growth potential, our current debt levels and our current and expected future earnings. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the capital necessary to fund the investments we will be required to make in our existing portfolio or to acquire new properties on terms 

favorable to us or at all. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient level of third-party financing to fund our capital needs, our ability to achieve our business strategies will be materially adversely affected. 

Our expenses may remain constant or increase, even if our revenues decrease, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Costs associated with our business, such as debt repayments, real estate taxes, insurance premiums and maintenance costs, are relatively inelastic and generally do not decrease, and may increase, when a property is not fully occupied, rental rates decrease, a tenant fails to pay rent or other circumstances cause a reduction in property revenues. As a result, if revenues drop, we may not be able to reduce our expenses accordingly, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Property taxes may increase without notice. 

The real property taxes on our properties may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities. While the majority of our leases are under a net lease structure, some or all of such property taxes may not be collectible from our tenants, and for our vacant properties, we are unable to recover property taxes from any tenants. In such event, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, trading price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our principal and interest obligations and to pay dividends to our stockholders could be adversely affected, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Real estate property investments are illiquid. We may not be able to dispose of properties when desired or on favorable terms. 

Real estate investments are relatively illiquid. Our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions will be limited. No assurances can be given that we will recognize full value, at a price and at terms that are acceptable to us, for any property that we determine to sell. Our ability to successfully execute on our asset disposition and capital recycling sale program is dependent on market conditions, and such conditions have been and may continue to be unfavorable for commercial real estate generally and office assets in particular, as well as for buyer financing of these assets. In general, when we sell properties that are vacant or soon to be vacant, the valuation will be discounted if the new owner is required to make capital improvements and to reflect that the new owner will bear carrying costs until the property has been leased up and take the risk that the property may not be leased up on a timely basis, favorable terms or at all. As part of our asset disposition activities, we have sought and may continue to seek to sell properties to buyers who intend to re-develop the subject property. While these sale transactions can result in higher sale valuations, they also normally require us as seller to bear a portion of the buyer&#8217;s redevelopment risk through longer due diligence periods during which we remain responsible for carrying costs of the property and the buyer may terminate the transaction. Our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We could be exposed to losses on loans we have made to buyers of the properties we have sold. 

As part of our asset disposition activity, we have provided seller financing to certain buyers and may continue to do so. To date, these loans have been structured as first mortgage loans with an unsecured recourse guaranty from the buyer principal(s). The properties sold and that are collateral for the loans are currently vacant and not income producing, and therefore, payment of debt service is dependent upon the existence of independent assets or income of the buyer and the buyer principal(s), until the properties have been leased up and are generating income, or until the loan can be refinanced. These loans are subject to risk of default and delinquencies by buyers in paying debt service and foreclosure, and the risks of loss are greater than similar risks associated with mortgage loans made on income producing properties. Foreclosure of a mortgage loan and/or enforcing the recourse guaranty can be an expensive and lengthy process, and there can be no assurance we would be able to recover our investment and expected returns on the loans. The loans are subject to risks of a buyer&#8217;s inability to lease up the property or obtain permanent financing to repay the loan. In the event of any default under our loans, we bear the risk of loss of principal and non-payment of interest and fees to the extent of any deficiency between the amounts we recover from the mortgaged collateral and the recourse guaranty, and the principal amount and unpaid interest of the loan. To the extent we suffer such losses with respect to these loans, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We, our tenants and our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as environmental laws, state and local fire and safety requirements, building codes and land use regulations. 

We, our tenants and our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as environmental laws, state and local fire and safety requirements, building codes and land use regulations. Failure to comply with these requirements could subject us, or our tenants, to governmental fines or private litigant damage awards. In addition, 

compliance with these requirements, including new requirements or stricter interpretation of existing requirements, may require us, or our tenants, to incur significant expenditures. We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether future requirements, including any requirements that may emerge from pending or future climate change regulations or legislation, will develop. Environmental noncompliance liability also could impact a tenant&#8217;s ability to make rental payments to us. Furthermore, our reputation could be negatively affected if we violate environmental laws or regulations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

In addition, as a current or former owner or operator of real property, we may be subject to liabilities resulting from the presence of hazardous substances, waste or petroleum products at, on, under or emanating from such property, including investigation and cleanup costs, natural resource damages, third-party liability for cleanup costs, personal injury or property damage and costs or losses arising from property use restrictions. In particular, some of our properties are adjacent to or near other properties that have contained or currently contain underground storage tanks used to store petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, certain of our properties are on, adjacent to or near sites upon which others, including former owners or tenants of our properties, have engaged, or may in the future engage, in activities that have released or may have released petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. Cleanup liabilities are often imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such contamination, and the liability may be joint and several. The presence of hazardous substances also may result in use restrictions on impacted properties or result in liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages it incurs to address contamination. We also may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances or waste disposal or treatment facilities if we arranged for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances at such facilities, whether or not we own such facilities. Moreover, buildings and other improvements on our properties may contain asbestos-containing material or other hazardous building materials or could have indoor air quality concerns ( e.g. , from airborne contaminants such as mold), which may subject us to costs, damages and other liabilities including abatement cleanup, personal injury, and property damage liabilities. The foregoing could adversely affect occupancy and our ability to develop, sell or borrow against any affected property and could require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We are subject to risks associated with climate change. 

The physical effects of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations and business. To the extent the physical effects of climate change impact our markets, over time, we could experience declining demand for leasing our buildings or increasing costs associated with remediation and adaptation. Climate change may also make property insurance unavailable or available only with less favorable terms and increase energy and other operating costs. In addition, we face risks associated with the transition to a lower-carbon economy related to, among other things, federal, state and local legislation and regulations that are being implemented or are under consideration to mitigate the effects of climate change as well as evolving tenant preferences. The operating costs and capital expenditures associated with meeting new and evolving regulatory and legal requirements and tenant preferences, including those related to reporting and managing greenhouse gas emissions, could negatively impact our financial results. 

Increased scrutiny and changing expectations from investors, tenants, employees, and others regarding our sustainability, social, and governance practices (&#8220;sustainability&#8221;) and reporting could cause us to incur additional costs, devote additional resources and expose us to additional risks. 

Companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny related to their sustainability practices and reporting. Investors, tenants, employees, and other stakeholders have begun to focus increasingly on sustainability practices and to place increasing importance on the implications and social costs of their investments, business decisions and consumer choices. Many investors, particularly institutional investors, may use sustainability practices and scores to benchmark companies against their peers and as a basis for making investment or voting decisions. Given this increased focus and demand as well as the potential for future legal or regulatory requirements, public reporting regarding sustainability practices is becoming more broadly expected. If our sustainability practices and reporting do not meet investor, tenant, or employee expectations, which continue to evolve, our reputation and investor interest and tenant and employee retention may be negatively impacted. Any disclosure we make may include our policies and practices on a variety of sustainability matters, including corporate governance, environmental compliance, employee health and safety practices, human capital management and workforce inclusion and diversity. It is possible that investors and other stakeholders may not be satisfied with our sustainability reporting, our sustainability practices or the speed or comprehensiveness with which we adopt and implement them. In addition, the criteria by which we are benchmarked against our peers and scored may change. We could also incur additional costs and devote additional resources to monitoring, reporting and implementing various sustainability practices. Our failure, or perceived failure, to meet any goals and objectives we may set in any sustainability disclosure or the expectations of our various 

stakeholders could negatively impact our reputation, investor interest and tenant and employee retention, as well as our cost of or access to capital. 

Compliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act could result in substantial costs. 

Our properties must comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (the &#8220;ADA&#8221;) and any equivalent state or local laws, to the extent that our properties are public accommodations as defined under such laws. Under the ADA, all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. If one or more of our properties is not in compliance with the ADA or any equivalent state or local laws, we may be required to incur additional costs to bring such property into compliance with the ADA or similar state or local laws. Noncompliance with the ADA or similar state and local laws could also result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. We cannot predict the ultimate amount of the cost of compliance with the ADA or any equivalent state or local laws. If we incur substantial costs to comply with the ADA or any equivalent state or local laws, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Our assets may be subject to impairment charges. 

We regularly review our real estate assets for impairment, and based on these reviews, we have recorded and may continue to record impairment losses on our properties. Negative or uncertain market and economic conditions, as well as market volatility, increase the likelihood of incurring impairment losses. Other factors that could increase the likelihood of incurring impairment include actual or expected tenant vacancies, identification of a property for potential sale and a tenant bankruptcy or default. Such impairment losses may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Uninsured and underinsured losses may adversely affect our operations. 

We, or in certain instances, tenants at our properties, carry comprehensive commercial general liability, fire, extended coverage, business interruption, rental loss coverage, environmental and umbrella liability coverage on all of our properties. We also carry wind and flood coverage on properties in areas where we believe such coverage is warranted, in each case with limits of liability that we deem adequate. Similarly, we are insured against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts we believe to be adequate to reimburse us, on a replacement cost basis, for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period. However, we may be subject to certain types of losses that are generally uninsured losses, including, but not limited to losses caused by riots, war or acts of God. In the event of substantial property loss, the insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of the property. In the event of an uninsured loss, we could lose some or all of our capital investment, cash flow and anticipated profits related to one or more properties. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors also might make it not feasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed. Under such circumstances, the insurance proceeds we receive might not be adequate to restore our economic position with respect to such property, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Our business could be materially adversely affected by security breaches through cyber-attacks, cyber intrusions or otherwise. 

We face risks associated with security breaches, whether through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions, malware, computer viruses, business email compromise, compromised vendor software, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization and other significant disruptions of our information technology networks and related systems, which are essential to the operation of our business. These risks include potential operational interruptions, fraudulent transfer of assets or unauthorized access to and exposure of valuable and confidential data, ransom costs, increased cybersecurity protection and insurance costs, litigation and remediation costs and damage to our relationships with our tenants, among other things. There can be no assurance that our efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information technology networks and related systems will be effective. A security breach involving our information technology networks and related systems could disrupt our operations in numerous ways that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The obligations and requirements to which we are subject as a public company are extensive and will increase when we no longer qualify as an &#8220;emerging growth company.&#8221; 

As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act and are required to prepare our financial statements in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. These and other public company obligations and requirements place significant demands on our management, administrative and operational resources, including accounting and information technology resources. If we are unable to satisfy these compliance obligations in a timely and effective fashion, our ability to comply with our financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies could be impaired and our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. 

As of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we qualify as an &#8220;emerging growth company.&#8221; As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that apply to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the requirements to hold a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved. These exemptions will expire no later than December 31, 2026 (the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act), at which time our public company compliance demands and costs will increase. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on the exemptions available to us as an emerging growth company. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. 

Our business could be adversely impacted if there are deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting. 

The design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. While management will continue to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, there can be no assurance that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Even if we continue to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect fraud or misstatements. Failure to implement or maintain required controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation or maintenance, could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we or our independent registered public accounting firm discover a material weakness in our internal control, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, could reduce the market&#8217;s confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price. In addition, a delay in compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could subject us to a variety of administrative sanctions, including ineligibility for short form resale registration, action by the SEC, the suspension or delisting of our common stock from and the inability of registered broker-dealers to make a market in our common stock, which would further reduce our stock price and could harm our business. 

The success of our business depends on retaining officers and employees. 

Our continued success depends to a significant degree upon the contributions of certain key personnel including, but not limited to, Paul H. McDowell, our Chief Executive Officer, who would be difficult to replace. We cannot provide any assurance that Mr. McDowell or any of our other key personnel will remain employed by us. Our ability to retain such individuals, or to attract a suitable replacement should he leave, is dependent on the competitive nature of the employment market. The loss of services of Mr. McDowell or other key personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. No assurance can be given that we will be able to retain key employees, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The interest rate hedge instruments we have used and may continue to use to manage some of our exposure to interest rate volatility involve risk, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements. Failure to hedge effectively against such interest rate changes may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We may amend our investment strategy and business policies without stockholder approval. 

Our Board of Directors may change our investment strategy or any of our investment guidelines, financing strategy or leverage policies with respect to investments, developments, acquisitions, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and dividends at any time without the consent of our stockholders, which could result in an investment portfolio with a different risk profile. Such a change in our strategy may increase our exposure to interest rate risk, default risk and real estate market fluctuations, among other risks. These changes could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The Revolving Facility may limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock, including repurchasing shares of our common stock. 

Under the credit agreement governing the Revolving Facility, our dividends may not exceed the greater of (1) 100% of our adjusted funds available for distribution (as defined in the credit agreement), and (2) the amount required for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT. Any inability to pay dividends may negatively impact our REIT status or could cause stockholders to sell shares of our common stock, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The market price of our common stock may vary substantially. 

The market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. In addition, the stock market is subject to fluctuations in share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies. These fluctuations in the stock market may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Among the factors that could affect the market price of our common stock are: 

&#8226; actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our business, financial condition and operating results; 

&#8226; changes in revenues or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts or actions taken by rating agencies with respect to our securities or those of other REITs; 

&#8226; the ability of our tenants to pay rent to us and meet their other obligations to us under current lease terms; 

&#8226; our ability to re-lease spaces as leases expire; 

&#8226; our ability to extend or refinance our indebtedness as it matures; 

&#8226; any changes in our dividend policy; 

&#8226; any future issuances of equity securities; 

&#8226; strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings; 

&#8226; general economic, political and financial market conditions and, in particular, developments related to market conditions for the real estate industry; and 

&#8226; domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance. 

Risks Related to Our Status as a REIT 

Our failure to maintain our qualification as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes could have a material adverse effect on us. 

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT and believe we have been organized and have operated in a manner that has allowed us to qualify and to remain qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our initial taxable year ended December 31, 2021. We have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the IRS that we qualify as a REIT and the statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are not binding on the IRS or any court. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that we have qualified as a REIT or that we will remain qualified as such in the future. If we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT or lose our REIT status, we will face significant tax consequences that would substantially reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders for each of the years involved because: 

&#8226; we would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to regular U.S. federal corporate income tax; 

&#8226; we could be subject to increased state and local taxes; and 

&#8226; unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, we could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified. 

Any such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce our cash available for, among other things, our operations and distributions to stockholders. In addition, if we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we will not be required to make distributions to our stockholders. As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could materially and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. 

Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT. In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must satisfy a number of requirements, including requirements regarding the ownership of our common stock, requirements regarding the composition of our assets and a requirement that at least 95% of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources, such as &#8220;rents from real property.&#8221; Also, we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains. In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may materially and adversely affect our investors, our ability to maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a REIT relative to other investments. 

Even if we remain qualified as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we may be subject to some federal, state and local income, property and excise taxes on our income or property and, in certain cases, a 100% penalty tax, in the event we sell property as a dealer. In addition, our taxable REIT subsidiaries will be subject to income tax as regular corporations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. 

If either Realty Income or VEREIT failed to qualify as a REIT during certain periods prior to the Distribution, we would be prevented from electing to qualify as a REIT. 

Under applicable Treasury Regulations, if Realty Income or VEREIT failed to qualify as a REIT during certain periods prior to the Distribution, unless Realty Income&#8217;s or VEREIT&#8217;s failure was subject to relief under U.S. federal income tax laws, we would be prevented from electing to qualify as a REIT prior to the fifth calendar year following the year in which Realty Income or VEREIT failed to qualify. 

If certain of our subsidiaries, including our operating partnership, fail to qualify as partnerships or disregarded entities for federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT and would suffer other adverse consequences. 

One or more of our subsidiaries may be treated as a partnership or disregarded entity for federal income tax purposes and, therefore, will not be subject to federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners or its members, as applicable, which may include us, will be allocated, and may be required to pay tax with respect to, such partner&#8217;s or member&#8217;s share of its income. We cannot assure you that the IRS will not challenge the status of any subsidiary partnership or limited liability company in which we own an interest as a disregarded entity or partnership for federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating any subsidiary partnership or limited liability company as an entity taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we could fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests applicable to REITs and, accordingly, we would likely cease to qualify as a REIT. Also, the failure of any subsidiary partnerships or limited liability company to qualify as a disregarded entity or partnership for applicable income tax purposes could cause it to become subject to federal and state corporate income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners or members, including us. 

Any taxable REIT subsidiaries owned by us are subject to corporate-level taxes and our dealings with our taxable REIT subsidiaries may be subject to 100% excise tax. 

A REIT may own up to 100% of the stock of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. Both the subsidiary and the REIT must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a taxable REIT subsidiary. A corporation of which a taxable REIT subsidiary directly or indirectly owns more than 35% of the voting power or value of the stock will automatically be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. Overall, no more than 20% of the gross value of a REIT&#8217;s assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. In addition, the taxable REIT subsidiary rules limit the deductibility of amounts paid or accrued by a taxable REIT subsidiary to its parent REIT to assure that the taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation. The rules also impose a 100% excise tax on certain transactions between a taxable REIT subsidiary and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm&#8217;s length basis. 

Taxable REIT subsidiaries that we own or may form will pay federal, state and local income tax on their taxable income, and their after-tax net income will be available for distribution to us but will not be required to be distributed to us, unless 

necessary to maintain our REIT qualification. In certain circumstances, the ability of our taxable REIT subsidiaries to deduct interest expenses for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be limited. While we plan to monitor the aggregate value of the securities of our taxable REIT subsidiaries and intend to conduct our affairs so that such securities will represent less than 20% of the value of our total assets, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the taxable REIT subsidiary limitation or avoid the application of the 100% excise tax discussed above in all market conditions. 

Distribution requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility. 

To maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains, each year. We also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our taxable income (including net capital gains) each year. 

In addition, we are subject to a 4% non-deductible excise tax to the extent that we fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85% of our ordinary income for that calendar year, 95% of our capital gain net income for the calendar year, and any amount of that income that was not distributed in prior years. 

We intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the Code as well as to reduce our exposure to federal income taxes and the non-deductible excise tax. Differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable income, along with the effect of required debt amortization payments, could require us to borrow funds to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a REIT. 

We may make distributions on our common stock in common stock and/or cash. Our stockholders may sell shares of our common stock to pay tax on such dividends, placing downward pressure on the market price of our common stock. 

In order to satisfy our REIT distribution requirements, we are permitted, subject to certain conditions and limitations, to make distributions that are in part payable in shares of our common stock. Distributions of cash and common stock will be treated as dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, stockholders may be required to pay income tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash received in the distribution. If a stockholder sells shares of our stock to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of the stock at the time of the sale. Moreover, if a significant number of our stockholders sell shares of our stock to pay such taxes, it may cause the stock distribution to be viewed as economically equivalent to a dividend reduction and put downward pressure on the market price of our stock. Furthermore, we may be required to withhold federal income tax with respect to dividends paid to certain non-U.S. stockholders, including dividends payable in our stock. 

The tax imposed on REITs engaging in &#8220;prohibited transactions&#8221; may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes. 

A REIT&#8217;s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100% penalty tax. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, held in inventory primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. Although we do not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as inventory held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business, such characterization is a factual determination and no guarantee can be given that the IRS would agree with our characterization of our properties or that we will always be able to make use of the available safe harbors. 

Legislative or other actions affecting REITs could have a negative effect on us or our investors. 

The rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Changes to the tax laws, with or without retroactive application, could adversely affect us or our investors, including holders of our common stock or debt securities. We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect us or our investors. New legislation, Treasury Regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT, the federal income tax consequences of such qualification, or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us. Also, the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities, or an investment in other entities, could change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a REIT. 

Risks Related to an Investment in Our Common Stock 

Limitations on the ownership of our common stock and other provisions of our charter may preclude the acquisition or change of control of our Company. 

Certain provisions contained in our charter and certain provisions of Maryland law may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us and may thereby inhibit a change of control. Provisions of our charter are designed to assist us in maintaining our qualification as a REIT under the Code by preventing concentrated ownership of our capital stock that might jeopardize REIT qualification. Among other things, unless exempted by our Board of Directors, no person may actually or constructively own more than 9.8% of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our common stock by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, or 9.8% of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of our outstanding stock by value. Our Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, grant exemptions to the stock ownership limits, subject to such conditions and the receipt by our Board of Directors of certain representations and undertakings. 

In addition to these ownership limits, our charter also prohibits any person from: 

&#8226; beneficially or constructively owning, as determined by applying certain attribution rules of the Code, shares of our capital stock that would result in us being &#8220;closely held&#8221; under Section 856(h) of the Code; 

&#8226; transferring our capital stock if such transfer would result in our stock being owned by fewer than 100 persons (determined under the principles of Section 856(a)(5) of the Code); 

&#8226; beneficially or constructively owning shares of our capital stock to the extent such ownership would result in us owning (directly or indirectly) an interest in a tenant if the income derived by us from that tenant for our taxable year during which such determination is being made would reasonably be expected to equal or exceed the lesser of one percent of our gross income or an amount that would cause us to fail to satisfy any of the REIT gross income requirements; and 

&#8226; beneficially or constructively owning shares of our capital stock that would cause us otherwise to fail to qualify as a REIT. 

If any transfer of our shares of stock occurs which, if effective, would result in any person beneficially or constructively owning shares of stock in excess, or in violation, of the above transfer or ownership limitations (such person, a prohibited owner), then that number of shares of stock, the beneficial or constructive ownership of which otherwise would cause such person to violate the transfer or ownership limitations (rounded up to the nearest whole share), will be automatically transferred to a charitable trust for the exclusive benefit of a charitable beneficiary, and the prohibited owner will not acquire any rights in such shares. If the transfer to the charitable trust would not be effective for any reason to prevent the violation of the above transfer or ownership limitations, then the transfer of that number of shares of our capital stock that otherwise would cause any person to violate the above limitations will be void. The prohibited owner will not benefit economically from ownership of any shares of our capital stock held in the charitable trust, will have no rights to dividends or other distributions and will not possess any rights to vote or other rights attributable to the shares of our capital stock held in the charitable trust. 

Generally, the ownership limits imposed under the Code are based upon direct or indirect ownership by &#8220;individuals,&#8221; but only during the last half of a taxable year. The ownership limits contained in our charter are based upon direct or indirect ownership at any time by any &#8220;person,&#8221; which term includes entities. These ownership limitations in our charter are common in REIT governing documents and are intended to provide added assurance of compliance with the tax law requirements, and to minimize administrative burdens. However, the ownership limits on our common stock also might delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium price for shares of our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. 

Furthermore, under our charter, our Board of Directors has the authority to classify and reclassify any of our unissued shares of capital stock into shares of capital stock with such preferences, rights, powers and restrictions as our Board of Directors may determine. The authorization and issuance of a new class of capital stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of us, even if a change in control were in our stockholders&#8217; best interests, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us. 

The Maryland General Corporation Law (the &#8220;MGCL&#8221;) provides protection for Maryland corporations against unsolicited takeovers by limiting, among other things, the duties of the directors in unsolicited takeover situations. The duties of directors of Maryland corporations do not require them to: 

&#8226; accept, recommend or respond to any proposal by a person seeking to acquire control of the corporation; 

&#8226; authorize the corporation to redeem any rights under, or modify or render inapplicable, any stockholder rights plan; 

&#8226; make a determination under the Maryland Business Combination Act; or 

&#8226; act or fail to act solely because of the effect the act or failure to act may have on an acquisition or potential acquisition of control of the corporation or the amount or type of consideration that may be offered or paid to the stockholders in an acquisition. 

Moreover, under the MGCL, the act of a director of a Maryland corporation relating to or affecting an acquisition or potential acquisition of control is not subject to any higher duty or greater scrutiny than is applied to any other act of a director. The MGCL also contains a statutory presumption that an act of a director of a Maryland corporation satisfies the applicable standards of conduct for directors under the MGCL. 

The MGCL also provides that unless exempted, certain Maryland corporations may not engage in business combinations, including mergers, dispositions of 10% or more of its assets, certain issuances of shares of stock and other specified transactions, with an &#8220;interested stockholder&#8221; or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder, and thereafter unless specified criteria are met. An interested stockholder is generally a person owning or controlling, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting power of the outstanding stock of the Maryland corporation, unless the stock had been obtained in a transaction approved by its Board of Directors. These and other provisions of the MGCL could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a proxy contest, tender offer, merger or other change in control, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Market interest rates may have an effect on the value of our common stock. 

One of the factors that will influence the price of our common stock will be its dividend yield, or the dividend per share as a percentage of the price of our common stock, relative to market interest rates. If market interest rates remain elevated or increase, prospective purchasers of our common stock may expect a higher dividend yield, and higher interest rates would likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution. If market interest rates increase and we are unable to increase our dividend in response, including due to an increase in borrowing costs, insufficient funds available for distribution or otherwise, investors may seek alternative investments with a higher dividend yield, which would result in selling pressure on, and a decrease in the market price of, our common stock. As a result, the price of our common stock may decrease as market interest rates increase, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The number of shares of our common stock available for future issuance or sale could adversely affect the per share trading price of our common stock and may be dilutive to current stockholders. 

Our charter authorizes our Board of Directors to, among other things, issue additional shares of our common stock without stockholder approval. In addition, our Board of Directors has the power under our charter to amend our charter to increase (or decrease) the number of authorized shares of our stock of any class from time to time, without approval of our stockholders. We cannot predict whether future issuances or sales of shares of our common stock, or the availability of shares for resale in the open market, will decrease the per share trading price of our common stock. The issuance of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the open market or the issuance of a substantial number of shares of our common stock upon the exercise of the warrants granted to affiliates of Arch Street Capital Partners in connection with the Distribution or the exchange of OP units or other securities exchangeable or convertible into shares of our common stock, or the perception that such issuances might occur, could adversely affect the per share trading price of our common stock. In addition, any such issuance could dilute our existing stockholders&#8217; interests in our company. In addition, we have adopted an equity compensation plan, and we have issued and expect to continue to issue shares of our common stock or grant equity incentive awards exercisable for or convertible or exchangeable into shares of our common stock under the plan. Future issuances of shares of our common stock may be dilutive to existing stockholders, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Future offerings of debt securities, which would be senior to our common stock upon liquidation, or preferred equity securities which may be senior to our common stock for purposes of dividends or upon liquidation, may materially adversely affect the per share trading price of our common stock. 

In the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making additional offerings of debt or equity securities (or causing Orion OP to issue such debt securities), including medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes and additional classes or series of preferred stock. Upon liquidation, holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock or preferred units and lenders with respect to other borrowings will be entitled to receive our available assets prior to distribution of such assets to holders of our common stock. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we may issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and may result in dilution to owners of our common stock. Holders of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution. Any shares of preferred stock or preferred units that we issue in the future could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividends that could limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Any such future offerings may reduce the per share trading price of our common stock, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Our ability to pay dividends is limited by the requirements of Maryland law. 

Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is limited by Maryland law. Under the MGCL, a Maryland corporation, including Orion, generally may not pay a dividend if, after giving effect to the dividend, the corporation would not be able to pay its debts as such debts become due in the ordinary course of business or the corporation&#8217;s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus , unless the corporation&#8217;s charter permits otherwise, the amount that would be needed, if the corporation were dissolved at the time of the dividend, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of stockholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the dividend. If we are unable to pay dividends, or our ability to pay dividends is limited, investors may seek alternative investments, which would result in selling pressure on, and a decrease in the market price of, our common stock. As a result, the price of our common stock may decrease, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We may change our dividend policy. 

Future dividends will be declared and paid at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and the amount and timing of dividends will depend upon cash generated by operating activities, our business, financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code, and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant. Our Board of Directors may change our dividend policy at any time, and there can be no assurance as to the manner in which future dividends will be paid or that the current dividend level will be maintained in future periods. Any reduction in our dividends may cause investors to seek alternative investments, which would result in selling pressure on, and a decrease in the market price of, our common stock. As a result, the price of our common stock may decrease, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the following discussion of material risks, events and uncertainties that make an investment in us speculative or risky in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report. A manifestation of any of the following risks and uncertainties could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, materially and adversely affect our business and operations, growth, reputation, prospects, operating and financial results, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price. Some of the factors, events and contingencies discussed below may have occurred in the past, but the disclosures below are not representations as to whether or not the factors, events or contingencies have occurred in the past and instead reflect our beliefs and opinions as to the factors, events or contingencies that could materially and adversely affect us in the future. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Other events, factors or uncertainties that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, other key metrics and the trading price of our common stock. Therefore, you should not consider the following risks to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face.

Operational and Execution Risks 

If our security measures or those of our third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers or third-party service partners, or the underlying infrastructure of the Internet are breached, and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer&#8217;s data, our data or our IT systems, or authorized access is blocked or disabled, our services may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our services, and we may incur significant reputational harm, legal exposure and liabilities, or a negative financial impact. 

Our services involve the storage and transmission of our customers&#8217; and our customers&#8217; customers&#8217; proprietary and other sensitive data, including financial, health and other personal information. Our services and underlying infrastructure may in the future be materially breached or compromised as a result of the following: 

&#8226; third-party attempts to fraudulently induce our employees, partners or customers to disclose sensitive information to gain access to our customers&#8217; data or IT systems, or our data or our IT systems; 

&#8226; efforts by hackers or sophisticated groups, such as criminal organizations, state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, to launch coordinated cyberattacks on internally built infrastructure or on third-party cloud-computing platform providers, including ransomware, destructive malware and distributed denial-of-service attacks; 

&#8226; third-party attempts to abuse our marketing, advertising, messaging or social products and functionalities to impersonate persons or organizations and disseminate information that is false, misleading or malicious; 

&#8226; vulnerabilities existing within new technologies and infrastructures, including those from acquired companies, or resulting from enhancements and updates to our existing service offerings; 

&#8226; vulnerabilities in the products or components across the broad ecosystem that our services operate in conjunction with and are dependent on; 

&#8226; attacks on, or vulnerabilities in, the many different underlying networks and services that power the Internet that our products depend on, most of which are not under our control or the control of our vendors, partners or customers; and 

&#8226; employee or contractor errors or intentional acts that compromise our security systems. 

These risks are mitigated, to the extent possible, by our ability to maintain and improve business and data governance policies and enhance processes and internal security controls, including our ability to escalate and respond to known and potential risks. We can provide no assurances that our security measures, including implemented systems and processes designed to protect our customers&#8217; and our customers&#8217; customers&#8217; proprietary and other sensitive data, will provide absolute security or otherwise be effective or that a material breach will not occur. For example, our ability to mitigate these risks may be impacted by the following: 

&#8226; evolving techniques used to breach or sabotage IT systems and infrastructure, including as a result of the increased use of AI technologies by bad actors, which are generally not recognized until launched against a target, and could result in our being unable to anticipate or implement adequate measures to prevent such techniques; 

&#8226; the increasing complexity of our internal IT systems as we incorporate and secure IT environments from acquired companies and early adoption of new technologies and new ways of sharing data; and 

&#8226; our limited control over our customers or third-party technology providers (including those authorized by customers to access their data), or the processing of data by third-party technology providers, which may not allow us to maintain the integrity or security of such transmissions or processing. 

In the normal course of business, we are and have been the target of malicious cyberattacks and have experienced other security incidents. Although, to date, such identified security events have not had a material financial impact, there can be no assurance that future cyberattacks will not be material or significant. Additionally, as our market presence grows, we may face increased risks of cyberattacks or security threats, and as AI technologies, including generative AI models, develop rapidly, threat actors are using these technologies to create new sophisticated attack methods that are increasingly automated, targeted and coordinated and more difficult to defend against. 

A security breach or incident could result in unauthorized parties obtaining access to, or the denial of authorized access to, our IT systems or data, or our customers&#8217; systems or data, including intellectual property and proprietary, sensitive or other confidential information. We have contractual and other legal obligations to notify relevant stakeholders of security breaches. For example, SEC rules require disclosure on Form 8-K of the nature, scope and timing of any material cybersecurity incident and the reasonably likely impact of any such incident. A security breach or resulting mandatory disclosure could result in a loss of confidence in the security of our services, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales, disrupt our business and lead to increases in insurance premiums and legal, regulatory and financial exposure and liability. Further, there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business, or reputational losses that may result from a cybersecurity incident or breach of our IT systems. Finally, the detection, prevention and remediation of known or potential security vulnerabilities, including determining whether a cybersecurity incident is notifiable or reportable, may not be straightforward and may result in additional financial burdens due to additional direct and indirect costs to respond to or alleviate problems caused by the actual or perceived security breach, such as additional infrastructure capacity spending to mitigate any system degradation and the reallocation of resources from development activities. 

Defects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability. 

We have in the past and may in the future find defects in or experience disruptions to our services. Such issues may arise in a variety of circumstances, including due to our customers using our services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in services for other customers attempting to access their data; as a result of employee, contractor or other third-party action or inaction; or due to the complexity of our services, which incorporate a variety of hardware, proprietary software and third-party and open-source software. Across the industry, cloud services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We may also encounter difficulties integrating acquired or licensed technologies into our services and in augmenting the technologies we use to meet quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation, which may result in our services containing errors or defects. 

We have experienced and may in the future experience defects in our products that create vulnerabilities that inadvertently permit access to protected customer data. We can provide no assurance that such product defects or other vulnerabilities will not occur in the future, have a material adverse effect on our business or subject us to substantial liability. Vulnerabilities in open source or any proprietary or third-party product can persist even after security patches have been issued if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching was complete. In some cases, vulnerabilities may not be immediately detected, which may make it difficult to recover critical services and lead to damaged assets. 

Since our customers use our services for important aspects of their business, errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems have in the past adversely impacted our customers&#8217; businesses and could do so in the future. As a result, customers could elect to not renew our services or delay or withhold payment to us. We could also lose future sales or customers may make warranty or other claims against us, which could result in an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts, an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation. 

Any interruptions or delays in services from third parties, including data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers and other hardware and software vendors, as well as internet availability, or from our inability to adequately plan for and manage service interruptions or infrastructure capacity requirements, could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business. 

We currently rely on third-party data center hosting facilities and cloud computing platform providers located in the United States and other countries, as well as the many different underlying networks and services that power the Internet, to deliver our products, services and business operations and to operate critical business systems. We also rely on computer hardware purchased or leased from, software licensed from, and cloud computing platforms provided by, third parties in order to offer our services, including database software, hardware and data from a variety of vendors. Any disruption or damage to, or failure of our systems generally, including the systems of third-party providers we rely on, could result in service interruptions and harm our business. We have from time to time experienced service interruptions and such interruptions may occur in the future. As we increase our reliance on these third-party systems, particularly with respect to third-party cloud computing platforms, our exposure to damage from service interruptions or other performance or quality issues may increase. Service interruptions or other performance or quality issues may cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, cause customers to make warranty or other claims against us or to terminate their subscriptions, and adversely affect our attrition rates and our ability to attract new customers, all of which would reduce our revenue. Our business and reputation would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable. 

For many of our offerings, our production environment and customers&#8217; data are replicated in a separate facility located elsewhere. Certain offerings, including some offerings of companies added through acquisitions, may be served through alternate facilities or arrangements. We do not control the operation of any of these facilities, and they may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of destruction or vandalism or similar misconduct, as well as local administrative actions, changes to legal or permitting requirements and litigation to stop, limit or delay operation. In addition, supply chain disruptions due to geopolitical developments in Europe may lead to power disruptions in regions where our facilities are located. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, such as disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, the occurrence of any of the foregoing events or risks, or a natural disaster or public health emergency, an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems or operational failures at these facilities could result in lengthy service interruptions, and no assurance can be provided that any such interruptions would be remediated without significant cost or in a timely manner or at all. 

The hardware, software, data and cloud computing platforms that we rely on, including, for example, the large language models leveraged in our AI offerings, may not continue to be available at reasonable prices, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of these hardware, software, data or cloud computing platforms could significantly increase our expenses and disrupt or otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained through purchase or license and integrated into our services, and no assurance can be provided that such equivalent technology would be developed or obtained in a timely manner or at all. 

As we scale our operations, the amount and type of information transferred on our offerings continues to evolve, including as a result of the deployment of AI technologies, and our infrastructure capacity requirements, including network capacity and computing power, may increase as a result. If we do not accurately plan for our infrastructure capacity requirements and we experience significant strains on our data center capacity, our customers could experience performance degradation or service outages that may subject us to financial liabilities, result in customer losses and harm our reputation and business. As we add data centers and capacity and continue to move to cloud computing platform providers, we move or transfer our data and our customers&#8217; data from time to time. Despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the delivery of our services, which may damage our business. 

As we acquire companies or technologies, we may not realize the expected business or financial benefits and the acquisitions could prove difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results and the market value of our common stock. 

As part of our business strategy, we periodically acquire complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies and intellectual property rights. We continue to evaluate such opportunities and expect to make such acquisitions in the future. 

Acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve numerous risks and could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including: 

&#8226; potential failure to achieve the expected benefits on a timely basis or at all; 

&#8226; potential identified or unknown security vulnerabilities in acquired products that expose us to additional security risks or delay our ability to integrate the product into our service offerings, as well as difficulties in increasing or maintaining the security standards for acquired technology; 

&#8226; difficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and customer acceptance of multiple platforms on a temporary or permanent basis; 

&#8226; brand or reputational harm associated with our acquired companies; 

&#8226; challenges converting the acquired company&#8217;s revenue recognition policies and forecasting the related revenues, including both consumption- and subscription-based revenues and term software license revenue, as well as appropriate allocation of the customer consideration to the individual deliverables; 

&#8226; challenges entering into new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions; 

&#8226; currency and regulatory risks associated with foreign countries and potential additional cybersecurity and compliance risks resulting from entry into new markets; 

&#8226; operational and financial difficulties and strains on resources in integrating acquired operations, technologies, services, platforms and personnel; 

&#8226; regulatory challenges from antitrust or other regulatory authorities that may block, delay or impose conditions (such as divestitures, ownership or operational restrictions or other structural or behavioral remedies) on the completion of transactions or the integration of acquired operations; 

&#8226; failure to fully assimilate, integrate or retrain acquired employees, which may lead to retention risk with respect to both key acquired employees and our existing key employees or disruption to existing teams or our workplace culture; 

&#8226; challenges with maintaining the acquired company&#8217;s customers, partners and third-party service providers; 

&#8226; known and potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses, including due to litigation; 

&#8226; difficulties in managing, or potential write-offs of, acquired assets, and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers; 

&#8226; negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and operating lease right-of-use assets; 

&#8226; difficulties in and financial costs of addressing acquired compensation structures inconsistent with our compensation structure; 

&#8226; additional stock-based compensation issued or assumed in connection with the acquisition, including the impact on stockholder dilution and our results of operations; 

&#8226; ineffective or inadequate controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company; and 

&#8226; the tax effects related to integration and business operation changes, realizability of our deferred tax assets, and uncertain tax liabilities. 

Any of these risks could harm our business or negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, to facilitate acquisitions, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, which may affect our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions, and which may affect the risks of owning our common stock. For example, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans, our existing stockholders may be diluted, or we could face constraints related to the terms of, and repayment obligation related to, the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect the market price of our common stock. 

Our ability to acquire other businesses or technologies, or integrate acquired businesses effectively, may be impaired by trade tensions and increased global scrutiny of foreign investments and acquisitions in the technology sector. For example, several countries, including the United States and countries in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, are considering or have adopted restrictions of varying kinds on transactions involving foreign investments and acquisitions. Antitrust authorities in a number of countries have also reviewed acquisitions in the technology industry with increased scrutiny. Governments may continue to adopt or tighten restrictions of this nature, some of which may apply to acquisitions or integrations of businesses by us, and such restrictions or government actions could negatively impact our business and financial results. 

Supporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources and infrastructure, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan. 

We continue to experience significant growth in our customer base, including through acquisitions, which has placed a strain on and in the future may strain our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. We anticipate that significant additional investments, including in human capital software, as well as leveraging agentic AI and other technologies, will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our services, to expand into new geographic areas and to scale with our overall growth. These investments will increase our cost base, making it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the 

short term. We may not be able to make these investments as quickly or effectively as necessary to successfully scale our operations. 

We regularly upgrade or replace our various software systems and processes. If the implementations of these new applications are delayed, or if we encounter unforeseen problems with our new systems and processes or in migrating away from our existing systems and processes, our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted. 

Our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to plan and manage our projected growth effectively. To do so, we must continue to increase the productivity of our existing employees and to hire, train and manage new employees as needed. Additionally, changes in our work environment and workforce may not meet the needs and expectations of our workforce or may create operational and workplace culture challenges, which could negatively impact our ability to increase employee productivity or attract and retain our employees and could adversely affect our operations. To manage the expected domestic and international growth of our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, our reporting systems and procedures and our utilization of real estate. If we fail to successfully scale our operations and increase productivity, we may be unable to execute our business plan and the value of our common stock could decline. 

If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or if they reduce the number of paying subscriptions at the time of renewal, our revenue and current remaining performance obligation could decline and our business may suffer. If customer usage of certain consumption-based offerings is below expected levels, our revenue could decline. If we cannot accurately predict subscription renewals or upgrade rates or optimal pricing for consumption-based contracts, we may not meet our revenue targets, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 

Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our services after the expiration of their contractual subscription period, which is typically 12 to 36 months, and in the normal course of business, some customers have elected not to renew. In addition, our customers may renew for fewer subscriptions, renew for shorter contract lengths or switch to lower cost offerings of our services, particularly in times of general economic uncertainty. It is difficult to predict attrition rates given our varied customer base and the number of multi-year subscription contracts. Our attrition rates may increase or fluctuate as a result of various factors, including customer dissatisfaction with our services, customers&#8217; spending levels, mix of customer base, decreases in the number of users at our customers, competition, pricing increases or changes, such as the increased prevalence of consumption-based pricing models and economic downturns. 

Our future success also depends in part on our ability to sell additional features and services, more subscriptions or enhanced editions of our services to our current customers. This may also require increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. Similarly, the rate at which our customers purchase new or enhanced services depends on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and customer receptiveness to any price changes related to these additional features and services. 

In addition, the markets and monetization strategies for certain offerings, including Agentforce and Data Cloud, remain relatively new and uncertain and as a result our expansion into such offerings, and related investments, may present additional risks and challenges. For example, we offer certain products, including Agentforce and Data Cloud, through a consumption-based business model and may increase the number of products through which we do so. We have limited experience with determining optimal pricing for our consumption-based contracts. Additionally, due to customer flexibility in the timing of their consumption, we could have lower levels of customer consumption of our products than we expect which may result in suboptimal pricing for consumption-based contracts. 

Periodic changes to our sales organization can be disruptive and may reduce our rate of growth. 

We periodically change and make adjustments to our sales organization in response to market opportunities, competitive threats, management changes, product introductions or enhancements, acquisitions, sales performance, increases in sales headcount, cost levels and other internal and external considerations. Such sales organization changes have in some periods resulted in, and may in the future result in, a reduction of productivity, which could negatively impact our rate of growth in the current and future quarters and operating results, including revenue. In addition, any significant change to the way we structure our compensation of our sales organization may be disruptive and may affect our revenue growth. 

Sales to customers outside the United States expose us to risks inherent in international operations. 

We sell our services throughout the world and are subject to risks and challenges associated with international business. We intend to seek to continue to expand our international sales efforts. The risks and challenges associated with sales to customers outside the United States or those that can affect international operations generally, include: 

&#8226; regional economic and political conditions, natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism and actual or threatened public health emergencies; 

&#8226; localization of our services, including translation into foreign languages and associated expenses; 

&#8226; regulatory frameworks or business practices favoring local competitors; 

&#8226; pressure on the creditworthiness of sovereign nations, where we have customers and a balance of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; 

&#8226; foreign currency fluctuations and controls, which may make our services more expensive for international customers and could add volatility to or negatively impact our operating results; 

&#8226; compliance with complex and evolving governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, anti-corruption, import/export, customs, anti-boycott, sanctions and embargoes, antitrust, cybersecurity, sustainability and industry-specific laws and regulations, including rules related to compliance by our third-party resellers; 

&#8226; liquidity issues or political actions by sovereign nations, including nations with a controlled currency environment, could result in decreased values of these balances or potential difficulties protecting our foreign assets or satisfying local obligations; 

&#8226; vetting and monitoring our third-party resellers in new and evolving markets to confirm they maintain standards consistent with our brand and reputation; 

&#8226; treatment of revenue from international sources, evolving domestic and international tax environments and changes to tax codes, including being subject to and paying withholding taxes under foreign tax laws; 

&#8226; uncertainty regarding the imposition of and changes in trade policies, including trade wars, tariffs or other trade restrictions or the threat of such actions, or other geopolitical events, including the evolving relations between the United States and China, the United States and Russia, and ongoing conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine and the regional conflict in the Middle East; 

&#8226; perceptions of regions or governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate, resulting in negative publicity or reputational harm; 

&#8226; regional data privacy laws and other regulatory requirements that apply to outsourced service providers and to the transmission of our customers&#8217; data across international borders; 

&#8226; different pricing environments; 

&#8226; difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; 

&#8226; different or lesser protection of our intellectual property, including increased risk of theft of our proprietary technology and other intellectual property, and more prevalent cybersecurity risks, particularly in jurisdictions in which we have historically chosen not to operate; and 

&#8226; longer accounts receivable payment cycles and other collection difficulties. 

Any of these factors could negatively impact our business and results of operations. The above factors may also negatively impact our ability to successfully expand into emerging market countries, where we have little or no operating experience, where it can be costly and challenging to establish and maintain operations, including hiring and managing required personnel, and difficult to promote our brand, and where we may not benefit from any first-to-market advantage or otherwise succeed. 

As more of our sales efforts are targeted at larger enterprise customers, our sales cycle may become more time-consuming and expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and configuration challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results. 

As we target more of our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, including governmental entities, and specific industries, such as financial services and healthcare and life sciences, we may face greater costs, longer sales cycles, greater competition and less predictability in completing some of our sales. In these market segments, the customer&#8217;s decision to use our services is often an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, may require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our services, as well as addressing concerns regarding privacy and data protection laws and regulations of prospective customers with international operations or whose own customers operate internationally. 

In addition, larger customers and governmental entities often demand more configuration, integration services and features. As a result of these factors, these sales opportunities often require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met. 

Pricing and packaging strategies for enterprise and other customers for our existing and future service offerings, including for our AI offerings such as Agentforce, may not be widely accepted by new or existing customers. We offer certain products, such as Agentforce and Data Cloud, through a consumption-based pricing model, and we have limited experience with determining the optimal pricing for our consumption-based contracts. Due to customer flexibility in the timing of their consumption, we could have lower levels of customer consumption of our products than we expect may result in suboptimal 

pricing for consumption-based contracts. Our adoption of or failure to adopt, as well as the manner and time of, changes to our pricing and packaging models and strategies may harm our business. 

We may lose key members of our management team or development and operations personnel, and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth. 

Our success depends substantially upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key members of management, particularly our chief executive officer. We are also substantially dependent on the continued service of our existing development and operations personnel because of the complexity of our services and technologies. Our executive officers, key management, development or operations personnel could terminate their employment with us at any time. Effective succession planning for management is important to our long-term success, and changes in our management team resulting from the hiring, departure or realignment of executives may be disruptive to our business. If we do not develop adequate succession planning for our key personnel, the loss of one or more of our key employees or groups of employees could seriously harm our business. 

The technology industry is subject to substantial and continuous competition for engineers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing software and technology services, as well as competition for sales executives, data scientists and operations personnel. We have experienced challenges with significant competition in talent recruitment and retention, and may not in the future be successful in recruiting or retaining such talent. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience difficulty in hiring, developing, integrating and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. These difficulties may be amplified by evolving restrictions on immigration, travel, or availability of visas for skilled technology workers. Additionally, our compensation arrangements and benefits may not always be successful in attracting new employees or retaining and motivating our existing personnel. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed. 

In January 2023, we announced a restructuring plan intended to reduce operating costs, improve operating margins and continue advancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth, which included a reduction of our workforce and office space reductions within certain markets. The workforce reduction was substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2024, and real estate actions are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2026. Additionally, throughout fiscal 2025 we initiated further targeted workforce and office space reductions. These restructuring actions, or any similar actions taken in the future, could negatively impact our ability to attract, integrate, retain and motivate key employees. 

In addition, we believe in the importance of our corporate culture, which fosters dialogue, collaboration, recognition, equality and a sense of family. As our organization has grown and expanded globally, and as our workplace plans have developed, including workforce and office space reductions related to our restructuring actions, we have experienced and may continue to experience difficulties maintaining our corporate culture globally, including managing the complexities of communicating with all employees. Any inability to maintain our corporate culture could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees, harm our reputation with customers or negatively impact our future growth. 

Any failure in the delivery of high-quality professional and technical support services related to our online applications may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results. 

Our customers sometimes require highly skilled and trained service professionals to successfully implement our applications and depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating to our applications. Implementation services may be performed by us, our customers, a third party, or a combination thereof. Our strategy is to work with third parties to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers. If customers are not satisfied with the quality and timing of work by us or a third party or with the type of services or solutions delivered, we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, our revenue recognition could be impacted and the customer&#8217;s dissatisfaction with the services received could negatively impact our ability to sell our other offerings to that customer or retain existing customers. In addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current or prospective customers. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services across our varying and diverse offerings. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure or perceived failure to maintain high-quality professional and technical support services could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our service offerings to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results and financial position. 

Strategic and Industry Risks 

The markets in which we participate are intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed. 

The market for enterprise applications and platform services is highly competitive, rapidly evolving, fragmented and subject to changing technology, low barriers to entry, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. Many prospective customers have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to implement and integrate their current enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate away from their current solution to a different enterprise software service. Additionally, third-party developers may be reluctant to build application services on our platform since they have invested in other competing technology platforms. 

Our current competitors include: 

&#8226; vendors of packaged business software, as well as companies offering enterprise applications delivered through on-premises offerings from enterprise software application vendors and cloud computing application service providers, either individually or with others; 

&#8226; software companies that provide their product or service free of charge as a single product or when bundled with other offerings, or only charge a premium for advanced features and functionality, as well as companies that offer solutions that are sold without a direct sales organization; 

&#8226; vendors who offer software tailored to specific services, industries or market segments, as opposed to our full suite of service offerings, including suppliers of traditional business intelligence and data preparation products, integration software vendors, marketing vendors, e-commerce solutions vendors or AI software and service vendors; 

&#8226; productivity tool and email providers, unified communications providers and consumer application companies that have entered the business software market; and 

&#8226; traditional platform development environment companies and cloud computing development platform companies who may develop toolsets and products that allow customers to build new applications, including AI-augmented applications, that run on the customers&#8217; current infrastructure or as hosted services, as well as would-be customers who may develop enterprise applications for internal use. 

In addition, we may face more competition as we expand our product offerings. Some of our current and potential competitors may have competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more significant installed bases, broader geographic scope, broader suites of service offerings and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical, personnel and other resources. In addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships and access to larger customer bases, and have major distribution agreements with consultants, system integrators and resellers. We also experience competition from smaller, younger competitors that may be more agile in responding to customers&#8217; demands and offer more targeted and simplified solutions. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements, or provide competitive pricing, more flexible contracts or faster implementations. Additionally, as we continue to increase building AI into many of our offerings, we face more competition as AI technologies are increasingly integrated into the markets in which we compete. New AI offerings may disrupt workforce needs and negatively impact demand for our offerings, or our competitors may be able to incorporate AI into their offerings more efficiently or successfully than we are able to and achieve greater and faster adoption. Even if our services are more effective than the products and services that our competitors offer, potential customers might select competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our competitors, which could negatively impact our future sales and harm our business. 

Our efforts to expand our service offerings and to develop and integrate our existing services in order to keep pace with technological developments may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate and harm our business. 

Our efforts to expand our current service offerings may not succeed and may reduce our revenue growth rate. In addition, the markets and monetization strategies for certain offerings, including Agentforce and Data Cloud, remain relatively new and uncertain and as a result our expansion into such offerings, and related investments, may present additional risks and challenges. For example, we offer certain products, including Agentforce and Data Cloud, through a consumption-based business model and may increase the number of products through which we do so. We have limited experience with determining optimal pricing for our consumption-based contracts. Additionally, due to customer flexibility in the timing of their consumption, we could have lower levels of customer consumption of our products than we expect which may result in suboptimal pricing for consumption-based contracts. Further, the introduction of future platform changes and upgrades may not result in long term revenue growth. 

If we are unable to develop enhancements to, and new features for, our existing or new services that keep pace with rapid technological developments, our business could be harmed. The success of enhancements, new features and services depends on several factors, including its timely completion, introduction and market acceptance, as well as our ability to integrate all of our product and service offerings and develop adequate selling capabilities in new markets. Failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth as well as negatively impact our operating results if the additional costs are not offset by additional revenues. In addition, because our services are designed to operate over various network technologies and on a 

variety of mobile devices, operating systems and computer hardware and software platforms, we need to continuously modify and enhance our services to keep pace with changes in these technologies, as well as continue to maintain and support our services on legacy systems. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market timely. 

Additionally, if we fail to timely anticipate or identify significant technology trends and developments, or if we do not devote appropriate resources to adapting to such trends and developments, our business could be harmed. Uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, modifications to existing platforms or technologies, including text messaging capabilities, or changes in customer usage patterns thereof could increase our research and development or service delivery expenses or lead to our increased reliance on certain vendors. Any failure of our services to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our services, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business. 

Our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brands. 

We believe that the brand identities we have developed, including associations with trust, customer success, innovation, equality and sustainability have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the Salesforce brand and our other brands is critical to expanding our base of customers, partners and employees. Our brand strength, particularly for our core services, depends largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and to continue to provide high-quality innovative products, services and features in a secure, reliable manner that enhances our customers&#8217; success even as we scale and expand our services. In order to maintain and enhance the strength of our brands, we have made and may in the future make substantial investments to expand or improve our product offerings and services, or we may enter new markets that may be accompanied by initial complications or ultimately prove to be unsuccessful. 

In addition, we have secured the naming rights to facilities controlled by third parties, such as office towers and a transit center, and any negative events or publicity arising in connection with these facilities could adversely impact our brand. 

Further, entry into markets with weaker protection of brands or changes in the legal systems in countries we operate may impact our ability to protect our brands. If we fail to maintain, enhance or protect our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. 

We are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments, including partial or complete loss of invested capital. Significant changes in the fair value of this portfolio could negatively impact our financial results. 

We manage a portfolio of strategic investments in both privately held and publicly traded companies focused primarily on enterprise cloud companies, technology startups and system integrators. While we invest in companies that we believe are digitally transforming their industries, advancing responsible generative AI, improving customer experiences, helping us expand our solution ecosystem or supporting other corporate initiatives, we may still experience unforeseen brand or reputational harm associated with our investments. Our investments range from early to late stage companies, including investments made concurrent with a company&#8217;s initial public offering. Investments in early stage companies are inherently speculative, as these companies may not yet be revenue-generating and could still be in the process of developing their products and services at the time of our investment. The financial success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering, acquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. Our investments may face challenges from regulatory authorities, including antitrust authorities, potentially resulting in unexpected costs, delays, or unfavorable conditions imposed on transactions involving our investment portfolio. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering. All of our investments are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of invested capital. 

We are exposed to volatility in our operating results due to changes in market prices, observable price changes and impairments of our strategic investments. The measurement of our non-marketable equity and debt securities at fair value is inherently subjective and requires management judgment and estimation. The resulting gains or losses could be material depending on market conditions and events, particularly in periods with economic uncertainty, inflation, geopolitical conflict, volatile public equity markets or unsettled global market conditions. 

If third-party developers and providers do not continue to embrace our technology delivery model and enterprise cloud computing services, or if our customers seek warranties from us for third-party applications, integrations, data and content, our business could be harmed. 

Our success depends on the willingness of a growing community of third-party developers and technology providers to build applications and provide integrations, data and content that are complementary to our services. Without the continued development of these applications and provision of such integrations, data and content, both current and potential customers may not find our services sufficiently attractive, which could impact future sales. In addition, for those customers who authorize a third-party technology partner to access their data, we do not provide any warranty related to the functionality, security or integrity of the data access, transmission or processing. Despite contract provisions to protect us, customers may look to us to 

support and provide warranties for the third-party applications, integrations, data and content, even though not developed or sold by us, which may expose us to potential claims, liabilities and obligations, all of which could harm our reputation and our business. 

Social and ethical issues, including the use or capabilities of AI in our offerings, may result in reputational harm and liability. 

Policies we adopt or choose not to adopt on social and ethical issues, especially regarding the use of our products, may be unpopular with some of our employees or with our customers or potential customers, and have in the past impacted and may in the future impact our ability to attract or retain employees and customers. Our decisions about whether to conduct business with potential customers, or whether to continue or expand business with existing customers, may also impact our ability to attract or retain employees and customers, and could result in negative publicity or reputational harm. Further, actions taken by our customers and employees, including through the use or misuse of our products or new technologies for illegal activities or improper information sharing, may result in reputational harm or possible liability, particularly in light of regulatory requirements like the Digital Services Act (&#8220;DSA&#8221;) from the EU. For example, we have been subject to allegations in legal proceedings that we should be liable for the use of certain of our products by third parties. Although we believe that we have a strong defense against these allegations, legal proceedings can be lengthy, expensive and disruptive to our operations and the outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Regardless of outcome, these types of claims could cause reputational harm to our brand or result in liability. 

We are increasingly building AI into many of our offerings, including generative and agentic AI. As with many innovations, AI offerings, such as Agentforce, and our Salesforce Platform present additional risks and challenges that could affect their adoption and therefore our business. For example, the development of our AI offerings and the Salesforce Platform, which provides information regarding our customers&#8217; customers, present emerging ethical issues. If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or in other social contexts, we may experience new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability, especially as geopolitical turmoil creates increasingly volatile political and market conditions. Inadequate or ineffective AI development, deployment, content labeling or governance by us or others that result in controversy could also impair the acceptance of AI solutions or result in unintended performance of the services. This in turn could undermine confidence in the decisions, predictions, analysis or other content that our AI applications produce, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability and brand or reputational harm. The rapid evolution of AI will require the application of resources to develop, test and maintain our products and services to help ensure that AI is implemented ethically in order to minimize unintended, harmful impact. Uncertainty around new and emerging AI applications such as generative AI content creation and AI agents will require additional investment in compliance, governance and the licensing or development of proprietary datasets, machine learning models and systems to test for accuracy, bias and other variables, which are often complex, may be costly and could impact our profit margin. Moreover, the move from AI content classification to AI content generation through our development of Agentforce and other generative AI products brings additional risks and responsibility. Known risks of generative AI currently include risks related to accuracy, bias, toxicity, privacy and security and data provenance. For example, AI technologies, including generative AI, may create content that appears correct but is factually inaccurate or flawed, or contains copyrighted or other protected material, and if our customers or others use this flawed or protected content to their detriment, or the owners of such copyrighted material seek to enforce their rights, we may be exposed to brand or reputational harm, competitive harm and/or legal liability. Developing, testing and deploying AI systems may also increase the cost profile of our offerings due to the nature of the computing costs involved in such systems. If we are unable to mitigate these risks, or if we incur excessive expenses in our efforts to do so, our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition may be harmed. 

The evolving landscape related to ESG matters may expose us to risks that could adversely affect our reputation and performance. 

Equality and sustainability are core values of the Company. In furtherance of these values, we have in the past and may in the future establish and disclose quantitative and qualitative statements related to ESG matters, which are aspirational and subject to numerous risks and dependencies. The proliferation of regulations addressing climate, human capital and other ESG topics at the regional, state, national and international levels has required and may continue to require significant effort and resources, and our practices, processes and controls may not ensure compliance with evolving standards. Further, various regulations may conflict with each other, making universal compliance challenging as a multinational company, and our status as a government contractor in various jurisdictions, including but not limited to the U.S. where we are headquartered, may also result in greater exposure or differentiated obligations or requirements with which we would seek to comply. The standards and frameworks for tracking and reporting on ESG matters continue to evolve, and our use, interpretation or application of such frameworks and standards may change from time to time or differ from those of other companies, which may result in a lack of consistent or meaningful comparative data from period to period or between Salesforce and other companies. In addition, our ESG practices and disclosures may not satisfy, appropriately respond to the concerns of or be supported by all investors, customers, partners, regulators, enforcement authorities or other stakeholders (including those in support of and those in 

opposition to various ESG practices), whose expectations and requirements are evolving and varied. Any violation of, non-compliance with or failure to meet such expectations or requirements, or negative publicity related to our ESG practices or disclosures, could result in harm to our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees, and our attractiveness as an investment, business partner, acquiror or service provider, could expose us to increased scrutiny or criticism or to regulatory or enforcement actions or litigation, and could cause us to incur increased costs to address or defend against such actions. 

Legal and Regulatory Risks 

Privacy concerns and laws as well as evolving regulation of cloud computing, AI services, cross-border data transfer restrictions and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our services and adversely affect our business. 

Regulation related to the provision of services over the Internet is evolving, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new, or modify existing, laws and regulations addressing data privacy, cybersecurity, data protection, data sovereignty and the collection, processing, storage, hosting, transfer and use of data, generally. In some cases, data privacy laws and regulations, such as the EU&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;), impose obligations directly on us as both a data controller and a data processor, as well as on many of our customers. In addition, domestic data privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (&#8220;CCPA&#8221;), and laws that have recently passed and/or gone into effect in many other states similarly impose new obligations on us and many of our customers, potentially as both a covered business and service provider. These laws continue to evolve, including, for example, India&#8217;s Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023, and as various jurisdictions introduce similar proposals, which often include subsequent rules and regulation, we and our customers become subject to additional regulatory burdens. New EU laws, including the DSA, the Data Act and the AI Act, may impose additional rules and restrictions on the use of our products and services. 

In addition, various safe harbors have historically been provided to those who hosted content provided by others, such as safe harbors from monetary damages for copyright infringement arising from copyrighted content provided by customers and others and for defamation and other torts arising from information provided by customers and others. There is an increasing demand for repealing or limiting these safe harbors by either judicial decision or legislation, and we have active legal proceedings that have been impacted by the repeal or limiting of safe harbors that were previously available to us. Loss of these safe harbors may require altering or limiting some of our services or may require additional contractual terms to avoid liabilities for our customers&#8217; misconduct. 

Although we monitor the regulatory, judicial and legislative environment and have invested in addressing these developments, these laws may require us to make additional changes to our practices and services to enable us or our customers to meet the new legal requirements, and may also increase our potential liability exposure through new or higher potential penalties for noncompliance, including as a result of penalties, fines and lawsuits related to data breaches. Furthermore, privacy laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. These and other requirements are causing increased scrutiny among customers, particularly in the public sector and highly regulated industries, and may be perceived differently from customer to customer. These developments could reduce demand for our services, require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to store, transfer and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability or our customers&#8217; ability to offer our services in certain locations, to deploy our solutions, to reach current and prospective customers, or to derive insights from customer data globally. For example, in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (&#8220;CJEU&#8221;) invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, one of the mechanisms that allowed companies, including us, to transfer personal data from the European Economic Area (&#8220;EEA&#8221;) to the United States. Even though the CJEU decision upheld the Standard Contractual Clauses (&#8220;SCCs&#8221;) as an adequate transfer mechanism, the decision created uncertainty around the validity of all EU-to-U.S. data transfers. While the EU and U.S. governments have since adopted the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework to foster EU-to-U.S. data transfers and address the concerns raised in the aforementioned CJEU decision, it is uncertain whether this framework will be overturned in court like the previous two EU-U.S. bilateral cross-border transfer frameworks. As a result, regulators may continue to be inclined to interpret the CJEU&#8217;s decision, and the logic behind it, as significantly restricting certain cross-border transfers and the cost and complexity of providing our services in certain markets may increase. Certain countries outside of the EEA have also passed or are considering passing laws requiring varying degrees of local data residency. By way of further example, statutory damages available through a private right of action for certain data breaches under the CCPA, may increase our and our customers&#8217; potential liability and the demands our customers place on us. 

The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, privacy laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services, reduce overall demand for our services, make it more difficult to meet expectations from our commitments to customers and our customers&#8217; customers, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, impact our reputation, or slow the pace at which we close sales transactions, in particular where customers request specific warranties and unlimited indemnity for noncompliance with privacy laws, any of which could harm our business. 

In addition to government activity, privacy advocates and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our ability to provide our services globally. Our customers expect us to meet voluntary certification and other standards established by third parties. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain customers and could harm our business. In addition, we have seen a trend toward the private enforcement of data protection obligations, including through private actions for alleged noncompliance, which could harm our business and negatively impact our reputation. For example, in 2020 we were made a party to a legal proceeding brought by a Dutch privacy advocacy group (the Privacy Collective) on behalf of certain Dutch citizens that claims we violated the GDPR and Dutch Telecommunications Act through the processing and sharing of data in connection with our Audience Studio and Data Studio products. In December 2021, the Amsterdam District Court declared the Privacy Collective&#8217;s claims against us inadmissible and dismissed the case, however, this ruling was appealed by the Privacy Collective. The appeal hearing took place in the Amsterdam Court of Appeal in February 2024 and the appellate court reversed the district court&#8217;s judgment. We have appealed that appellate decision to the Dutch Supreme Court. We were also named as a defendant in a similar lawsuit brought in the UK, which has subsequently been dismissed. Although we believe we have a strong defense for these claims, these or similar future claims could cause reputational harm to our brand or result in liability. In addition, a shift in consumers&#8217; data privacy expectations or other social, economic or political developments could impact the regulatory enforcement of privacy regulations, which could require our cooperation and increase the cost of compliance with the imposed regulations. 

Furthermore, the uncertain and shifting regulatory environment and trust climate may raise concerns regarding data privacy and cybersecurity, which may cause our customers or our customers&#8217; customers to resist providing the data necessary to allow our customers to use our services effectively. In addition, new products we develop or acquire in connection with changing events may expose us to liability or regulatory risk. Even the perception that the privacy and security of personal information are not satisfactorily protected or do not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions. 

Industry-specific regulations and other requirements and standards are evolving and industry-specific laws, regulations, interpretive positions or standards could harm our business. 

Our customers and potential customers conduct business in a variety of industries, including financial services, the public sector, healthcare and telecommunications. Regulators in certain industries have adopted and may in the future adopt regulations or interpretive positions regarding the use of cloud computing, AI services and other outsourced services. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers&#8217; use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services. Compliance with these regulations may also require us to devote greater resources to support certain customers, which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles. For example, some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions. If we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls, or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required, our business may be harmed. In addition, an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary third-party certification bodies that our customers may expect, such as an attestation of compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, may have an adverse impact on our business and results. Any inability in the future to achieve or maintain industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers may harm our business and adversely affect our results. 

Further, in some cases, industry-specific, regionally-specific or product-specific laws, regulations or interpretive positions may impact our ability, as well as the ability of our customers, partners and data providers, to collect, augment, analyze, use, transfer and share personal and other information that is integral to certain services we provide. The interpretation of many of these statutes, regulations and rulings is evolving in the courts and administrative agencies and an inability to comply may have an adverse impact on our business and results. This impact may be particularly acute in countries that have passed or are considering passing legislation that requires data to remain localized &#8220;in country,&#8221; as this may impose financial costs on companies required to store data in jurisdictions not of their choosing and to use nonstandard operational processes that add complexity and are difficult and costly to integrate with global processes. This is also true with respect to the global proliferation of laws regulating the financial services industry, including its use of cloud services. In Europe, the Digital Operational Resilience Act (&#8220;DORA&#8221;), which aims to ensure the resilience of the EU financial sectors, including through mandatory risk management, incident reporting, resilience testing and third-party outsourcing restrictions, went into effect in January 2025. The UK is advancing similar legislation and other countries may follow. 

Further, countries and states are applying their data and consumer protection laws to AI, and particularly generative AI, and/or are enacting or considering legal frameworks on AI, such as the Utah Artificial Intelligence Policy Act, the Colorado Artificial Intelligence Act and the draft CCPA regulations on automated decision-making technology. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business. 

There are various statutes, regulations and rulings relevant to direct email marketing and text-messaging, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (&#8220;TCPA&#8221;) and related Federal Communication Commission orders, which impose significant restrictions on the ability to utilize telephone calls and text messages to mobile telephone numbers as a means of communication, when the prior consent of the person being contacted has not been obtained. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to one or more class-action lawsuits, as well as individual lawsuits, containing allegations that one of our businesses or customers violated the TCPA. A determination that we or our customers violated the TCPA or other communications-based statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business. In addition, many jurisdictions across the world are currently considering, or have already begun implementing, changes to antitrust and competition laws, regulations or interpretative positions to enhance competition in digital markets and address practices by certain digital platforms that they perceive to be anticompetitive. These regulatory efforts could result in laws, regulations or interpretative positions that may require us to change certain of our business practices, undertake new compliance obligations or otherwise may have an adverse impact on our business and results. 

We have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims, including alleged infringement of proprietary rights. 

We are involved in various legal matters arising from the normal course of business activities. These include claims, suits, government investigations and other proceedings involving alleged infringement of third-party patents and other intellectual property rights, as well as commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, class actions, wage and hour, antitrust, data privacy, cybersecurity and other matters. 

The software and Internet industries are characterized by the existence of many patents, trademarks, trade secrets and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past and may receive in the future communications from third parties, including practicing entities and non-practicing entities, claiming that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We have also been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights. Our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages, or both. Further, many of our subscription agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim. 

In addition, we have in the past been, and may in the future be, sued by third parties who seek to target us for actions taken by our customers, including through the use or misuse of our products. For example, we have been subject to allegations in legal proceedings that we should be liable for the use of certain of our products by third parties. Although we believe we have a strong defense for these claims, such claims could cause reputational harm to our brand or result in liability. 

Our exposure to risks associated with various claims may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies. For example, we are subject to ongoing securities class action litigation and related stockholder derivative claims brought against Slack that remain outstanding, and as to which we may ultimately be subject to liability or settlement costs. Additionally, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to acquired companies or technologies. In addition, third parties have made claims in connection with our acquisitions and may do so in the future, and they may also make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition. 

The outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims or lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or licensing discussions, or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices, pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. 

Any adverse determination or settlement could prevent us from offering our services to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results, including our operating cash flow in a particular period. In addition, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our current or future results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. 

Any failure to obtain registration or protection of our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand, causing us to incur significant expenses and harm our business. 

If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors may gain access to our technology, affecting our brand, causing us to incur significant expenses and harming our business. Any of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. While we have many U.S. patents and pending U.S. and international patent applications, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications or the patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business needs. In addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive 

advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Similar uncertainty applies to our U.S. and international trademark registrations and applications. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain, and we also may face proposals to change the scope of protection for some intellectual property rights in the U.S. and elsewhere. Additionally, the intellectual property ownership and license rights, including copyright, surrounding AI technologies, which we are increasingly building into our product offerings, has not been fully addressed by U.S. courts or other federal or state laws or regulations, and the use or adoption of AI technologies in our products and services may expose us to copyright infringement or other intellectual property misappropriation claims related to AI training or output. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our services are available and legal changes and uncertainty in various countries&#8217; intellectual property regimes may result in making conduct that we believe is lawful to be deemed violative of others&#8217; rights. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the U.S., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Also, our involvement in standard-setting activity, our contribution to open source projects, various competition law regimes or the need to obtain licenses from others may require us to license our intellectual property in certain circumstances. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property. 

We may be required to spend significant resources and expense to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, it could impact our ability to protect our technology and brand. Furthermore, any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us, cause us to divert time and resources from our core business, and harm our business. 

We may be subject to risks related to government contracts and related procurement regulations. 

Contracting with federal, state, local and foreign governments or state-owned entities subjects us to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to these contracts&#8217; formation, administration and performance, and how we engage with government officials. We are from time to time subject to audits, inquiries and investigations relating to our government contracts, which may result in adverse perceptions of our business, reductions in utilization of our services or termination of our contracts without cause and at any time. Additionally, any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines and suspension or debarment from future government business, as well as reputational harm. Additionally, our contracting with certain government entities may result in negative publicity or reputational harm. Any of these risks related to contracting with governmental entities could adversely impact our future sales, costs of doing business and operating results. 

We are subject to governmental sanctions and export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and may subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws. 

Our solutions are subject to trade control laws and regulations where we conduct our business activities, including the U.S. Commerce Department&#8217;s Export Administration Regulations, U.S. customs regulations, U.S. supply chain regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control. If we fail to comply with applicable trade control laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of trade privileges; fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers; and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. Obtaining necessary authorizations, including any required licenses, may be time-consuming, requires expenditure of corporate resources, is not guaranteed, and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities or the ability to realize value from certain acquisitions or engagements. Acquisitions may also subject us to successor liability and other integration compliance risks. Furthermore, export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations may prohibit or limit the transfer of certain products and services to embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and parties. We can provide no assurance that any of the precautions we take to prevent our solutions from being provisioned or provided to sanctions targets in violation of applicable regulations will be effective, and, accordingly, our solutions could be provisioned or provided to those targets, including by our resellers or other third parties, which could have negative consequences for our business, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. Changes in our solutions or trade control laws and regulations may create delays in the introduction, sale and deployment of our solutions in international markets or prevent the export or import of our solutions to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Any decreased use of our solutions or limitation on our ability to export or sell our solutions may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Sanctions and export and import control regulations in the United States and other countries are subject to change and uncertainty, including as a result of rapidly evolving technology, increased government regulation of AI and cloud service solutions, and geopolitical developments such as events affecting relations between the United States and China, multi-jurisdictional sanctions on Russia, the war in Ukraine and regional conflict in the Middle East. Regulators in the United States and elsewhere have signaled an increased emphasis on sanctions and export control enforcement, including efforts to combat diversion of services to sanctioned countries and parties, several recent high-profile enforcement actions and increased pressure for companies to self-disclose potential violations. 

Financial Risks 

Because we generally recognize revenue from subscriptions for our services over the term of the subscription, downturns or upturns in new business may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. 

We generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription and support agreements, which are typically 12 to 36 months. As a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription and support agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue results for that quarter but will negatively impact our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our services, and changes in our attrition rate, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription and support term. 

If we experience significant fluctuations in our rate of anticipated growth and fail to balance our expenses with our revenue forecasts, our business could be harmed and the market price of our common stock could decline. 

Due to the unpredictability of future general economic and financial market conditions, including from the global economic impact of ongoing conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine and the regional conflict in the Middle East; the pace of change and innovation in enterprise cloud computing services; the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; uncertainty regarding changes in trade policy; changing interest rates and inflation; the growing complexity of our business, including the use of multiple pricing and packaging models and the increasing amount of revenue from term software license sales; and our increasing focus on enterprise cloud computing services, we may not be able to realize our projected revenue growth plans. We plan our expense and investment levels based on estimates of future revenue and future anticipated rate of growth. We may not be able to adjust our spending appropriately if the addition of new subscriptions or the renewals of existing subscriptions fall short of our expectations, and unanticipated events may cause us to incur expenses beyond what we anticipated. A portion of our expenses may also be fixed in nature for some minimum amount of time, such as with costs capitalized to obtain revenue contracts, data center and infrastructure service contracts or office leases, so it may not be possible to reduce costs in a timely manner, or at all, without the payment of fees to exit certain obligations early. Additionally, if sales through indirect channels or for consumption-based product offerings increase, this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting revenue and anticipated rate of growth. As a result, our revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and revenue growth rates may not be sustainable and may decline in the future. If we are not able to provide continued operating margin expansion, our business could be harmed and the market price of our common stock could decline. 

Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate and additional tax liabilities and global tax developments may impact our financial results. 

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various other jurisdictions. Significant judgment is often required in the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes. Our effective tax rate could be impacted by changes in our earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in operations, changes in non-deductible expenses, changes in the tax effects of stock-based compensation expense, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, the applicability of withholding taxes, effects from acquisitions and changes in accounting principles and tax laws. Any changes, ambiguity or uncertainty in taxing jurisdictions&#8217; administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions could also materially impact our income tax liabilities. 

We may also be subject to additional tax liabilities and penalties due to changes in non-income based taxes resulting from changes in federal, state, local or international tax laws, changes in taxing jurisdictions&#8217; administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions, results of tax examinations, settlements or judicial decisions, changes in accounting principles, or changes to our business operations, including as a result of acquisitions. Any resulting increase in our tax obligation or cash taxes paid could adversely affect our cash flows and financial results. 

We are also subject to tax examinations or engaged in alternative resolutions in multiple jurisdictions. While we regularly evaluate new information that may change our judgment resulting in recognition, derecognition or changes in measurement of a tax position taken, there can be no assurance that the final determination of any examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results or financial position. 

As our business continues to grow, increasing our brand recognition and profitability, we may be subject to increased scrutiny and corresponding tax disputes, which may impact our cash flows and financial results. Furthermore, our growing prominence may bring public attention to our tax profile, and if perceived negatively, may cause brand or reputational harm. 

Global tax developments applicable to multinational businesses may have a material impact to our business, cash flows, or financial results. Such developments, for example, may include certain provisions introduced by certain Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development&#8217;s proposals including the implementation of the global minimum tax under the Pillar Two model rules, and the European Commission&#8217;s and certain major jurisdictions&#8217; heightened interest in and taxation of 

companies participating in the digital economy. Furthermore, governments&#8217; responses to macroeconomic factors and tax revenue needs may lead to tax rule changes that could materially and adversely affect our cash flows and financial results. 

We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that have in the past and could in the future negatively impact our financial results and cash flows from changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar versus local currencies. 

We primarily conduct our business in the following regions: the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. The expanding global scope of our business exposes us to risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets, including in emerging markets. This exposure is the result of selling in multiple currencies, growth in our international investments, additional headcount in foreign locations, and operating in countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Specifically, our results of operations and cash flows are subject to currency fluctuations primarily in Euro, British Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real and Indian Rupee against the U.S. Dollar. These exposures may change over time as business practices evolve, economic and political conditions change and evolving tax regulations come into effect. The fluctuations of currencies in which we conduct business can both increase and decrease our overall revenue and expenses for any given fiscal period. Furthermore, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, combined with the seasonality of our business, could affect our ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings. 

Additionally, global events as well as geopolitical developments, including the war in Ukraine and regional conflict in the Middle East, fluctuating commodity prices, uncertainty regarding changes in trade policy and inflation, have caused, and may in the future cause, global economic uncertainty and uncertainty about the interest rate environment, which has and could in the future amplify the volatility of currency fluctuations. Although we attempt to mitigate some of this volatility and related risks through foreign currency hedging, our hedging activities are limited in scope and may not effectively offset the adverse financial impacts that may result from unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations. 

Our debt service obligations, lease commitments and other contractual obligations may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

As of January 31, 2025, we had a substantial level of outstanding debt, including our Senior Notes. We are also party to the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement, which provides for our $5.0 billion Credit Facility. Although there were no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility as of January 31, 2025, we may use the proceeds of future borrowings under the Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. 

In addition to the outstanding and potential debt obligations above, we have also recorded substantial liabilities associated with noncancellable future payments on our long-term lease agreements. We also have significant other contractual commitments, including leases that have not yet commenced and commitments with infrastructure service providers, which are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. 

Maintenance of our indebtedness and contractual commitments and any additional issuances of indebtedness could: 

&#8226; impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes; 

&#8226; cause us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations toward debt service obligations and principal repayments; and 

&#8226; make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general. 

Our ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulations. Further, our operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt or contractual obligations resulting from our leases. If we fail to make a payment on our debt, we could be in default on such debt. If we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness when payment is due, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness or obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. Any new or refinanced debt may be subject to substantially higher interest rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition and impact our business. 

In addition, adverse changes by any rating agency to our credit ratings may negatively impact our reputation, the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt. Downgrades in our credit ratings could also affect the terms of any such refinancing or future financing or restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future. 

The indentures governing our Senior Notes and the Revolving Loan Credit Agreement impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. A failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our outstanding debt could result in 

events of default under such instruments, which could permit acceleration of all of our debt and borrowings. Any required repayment of our debt as a result of a fundamental change or other acceleration would lower our current cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business. 

Lease accounting guidance requires that we record a liability for operating lease activity on our consolidated balance sheet, which increases both our assets and liabilities and therefore may impact our ability to obtain the necessary financing from financial institutions at commercially viable rates or at all. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. Periods beyond the noncancellable term of the lease are included in the measurement of the lease liability and associated asset only when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the associated extension option or waive the termination option. We reassess the lease term if and when a significant event or change in circumstances occurs within our control. The potential impact of these options to extend could be material to our financial position and financial results. 

Risks Related to Owning Our Common Stock 

Our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate, which may cause the value of our common stock to decline substantially. 

Our quarterly results are likely to fluctuate. Fluctuations have occurred due to known and unknown risks, such as the global economic impact of ongoing conflicts, including the war in Ukraine and the regional conflict in the Middle East, and uncertainty about the interest rate environment. In addition, our fiscal fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals, and the year-over-year compounding effect of this seasonality in billing patterns and overall new business and renewal activity causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter to continually increase in proportion to our billings in the other three quarters of our fiscal year. As a result, our fiscal first quarter has typically in the past been our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. 

Additionally, some of the important factors that may cause our revenues, operating results and cash flows to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include: 

&#8226; general economic or geopolitical conditions, including the impacts of the war in Ukraine and the regional conflict in the Middle East; financial market conditions; uncertainty regarding the imposition of and changes in trade policies, including trade wars, tariffs or other trade restrictions or the threat of such actions; and increasing costs of operation; 

&#8226; our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers and satisfy our customers&#8217; requirements, including large enterprise customers; 

&#8226; the attrition rates for our services; 

&#8226; the size and productivity of our workforce, as well as the cost to recruit and train new employees; 

&#8226; the length of the sales cycle for our services; 

&#8226; new product and service introductions by our competitors; 

&#8226; changes in unearned revenue and remaining performance obligation; 

&#8226; our ability to realize benefits from strategic partnerships, acquisitions or investments; 

&#8226; our ability to execute and realize benefits from restructuring actions and other workforce reductions, or any similar actions taken in the future; 

&#8226; variations in the revenue mix of our services and growth rates of our subscription and support offerings; 

&#8226; the seasonality of our sales cycle, as well as timing of contract execution and term software license sales; 

&#8226; the lack of certainty regarding customer usage and associated costs for consumption-based product offerings; 

&#8226; changes in and expenses associated with our pricing policies and terms of contracts; 

&#8226; the seasonality of our customers&#8217; businesses, especially our Commerce service offering customers; 

&#8226; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; 

&#8226; the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the operations and expansion of our business; 

&#8226; the timing of commission, bonus and other compensation payments to employees; 

&#8226; the cost, timing and management effort required for the introduction of new features to our services; 

&#8226; the costs associated with acquiring and integrating new businesses and technologies; 

&#8226; expenses related to our real estate or changes in the nature or extent of our use of existing real estate, including our office leases and our data center capacity and expansion; 

&#8226; timing of additional investments in our enterprise cloud computing application and platform services and in our consulting services; 

&#8226; expenses related to significant, unusual or discrete events, which are recorded in the period in which the events occur, including litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments; 

&#8226; income tax effects resulting from, but not limited to, tax law changes, court decisions on tax matters, global tax developments applicable to multinational corporations, changes in operations or business structures and acquisition activity; 

&#8226; the timing of stock awards to employees and payroll and other withholding tax expenses; 

&#8226; technical difficulties or service interruptions; 

&#8226; changes in interest rates and our mix of investments, which impact the return on our investments in cash and marketable securities; 

&#8226; changes in the fair value of our strategic investments, including changes due to impairments, particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations; 

&#8226; equity or debt issuances, including as consideration in or in conjunction with acquisitions; 

&#8226; evolving regulations of cloud computing, AI and cross-border data transfer restrictions and similar regulations; and 

&#8226; regulatory compliance and acquisition costs. 

Many of these factors are outside of our control, and the occurrence of one or more of them might negatively and materially impact our operating results. If we fail to meet or exceed operating results expectations or if securities analysts and investors have estimates and forecasts of our future performance that are unrealistic or that we do not meet, the market price of our common stock could decline. In addition, if one or more of the securities analysts who cover us adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock, the market price of our common stock could decline. 

The market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could subject us to litigation. 

The trading prices of the securities of technology companies have historically been highly volatile. Accordingly, the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. Factors affecting the market price of our common stock include: 

&#8226; variations in our financial results and how those results compare to analyst expectations; 

&#8226; variations in, and limitations of, the various financial and other metrics and modeling used by analysts in their research and reports about our business; 

&#8226; forward-looking guidance to industry and financial analysts related to future operating results, the accuracy of which may be impacted by various factors, many of which are beyond our control; 

&#8226; our ability to meet or exceed forward-looking guidance we have given or to meet or exceed the expectations of investors, analysts or others; our ability to give forward-looking guidance consistent with past practices; 

&#8226; changes to previous guidance or long-range targets, in the estimates of our operating results or in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock; 

&#8226; announcements or rumors of technological innovations, new services or service enhancements, strategic alliances, mergers or other strategic acquisitions or significant agreements by us or within our industry; 

&#8226; announcements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases; 

&#8226; the coverage of our common stock by the financial media; 

&#8226; recruitment or departure of key personnel; 

&#8226; disruptions in our service due to computer hardware, software, network or data center problems; 

&#8226; the economy as a whole, geopolitical conditions, including global trade and health concerns, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers, and financial institution instability; 

&#8226; trading activity or positions by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock, as well as other institutional or activist investors; 

&#8226; our ability to execute on our Share Repurchase Program as planned, including whether we meet internal or external expectations around the timing or price of share repurchases, and any changes to the program; 

&#8226; issuance of equity, debt or other convertible securities; 

&#8226; any increase to or reduction, suspension or elimination of dividend payments; 

&#8226; the inability to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective; 

&#8226; changes to our credit ratings; and 

&#8226; issues impacting our reputation. 

In addition, if the market for technology stocks or the greater securities market in general experience uneven investor confidence, the market price of our common stock has and could in the future decline for reasons unrelated to us, including as a reaction to events that affect other companies within, or outside, our industry. Some companies that have experienced volatility 

in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation, such as the securities litigation against Slack that was brought before our acquisition. Such litigation, whether against us or an acquired subsidiary, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management&#8217;s attention and resources and any liability resulting from or the settlement of such litigation could result in material adverse impacts to our operating cash flows or results of operations for a given period. 

Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of the Company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the market price of our common stock. 

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the market price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or changes in our management that the stockholders of the Company may deem advantageous. These provisions among other things: 

&#8226; permit the Board to establish the number of directors; 

&#8226; authorize the issuance of &#8220;blank check&#8221; preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a &#8220;poison pill&#8221;); 

&#8226; prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; 

&#8226; provide that the Board is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and 

&#8226; establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. 

In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15 percent or more of our common stock. 

There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends in any particular amounts, or at all. 

Whether we continue to pay cash dividends, as well as the rate at which we pay cash dividends, in the future is subject to continued capital availability, general economic and market conditions, applicable laws and agreements and our Board continuing to determine that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The declaration and payment of any dividend may be discontinued at any time and dividend amounts may be reduced at any time. A discontinuation of or reduction in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price. 

General Risks 

Volatile and significantly weakened global economic conditions have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. 

Our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic and geopolitical conditions. The United States and other key international economies have experienced significant economic and market downturns in the past, and are likely to experience additional cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity is impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, inflation, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. These economic conditions can arise suddenly and the full impact of such conditions can be difficult to predict. In addition, geopolitical and domestic political developments, such as uncertainty regarding changes in trade policy and other events beyond our control, such as war in Ukraine and the regional conflict in the Middle East, have increased and may continue to increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and the volatility of global financial markets. Moreover, these conditions have affected and may continue to affect the rate of IT spending; could adversely affect our customers&#8217; ability or willingness to attend our events or to purchase our enterprise cloud computing services; have delayed and may delay customer purchasing decisions; and have reduced and may in the future reduce the value and duration of customer subscription contracts or cause our customers to seek to modify their existing subscription contracts. All of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales, attrition rates and operating results. 

Geopolitical crises, natural disasters and other events beyond our control have in the past and may in the future materially adversely affect us. 

Geopolitical crises, natural disasters or other catastrophic events have in the past and may in the future cause damage or disruption to our people, operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could have a strong negative effect on us. Our business operations, the business operations of third-party providers or suppliers that we rely on to conduct our business and the business operations of our customers are subject to interruption by geopolitical crises, natural disasters, fire, power or water shutoffs or shortages, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of violence, political and/or civil unrest, acts of war or other military actions, actual or threatened public health emergencies and other events beyond our control. 

For example, the occurrence of regional conflicts, epidemics or a global pandemic have in the past and may in the future materially affect how we and our customers operate our businesses, as well as our operating results and cash flows. Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. Our corporate headquarters, and a significant portion of our personnel, research and development activities and other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in the San Francisco Bay Area. Because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct earthquake-related losses and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event, and the adverse effects of any such catastrophic event would be exacerbated if experienced at the same time as another unexpected and adverse event. 

Climate change may have an impact on our business. 

While we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change by establishing appropriate environmental programs and partnering with organizations who are also focused on mitigating their own climate-related risks, there are inherent climate-related risks where our business is conducted. Any of our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. For example, our offices globally have historically experienced, and are projected to continue to experience, climate-related events at an increasing frequency, including drought, water scarcity, heat waves, cold waves, flooding, wildfires and resultant air quality impacts and power shutoffs associated with climate-related events. These events in turn have impacts on inflation risks, the cost and availability of insurance, food security, water security (including for water availability for data center cooling), energy security and on our employees&#8217; health, productivity and well-being. Furthermore, it is more difficult to mitigate the impact of these events on our employees working remotely or at client sites. Changing market dynamics, global policy developments and the increasing frequency and impact of extreme weather events on critical infrastructure in the United States and elsewhere have the potential to disrupt our business, the business of companies we invest in, the business of third-party providers or suppliers that we rely on to conduct our business and the business of our customers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. In particular, climate-related events, energy market volatility, and power grid disruptions may increase the operational costs related to inputs across our value chain, including for data centers. Perceived associations with data centers&#8217; growing energy demand or data center/AI-related changes to existing environmental pledges in certain jurisdictions may also result in increased targeting of our sites and operations by activists. Additionally, failure to uphold, meet or make timely forward progress against our public commitments and goals related to climate action could adversely impact the resilience of our business to the impacts of climate-related events.

The factors described below represent our material risks. Other factors may exist that we do not consider material based on information that is currently available or that we are not currently able to anticipate. The occurrence of any of the risks discussed below could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, ability to pay distributions to our stockholders and the value of our shares of common stock. 

Risks Related to Our Business 

The review of strategic alternatives may not result in the sale of the Company or any other liquidity event in the near term, if at all. 

The board&#8217;s review of strategic alternatives may not result in a sale, merger or other strategic transaction or otherwise result in a liquidity event for stockholders. There is also no assurance as to how long the review will take or the outcome of the process. The outcome of any potential transaction or other liquidity event will depend on several factors many of which will be beyond our control including, among other things, market conditions including interest rates, inflation, industry trends, regulatory approvals, and the availability of favorable financing for a potential transaction. The process of reviewing strategic alternatives is time consuming and may be distracting to the employees of our Business Manager and Real Estate Manager and may be disruptive to our business. In addition, any perceived uncertainty regarding our future operations or business may limit the ability of our Business Manager or Real Estate Manager to retain or hire qualified personnel and may impact our ability to attract or retain tenants at our properties. 

We have incurred net losses on a basis in accordance with GAAP for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 and may incur such net losses in the future that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, operations, cash flow, and our ability to service our indebtedness and pay distributions to our stockholders. 

We have incurred net losses on a GAAP basis for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 of $15.0 million, $15.1 million and $12.6 million, respectively and future net losses could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, operations, cash flow, and our ability to service our indebtedness and pay distributions to our stockholders. 

The amount and timing of distributions, if any, may vary, and are not assured. We have paid and may continue to pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations. 

There are many factors that can affect the availability and timing of distributions paid to our stockholders including the outcome of our board&#8217;s review of strategic alternatives. We may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund any distributions to our stockholders. The actual amount and timing of distributions, if any, is determined by our board of directors in its discretion, based on its analysis of our actual and expected cash flow, capital expenditures and investments, as well as general financial conditions. Actual cash available for distribution may vary substantially from estimates made by our board. The sale of assets and delayed reinvestment or reinvestment at lower yields will negatively impact the amount available to pay distributions. In addition, to the extent we invest in development or redevelopment projects that do not immediately generate cash flow, or in real estate assets that have significant capital requirements, our ability to make distributions will be negatively impacted. Our board will continue to review our distribution policy as our strategic plan evolves. There is no assurance we will be able to pay distributions in the future at any particular amount. 

Historically, in the years prior to 2020, we did not consistently generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund distribution payments. Our organizational documents permit us to pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations. Specifically, some or all of our distributions may be paid from retained cash flow, if any, borrowings, cash flow from investing activities, the net proceeds from the sale of our assets or from future proceeds generated from sale of shares pursuant to the DRP (in the event the plan is reinstated). We have not established any limit on the extent to which we may use these alternative sources. 

Funding distributions from these other sources reduces the funds available for other purposes, including to acquire properties or other real estate-related investments. Likewise, funding distributions from the sale of additional securities, including shares issued under the DRP (if reinstated), would dilute our stockholders&#8217; interest in us on a percentage basis and may impact the value of the investment, especially if we sell these securities at prices less than the price our stockholders paid for their shares. As a result, the return our stockholders realize on their investment may be reduced. Doing so may also negatively impact our ability to generate cash flows. There is no assurance we will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to cover distributions. If these sources are not available or are not adequate, our board may have to consider reducing or eliminating distributions. 

We have limited sources of capital and have suspended our DRP pending review by the board of strategic alternatives. 

In connection with the board&#8217;s review of strategic alternatives, we suspended the DRP. While we expect to continue paying distributions during the pendency of the review of strategic alternatives, because the DRP was suspended, it will no longer be a source of capital. During the year ended December 31, 2024, distributions reinvested through the DRP generated capital of approximately $5.0 million. 

&#160; 

The SRP has been suspended. Even when in effect, stockholders&#8217; ability to sell their shares pursuant to the SRP is limited. There is no assurance that stockholders will be able to resell their shares at a price equal to or greater than the price paid for the shares. 

In connection with the board&#8217;s review of strategic alternatives, we suspended the SRP. During the suspension, we will not repurchase shares under the SRP. There is no assurance of when, or if, the suspension will be lifted if the review of strategic alternatives does not result in a transaction or event that results in a liquidity event for stockholders. While our SRP is suspended, it will be difficult for stockholders to sell their shares promptly or at all. If stockholders are able to sell their shares, stockholders would likely have to sell them at a substantial discount. Because of the lack of an established trading market for the share, it is also likely that a lender will not accept a stockholder&#8217;s shares as the primary collateral for a loan. 

Even if reinstated, our SRP contains numerous restrictions that limit our stockholders&#8217; ability to sell their shares even if the plan is reactivated. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may amend or terminate our SRP. The SRP will immediately terminate if our shares become listed for trading on a national securities exchange. Further, our board reserves the right in its sole discretion to change the repurchase prices or reject any requests for repurchases. Any amendments to, or termination of, the SRP may restrict or eliminate our stockholders&#8217; ability to have us repurchase their shares and otherwise prevent our stockholders from liquidating their investment. Therefore, our stockholders may not have the opportunity to make a repurchase request prior to a potential termination of the SRP and our stockholders may not be able to sell any of their shares of common stock back to us. As a result of these restrictions and circumstances, the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares should they require liquidity is significantly restricted. Moreover, under the SRP, any shares accepted for &#8220;ordinary repurchases&#8221; or &#8220;exceptional repurchases&#8221; are repurchased at a discount to the then-current Estimated Per Share NAV. Therefore, even if our stockholders are able to sell their shares of common stock back to us pursuant to the SRP, they may be forced to do so at a discount to the purchase price such stockholders paid for their shares. 

There is no established public trading market for our shares of common stock and the prior Estimated Per Share NAV should not be used. 

Our shares of common stock are not listed or included for trading on any national securities exchange. There is no established market for our shares. Our board is neither required to sell our assets and liquidate the Company by any specified date, nor is the board required to list our shares for trading on a national securities exchange by a specified date. As noted herein, there is no assurance the board will pursue a listing or other liquidity event as a result of the board&#8217;s review of strategic alternatives or otherwise at any time in the future. Even if the board decided to pursue a listing of our shares of common stock, we may not satisfy the listing requirements or otherwise be approved for listing. Thus, holders of our common stock should be prepared to hold their shares for an unlimited period of time. Our charter also prohibits the ownership of more than 9.8% in value of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our stock or more than 9.8% (in value or number whichever is more restrictive) of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our common stock by any single investor unless exempted by our board. 

To assist broker dealers with their customer account statement obligations, we last published an Estimated Per Share NAV in March 2024. The estimate represented a snapshot in time and as prior disclosure noted was likely to change over time and did not represent the amount a stockholder would receive either at the time the estimate was published or in the future for his or her shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock. Stockholders were also advised not to rely on the Estimated Per Share NAV in deciding to buy or sell shares of our common stock. The Estimated Per Share NAV was based on several assumptions, estimates and data that were and are inherently imprecise and susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances, including changes to the value of individual assets as well as changes and developments in the real estate and capital markets, such as noted below, market changes and developments that may result from the changes in interest rates. 

The board does not intend to publish a new estimate while reviewing or considering strategic alternatives and the dated estimate should no longer be used for any purpose. This may result in broker dealers declining to report a value or ascribing no value on account statements sent to stockholders. The board will only consider evaluating net asset value and publishing an estimate thereof if the strategic review does not result in a liquidity event or the board terminates its review of strategic alternatives. In the most recent past, the value of real estate assets generally has been negatively impacted by, among other things, changing assumptions regarding interest rates and Federal Reserve policy including the potential that the Federal Reserve will not reduce the &#8220;federal funds rate&#8221; during calendar year 2025 at the rate originally expected by the market. The value ascribed to real estate assets for purposes of estimating net asset value or by purchasers of real estate assets is sensitive to, and impacted by, the level of actual and expected interest rates, a slowing growth rate for, or the potential for declines in, gross national product, slowing growth or declines in the retail sector, concerns regarding inflation, and the uncertain impact of tariffs and tax policy. 

&#160; 

Our charter authorizes us to issue additional shares of stock, which may reduce the percentage of our common stock owned by our other stockholders, subordinate stockholders&#8217; rights or discourage a third party from acquiring us. 

Existing stockholders do not have preemptive rights to purchase any shares issued by us in the future. Our charter authorizes us to issue up to 1,500,000,000 shares of capital stock, of which 1,460,000,000 shares are classified as common stock and 40,000,000 shares are classified as preferred stock. We may, in the sole discretion of our board and without approval of our common stockholders: 

&#8226; sell additional shares in any future offerings, including as awards under our Employee and Director Restricted Share Plan and pursuant to the DRP; 

&#8226; issue equity interests in a private offering of securities; 

&#8226; classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common or preferred stock by setting or changing the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications, or terms or conditions of redemption of the stock; 

&#8226; amend our charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares or the number of shares of any class or series that we have authority to issue; or 

&#8226; issue shares of our capital stock in exchange for properties. 

Future issuances of common stock will reduce the percentage of our outstanding shares owned by our other stockholders. Further, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of stock with terms and conditions that could subordinate the rights of the holders of our current common stock, adversely affect the Estimated Per Share NAV or have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all of our assets) that might provide a premium price for our stockholders. 

Market disruptions may adversely impact many aspects of our operating results and the value of our assets. 

The availability of capital, including debt financing secured by commercial real estate or based on the value of the underlying real estate, including the cost and terms thereof, is subject to underwriting standards that can be tightened in response to adverse changes in real estate or credit market conditions including, but not limited to, increases in interest rates. Changes in the availability or cost of debt or equity capital may, among other things, impact the price a third party is willing to pay for the Company or the trading price of our shares of common stock if ultimately listed on a national securities exchange. Further, we have been impacted by, and in the future may continue to be impacted by, increases in interest rates. For example, when interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate debt increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows correspondingly decrease. Interest rates may increase further in response to changing economic conditions, which may negatively affect U.S. economic conditions as a whole, or real estate industry conditions such as: 

&#8226; the number of bankruptcies or insolvency proceedings of our tenants and lease guarantors, which could increase and delay our efforts to collect rent and any past balances due under the relevant leases and ultimately could preclude collection of these sums; 

&#8226; our ability to borrow on terms and conditions that we find acceptable, which may be limited and could result in our investment operations (real estate assets) generating lower overall economic returns and a reduced level of cash flow from what was anticipated at the time we acquired the asset, and could potentially impact our ability to make distributions to our stockholders, or pursue acquisition opportunities, among other things, and increase our interest expense; 

&#8226; the amount of capital that is available to be invested in or finance real estate, which could be reduced, and, in turn, could lead to a decline in real estate values generally, slow real estate transaction activity, and reduce the loan-to-value ratio upon which lenders are willing to lend; 

&#8226; the value of certain of our real estate assets, which may decrease below the amounts we pay for them and limit our ability to dispose them at attractive prices or to obtain debt financing secured by these assets and could reduce the availability of unsecured loans; 

&#8226; the value and liquidity of short-term investments, if any, could be reduced as a result of the dislocation of the markets for our short-term investments and increased volatility in market rates for these investments or other factors; and 

&#8226; defaults or bankruptcies by counterparties to derivative financial instruments could occur, increasing the risk that we may not realize the benefits of these instruments that we have entered into or may enter into.

Our board of directors may change our investment policies without stockholder approval, which could alter the nature of our investments. 

Our investment policies may change over time. The methods of implementing our investment policies may also vary, as new investment techniques are developed. Our investment policies, the methods for implementing them, and our other objectives, policies and procedures may be altered by a majority of the directors (which must include a majority of the independent directors), without the approval of our stockholders. As a result, the nature of our investments could change without stockholder consent. A change in our investment strategy may, among other things, increase our exposure to interest rate risk, default risk and commercial real property market fluctuations, all of which could materially adversely affect our ability to achieve our investment objectives. 

Development or redevelopments may expose us to additional risks. 

To the extent that we develop or redevelop assets, we will be subject to the uncertainties and risks relating to this activity including uncertainties regarding the cost of redevelopment or development activities which tend to be impacted by inflation and the amount and timing of returns as well as other risks including, but not limited to: 

&#8226; ceasing development or redevelopment activities after expending resources to determine the feasibility of the project or projects; 

&#8226; construction delays or cost overruns that increase project costs; 

&#8226; the failure to meet anticipated occupancy or rent levels within the projected time frame, if at all; 

&#8226; exposure to fluctuations in the general economy due to the significant time lag between commencing and completing the project; 

&#8226; inability to achieve necessary zoning or other governmental permits; and 

&#8226; difficulty or inability to obtain any required consents of third parties, such as tenants and, mortgage lenders. 

Further, while developing or redeveloping an asset or assets, our rental income from the impacted properties may be reduced. Delays in completing development may also impact leases with existing tenants or our ability to secure new tenants. Occurrence of any of these events would likely have a material adverse effect on the estimated value of our common stock, our cash flow from operations, ability to pay distributions and ability to pursue a liquidity event for our stockholders. In addition, development costs for a project may increase, which may result in reduced returns, or even losses. In deciding whether to develop or redevelop a particular property, we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property. If the property does not perform as expected, our financial performance may be materially and adversely affected, or an impairment charge could occur. 

Competition with other non-traditional grocery retailers may impact our tenants and reduce our profitability. 

Tenants in the grocery industry face potentially changing consumer preferences and increasing competition from other forms of retailing, such as online grocery retailers and non-traditional grocery retailers such as prepared meal and fresh food delivery services, mass merchandisers, super-centers, warehouse club stores and drug stores. Other retail centers within the market area of our properties and meal and food delivery services both inside and outside these market areas compete with our properties for customers, affecting our tenants&#8217; cash flows and thus affecting their ability to pay rent. 

&#160; 

Actions of our joint venture partners could negatively impact our performance. 

Although we do not have any current investments in joint ventures, we have entered, and may in the future enter, into joint ventures with third parties. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount of funds that we may invest in these joint ventures. We may develop and acquire properties through joint ventures with other persons or entities when warranted by the circumstances. The venture partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions and these investments may involve risks not otherwise present with other methods of investment in real estate, including, but not limited to: 

&#8226; economic conditions make it more likely that our partner in an investment may become bankrupt, which would mean that we and any other remaining partner would generally remain liable for the entity&#8217;s liabilities; 

&#8226; that our partner may at any time have economic or business interests or goals which are or which become inconsistent with our business interests or goals, and we may not agree on all proposed actions to certain aspects of the venture; 

&#8226; that our partner may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives, including our objective to qualify as a REIT; 

&#160; 

&#8226; that, if our partners fail to fund their share of any required capital contributions, we may be required to contribute that capital; 

&#8226; that venture agreements often restrict the transfer of a partner&#8217;s interest or may otherwise restrict our ability to sell the interest when we desire or on advantageous terms; 

&#8226; that our relationships with our partners are contractual in nature and may be terminated or dissolved under the terms of the agreements and, in each event, we may not continue to own or operate the interests or assets underlying the relationship or may need to purchase these interests or assets at an above-market price to continue ownership; 

&#8226; that disputes between us and our partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business; and 

&#8226; that we may in certain circumstances be liable for our partner&#8217;s actions. 

We depend on our management team, particularly our president and chief executive officer, and the loss of one of these key personnel or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel could adversely affect our business. 

Our future success depends on the continuing efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel, including Mr. Zalatoris, our president and chief executive officer. We rely on the leadership, knowledge, and experience that our executive officers provide. They foster our corporate culture, which has been instrumental to our ability to attract and retain new talent. Personnel turnover, including changes in our management team or failure to manage executive succession effectively, could disrupt our business. We have entered into the CEO Agreement with Mr. Zalatoris to compensate him for performing services as our president and chief executive officer. The term of the CEO Agreement, as amended, began on February 1, 2024 and ends on February 2, 2026, and the CEO Agreement may be terminated by us at any time for &#8220;Cause,&#8221; as defined in the CEO Agreement, immediately upon written notice of termination to Mr. Zalatoris, or at any time by us other than for Cause or by Mr. Zalatoris for any reason or no reason upon ninety (90) days&#8217; written notice. Additionally, we have a right to terminate the CEO Agreement if we close or complete a &#8220;Liquidity Event&#8221; as defined in the CEO Agreement, as amended. Future leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty in, or a disruption to, our business, and may increase the likelihood of senior management or key personnel turnover. 

We rely on IREIC and its affiliates and subsidiaries to manage and conduct our operations. Any material adverse change in IREIC&#8217;s financial condition or our relationship with IREIC could have a material adverse effect on our business and ability to achieve our investment objectives, and we may incur substantial costs if we decide to terminate this relationship. 

We depend on IREIC and its affiliates and subsidiaries to manage and conduct our operations. IREIC, through one or more of its subsidiaries, owns and controls our Business Manager and Real Estate Manager, and we would incur substantial costs to terminate our business management agreement with our Business Manager, which would include our Business Manager&#8217;s right to be paid the business management fee for the remainder of the term of the agreement (through March 31, 2027) using the calculations made for the calendar quarter in which the agreement was terminated. The right to this payment will be triggered upon a merger or sale of the Company. The Business Manager is also entitled to receive an incentive fee if a Qualifying Internalization as defined in the business management agreement occurs. IREIC and its affiliates are under no obligation to waive or otherwise reduce any fees or amounts to which it or they are entitled. Further, IREIC and its affiliates or subsidiaries may from time to time be parties to litigation or other claims arising from sponsoring other entities or providing these services. As such, IREIC and these other entities may incur costs, liabilities or other expenses arising from litigation or claims that are either not reimbursable or not covered by insurance. Future waivers or deferrals of fees, additional capital contributions or costs, liabilities or other expenses arising from litigation or claims could have a material adverse effect on IREIC&#8217;s financial condition and ability to fund our Business Manager or Real Estate Manager to the extent necessary. 

In addition, governmental and societal attention to environmental, social, and governance (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) matters, including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence and disclosure on ESG topics such as climate change, carbon emissions, water usage, waste management, human capital and risk oversight, could expand the nature, scope and complexity of matters that we or IREIC is required to control, assess and report. We may face reputational damage in the event that we or IREIC do not satisfy the corporate responsibility standards set by various constituencies, which may negatively impact our tenants and our ability to lease our properties to tenants. If we or IREIC elects not to or are unable to satisfy new ESG criteria or do not meet the criteria of a specific third-party provider, some investors or tenants may conclude that our policies with respect to corporate responsibility are inadequate. If we or IREIC fails to satisfy the expectations of investors, tenants and other stakeholders or our initiatives are not executed as planned, our reputation and financial results could be adversely affected. 

&#160; 

We may be unable to retain key personnel if we were to internalize our management functions. 

We are externally managed and have no employees. One potential outcome of the review of strategic alternatives is the possible decision by our board to internalize our management functions in lieu of engaging the Business Manager and its affiliates including the Real Estate Manager. Doing so would expose us to the risk of being unable to hire certain key employees of the Business Manager and its affiliates, even if we exercise certain rights to solicit these persons under the provisions contained in the business management agreement. Failure to hire or retain key personnel could result in increased costs and deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting. These deficiencies could cause us to incur additional costs and divert management&#8217;s attention from most effectively managing our investments, which could result in us being sued and incurring litigation-associated costs in connection with the internalization transaction. In addition, the costs that we would incur to internalize our management functions may be substantial including amounts due the Business Manager if the business management agreement is terminated including a fee in one lump sum for the remainder of the term ending on March, 31, 2027 plus any incentive fee to which the Business Manager might be entitled in the event of &#8220;Qualifying Internalization&#8221; as defined in the business management agreement. We would also lose the benefit of the experience of our Business Manager. 

Further, if we seek to internalize the functions performed for us by our Real Estate Manager, the purchase price will be separately negotiated by our independent directors, or a committee thereof, and will not be subject to the transition procedures described in our business management agreement. 

Our stockholders&#8217; return on investment in our common stock may be reduced if we are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. 

The Company is not registered, and does not intend to register itself or any of its subsidiaries, as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#8220;Investment Company Act&#8221;). If we become obligated to register the Company or any of its subsidiaries as an investment company, the registered entity would have to comply with regulation under the Investment Company Act with respect to capital structure (including the registered entity&#8217;s ability to use leverage), management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons (as defined in the Investment Company Act) and portfolio composition, including disclosure requirements and restrictions with respect to diversification and industry concentration, and other matters. Compliance with the Investment Company Act would limit our ability to make certain investments and require us to significantly restructure our operations and business plan. The costs we would incur and the limitations that would be imposed on us as a result of such compliance and restructuring would negatively affect the value of our common stock, our ability to make distributions and the sustainability of our business and investment strategies. 

We intend to continue conducting our operations, directly and through wholly or majority-owned subsidiaries, so that neither we nor our subsidiaries are registered or will be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Section 3(a)(1) of the Investment Company Act, in relevant part, defines an investment company as (i) any issuer that is, or holds itself out as being, engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities, or (ii) any issuer that is engaged, or proposes to engage, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns, or proposes to acquire, &#8220;investment securities&#8221; having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis, which we refer to as the &#8220;40% test.&#8221; The term &#8220;investment securities&#8221; generally includes all securities except government securities and securities of majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exemption from the definition of investment company under Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. We believe we are not considered an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act because we do not engage primarily or hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Rather, we and our subsidiaries are primarily engaged in the business of investing in real property. We also conduct our operations and the operations of our subsidiaries in a manner designed so that we do not come within the definition of an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(C) because less than 40% of the value of our adjusted total assets on an unconsolidated basis consist of &#8220;investment securities.&#8221; This requirement limits the types of businesses in which we may engage through our subsidiaries. Furthermore, the assets we and our subsidiaries may originate or acquire are limited by the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the rules and regulations promulgated under the Investment Company Act, which may adversely affect our business. 

If we or any of our wholly or majority-owned subsidiaries would ever inadvertently fall within one of the definitions of &#8220;investment company,&#8221; we intend to rely on the exemption from registration as an investment company pursuant to Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act, which is available for entities &#8220;primarily engaged&#8221; in the business of &#8220;purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate.&#8221; As reflected in no-action letters, the SEC staff's position on Section 3(c)(5)(C) generally requires that at least 55% of an entity&#8217;s assets comprise qualifying real estate assets and that at least 80% of its assets must comprise qualifying real estate assets and real estate-related assets under the Investment Company Act. Specifically, we expect any of our subsidiaries relying on Section 3(c)(5)(C) to invest at least 55% of its assets in mortgage loans, certain mezzanine loans and other interests in real estate that constitute qualifying real estate assets in accordance with SEC staff guidance, and an additional 25% of its assets in other types of mortgages, securities of REITs and other real estate-related assets such as debt and equity securities of companies primarily engaged in real estate businesses and securities issued by pass-through entities of which substantially all of the assets consist 

&#160; 

of qualifying real estate assets and/or real estate-related assets. The remaining 20% of the entity&#8217;s assets can consist of miscellaneous assets. These criteria may limit what we buy, sell and hold. 

We classify our assets for purposes of Section 3(c)(5)(C) based in large measure upon no-action letters issued by the SEC staff and other interpretive guidance provided by the SEC and its staff or on our analysis of such guidance published with respect to other types of assets to determine which assets are qualifying real estate assets and real estate-related assets. However, the SEC&#8217;s guidance was issued in accordance with factual situations that may be substantially different from the factual situations we may encounter. No assurance can be given that the SEC will concur with how we classify our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries. The SEC may in the future take a view different than or contrary to our analysis with respect to the types of assets we have determined to be qualifying real estate assets or real estate-related assets. For example, on August 31, 2011 the SEC issued a concept release and request for comments regarding the Section 3(c)(5)(C) exemption (Release No. IC-29778) in which it contemplated the possibility of issuing new rules or providing new interpretations of the exemption that might, among other things, define the phrase &#8220;liens on and other interests in real estate&#8221; or consider sources of income in determining a company&#8217;s &#8220;primary business.&#8221; To the extent that the SEC or its staff provides more specific or different guidance, we may be required to adjust our strategy accordingly. Any additional guidance from the SEC or its staff could provide additional flexibility to us, or it could further inhibit our ability to pursue the strategies we have chosen. If we are required to re-classify our assets, we may no longer be in compliance with the exclusion from the definition of an &#8220;investment company&#8221; provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act. There can be no assurance that the laws and regulations governing the Investment Company Act status of REITs, including the SEC or its staff providing more specific or different guidance regarding these exemptions, will not change in a manner that adversely affects our operations. 

Certain of our subsidiaries may rely on the exemption provided by Section 3(c)(6) to the extent that they hold mortgage assets through majority-owned subsidiaries that rely on the exemption provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C). The SEC staff has issued little interpretive guidance with respect to Section 3(c)(6) and any guidance published by the staff could require us to adjust our strategy accordingly. 

A change in the value of any of our assets could cause us to fall within the definition of &#8220;investment company&#8221; and negatively affect our ability to be free from registration and regulation under the Investment Company Act. To avoid being required to register the Company or any of its subsidiaries as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be unable to sell assets we would otherwise want to sell and may need to sell assets we would otherwise wish to retain. Sales may be required during adverse market conditions, and we could be forced to accept a price below that which we would otherwise consider appropriate. In addition, we may have to acquire additional income- or loss-generating assets that we might not otherwise have acquired or may have to forgo opportunities to acquire interests in companies that we would otherwise want to acquire and would be important to our investment strategy. Furthermore, if the value of securities issued by our subsidiaries that are exempted from the definition of &#8220;investment company&#8221; by Sections 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act, together with any other investment securities we own, exceeds 40% of our adjusted total assets on an unconsolidated basis, or if one or more of such subsidiaries fail to maintain an exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act, we could, among other things, be required to substantially change the manner in which we conduct our operations to avoid being required to register as an investment company, effect sales of our assets in a manner that, or at a time when, we would not otherwise choose to do so or register as an investment company. Any of these activities could negatively affect the value of our common stock, our ability to make distributions and the sustainability of our business and investment strategies, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

If we were required to register the Company or any of its subsidiaries as an investment company but failed to do so, we or the applicable subsidiary would be prohibited from engaging in our or its business, and criminal and civil actions could be brought against us or the applicable subsidiary. In addition, our contracts would be unenforceable unless a court required enforcement, and a court could appoint a receiver to take control of us and liquidate our business. 

We are subject to risks associated with a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of a contagious disease, which can cause severe disruptions in the U.S., and global economy. 

Another pandemic in the future could have repercussions across many sectors and areas of the global economy and financial markets, leading to significant adverse impacts on economic activity as well as significant volatility and lack of liquidity in financial markets, including commercial lending markets. COVID-19 impacted, and new variants or other potential pandemics could impact, in-person commerce impacting the revenues generated by our tenants and their ability to pay their rent to us when due. We may also potentially experience a negative impact on the health of our personnel, particularly if a significant number of them are impacted, which could result in a deterioration in our ability to ensure business continuity during this disruption. 

Additionally, a continuing or permanent impact resulting from a pandemic on the retail business could make it difficult for us to renew or re-lease our properties at rental rates equal to or above historical rates. We could also incur more significant re-leasing costs, and the re-leasing process could take longer. Because substantially all of our income is derived from rentals of commercial real property, our business, income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and ability to comply with the terms of, draw upon or increase the size of our credit facility (the &#8220;Credit Facility,&#8221;) prospects and ability to service our debt obligations, our ability to 

&#160; 

consummate future property acquisitions and our ability to pay future distributions to our stockholders could be materially adversely affected if a significant number of tenants become unable to meet their obligations to us as a result of another pandemic. 

Risks Related to Investments in Real Estate 

There are inherent risks with real estate investments. 

Investments in real estate assets are subject to varying degrees of risk. For example, an investment in real estate cannot generally be quickly sold, limiting our ability to promptly vary our portfolio in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions. Investments in real estate assets also are subject to adverse changes in general economic conditions which, for example, reduce the demand for rental space. 

Among the factors that could impact our real estate assets and the value of an investment in us are: 

&#8226; local conditions such as an oversupply of space or reduced demand for properties of the type that we acquire; 

&#8226; inability to collect rent from tenants; 

&#8226; vacancies or inability to rent space on favorable terms; 

&#8226; inflation and other increases in operating costs, including insurance premiums, utilities and real estate taxes; 

&#8226; adverse changes in the federal, state or local laws and regulations applicable to us, including those affecting rents, zoning, prices of goods, fuel and energy consumption, water and environmental restrictions; 

&#8226; the relative illiquidity of real estate investments; 

&#8226; changing market demographics; 

&#8226; an inability to acquire and finance real estate assets on favorable terms, if at all; 

&#8226; acts of God, such as earthquakes, floods, fires or other uninsured losses; and 

&#8226; changes or increases in interest rates and availability of financing. 

In addition, events affecting economic conditions in the United States or globally, such as the general negative performance of the real estate sector or market volatility (including as a result of uncertainties regarding actual and potential shifts in U.S. and foreign trade, economic and other policies, including with respect to treaties and tariffs, inflationary pressures or higher interest rates, actual or perceived instability in the U.S. banking system and related bank failures, ongoing hostilities between Israel and Hamas and between Russia and Ukraine, NATO and the international community&#8217;s response thereto and other geopolitical events affecting the financing markets generally), could result in a decline in economic growth generally or in the retail sector particularly and thus the demand for retail space and the rent existing or potential tenants are able or willing to pay as well as the potential for increased defaults under existing leases. 

Our real estate assets and other investments may be subject to impairment charges. 

We assess in accordance with GAAP whether there are any indicators that the value of our real estate properties and other investments may be impaired and have in the past recognized impairment charges on several properties then held for sale. Under GAAP, a property&#8217;s value is impaired only if the estimate of the aggregate future cash flows to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property. The valuation and possible subsequent impairment of real estate properties and other investments is a significant estimate that can change based on our continuous process of analyzing each property and reviewing assumptions about inherently uncertain factors, as well as the economic condition of the property at a particular point in time. We are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of our real estate properties and other investments. 

Determining whether a property is impaired and, if impaired, the amount of write-down to fair value requires a significant amount of judgment by management and is based on the best information available to management at the time of evaluation. There can be no assurance that we will not take charges in the future related to the impairment of our assets. Because the strategic plan contemplates asset sales, we have recognized, and may continue to recognize, greater impairment charges than if we were to continue to hold and operate these properties. Any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the charge is taken. 

&#160; 

The continued shift in retail sales towards e-commerce may have an adverse impact on our tenants and our business. 

Retailers are increasingly affected by e-commerce and changes in customer buying habits, which were further accelerated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the delivery or curbside pick-up of items ordered online. Retailers are considering these e-commerce trends when making decisions regarding their brick and mortar stores and how they will compete and innovate in a rapidly changing e-commerce environment. Many retailers in our shopping centers provide services or sell goods that are unable to be performed online (such as fitness centers) or that have historically been less likely to be purchased online (such as grocery stores); however, the continuing increase in e-commerce sales (including online orders for immediate delivery or pickup in store) may cause retailers to adjust the size or number of retail locations in the future or close stores. Certain of our grocery tenants are also incorporating e-commerce concepts through home delivery or curbside pickup, which could reduce foot traffic at our properties and reduce the demand for space at these properties. While we devote considerable effort and resources to analyze and respond to tenant trends, preferences and consumer spending patterns, we cannot predict with certainty what future tenants will want, what future retail spaces will look like and how much revenue will be generated at traditional &#8220;brick and mortar&#8221; locations. If we are unable to anticipate and respond promptly to trends in the market (such as space for a drive through or curbside pickup), our occupancy levels and rental amounts and the value of our properties may decline. 

We face significant competition in the leasing market, which may decrease or prevent increases in the occupancy and rental rates of our properties. 

As of December 31, 2024, we owned 52 properties located in 24 states. We compete with numerous developers, owners and operators of commercial properties, many of which own properties similar to, and in the same market areas as, our properties. If our competitors offer space at rental rates below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, for example, as a result of decreased demand for space, we may lose existing or potential tenants and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge in order to attract new tenants or retain existing tenants when their leases expire. To the extent we are unable to renew leases or re-let space as leases expire, it would result in decreased cash flow from tenants and reduce the income produced by our properties. Excessive vacancies (and related reduced shopper traffic) at one of our properties may hurt sales of other tenants at that property and may discourage them from renewing leases. Also, if our competitors develop additional properties in locations near our properties, there may be increased competition for creditworthy tenants, which may require us to make capital improvements to properties that we would not have otherwise made. 

We depend on tenants for our revenue, and accordingly lease terminations, tenant default, and bankruptcies have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect the income produced by our properties. 

The success of our investments depends on the financial stability of our tenants. Economic conditions, such as the decreased demand for certain products or services, high inflation and high interest rates, have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our tenants. Business failures and downsizings may contribute to reduced consumer demand for retail products and services which would impact tenants of our retail properties. In addition, our retail shopping center properties typically are anchored by large, nationally recognized tenants that may lease space at more than one of our properties, and any of these tenants may experience a downturn in their business that may weaken significantly their financial condition. Further, mergers or consolidations among large retail establishments could result in the closure of existing stores or duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations, which could include tenants at our retail properties. 

As a result of these factors, our tenants may delay lease commencements, decline to extend or renew their leases upon expiration, fail to make rental payments, or declare bankruptcy. Any of these actions could result in the termination of the tenants&#8217; leases, the expiration of existing leases without renewal, or the loss of rental income attributable to the terminated or expired leases. In the event of a tenant default or bankruptcy, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as a landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment and re-leasing our property. 

Our reliance on single or significant tenants, such as big-box or anchor tenants, at certain properties may decrease our ability to lease vacated space and adversely affect the returns we earn. 

In the retail sector, a tenant occupying all or a large portion of the gross leasable area of a retail center, commonly referred to as an anchor tenant, may become insolvent, may suffer a downturn in business, for example, because of increased competition from internet retailers, or may decide not to renew its lease. For example, REI vacated 26,500 square feet, at Settlers Ridge in February 2021 and that space remains vacant. This vacancy and similar events at other properties have resulted and could result again in a reduction or cessation in rental payments to us and would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. A lease termination by an anchor tenant could result in lease terminations or reductions in rent by other tenants whose leases may permit cancellation or rent reduction, generally within six to twelve months following the termination of the other tenant&#8217;s lease. For example, MidTowne Shopping Center continues to be impacted by a co-tenancy failure with six tenants actively paying a reduced substitute rent in lieu of their full lease obligated payments. On November 3, 2024, American Freight filed for bankruptcy and eventually rejected and closed their location at 

&#160; 

Harris Plaza. American Freight is a named co-tenant in Ulta&#8217;s lease at this center. In addition, Ross Stores has co-tenancy rights requiring the American Freight unit to be occupied and operating. Furthermore, two additional tenants at Pentucket Shopping Center cited known co-tenancy failures in September 2024, both of these tenant&#8217;s substitute rent rights were originally triggered by the closure of Bed Bath &#38; Beyond and were effective retroactive to July 1, 2023. Similarly, the leases of some tenants may permit the tenant to transfer its lease to another retailer. Further, the transfer to a new tenant could cause customer traffic in the retail center to decrease and thereby reduce the income generated by that retail center. A lease transfer to a new tenant could also allow other tenants to make reduced rental payments or to terminate their leases in accordance with lease terms. In the event that we are unable to re-lease the vacated spaces to new qualified tenants, we may incur additional expenses in order to remodel the space to be able to re-lease the space to more than one tenant. 

We may be unable to renew expiring leases with existing tenants or re-lease spaces to new tenants on favorable terms or at all. 

Our results of operations depend to a significant degree on our ability to continue to lease our properties, including renewing expiring leases, leasing vacant space and re-leasing space in properties where leases are expiring. As of December 31, 2024, our portfolio had physical and economic occupancy of 93.1% and 93.4%, respectively, and the weighted average lease expiration for our portfolio was 4.6 years. In 2025, leases for more than 10% of our portfolio, measured by total ABR expire, and in 2026, leases for more than 9% of our portfolio, measured by total ABR expire. The existing tenants may decline to renew leases and we may not be able to find replacement tenants. We cannot guarantee that leases that are renewed or new leases will have terms that are as economically favorable to us as the expiring leases, or that substantial rent abatements, tenant improvement allowances, early termination rights or below-market renewal options will not be offered to retain tenants or attract new tenants or that we will be able to lease a property at all. We may experience significant costs in connection with re-leasing a significant number of our properties, which could materially and adversely affect us. 

Tenant bankruptcies, particularly tenants that occupy multiple spaces at our properties, may have material adverse effects on us. 

Bankruptcy filings by our tenants or any guarantor of a tenant&#8217;s lease obligation can occur in the course of operations, and in recent years, several companies in the retail industry, including certain of our tenants, have declared bankruptcy. A bankruptcy filing of our tenants or any guarantor of a tenant&#8217;s lease obligations would bar all efforts to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from these entities or their properties, unless we receive an enabling order from the bankruptcy court. Post-bankruptcy debts would be paid currently. If a lease is assumed, all pre-bankruptcy balances owing under it must be paid in full. Leases have been rejected by some tenants in the past, and if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy in the future, we would only have a general unsecured claim for damages. If a lease is rejected, it is unlikely we would receive any payments from the tenant because our claim is capped at the rent reserved under the lease, without acceleration, for the greater of one year or 15% of the remaining term of the lease, but not greater than three years, plus rent already due but unpaid. This claim could be paid only if the funds were available, and then only in the same percentages as that realized on other unsecured claims. 

A tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy has delayed and could again delay efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases, and could ultimately preclude full collection of these sums. A tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could cause a decrease or cessation of rental payments that would mean a reduction in our cash flow and the amount available for distributions to our stockholders. In the event of a bankruptcy there can be no assurance that the tenant or its trustee will assume our lease. If a given lease or guaranty of a lease is not assumed, our cash flow and the amounts available for distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected. 

An economic downturn could have an adverse impact on the retail industry generally. Slow or negative growth in the retail industry could result in defaults by retail tenants which could have an adverse impact on our financial operations. 

An economic downturn could have an adverse impact on the real estate industry generally. As a result, the retail industry could face reductions in sales revenues and increased bankruptcies. The continuation of adverse economic conditions may result in an increase in distressed or bankrupt retail companies, which in turn would result in an increase in defaults by tenants at our commercial properties. Additionally, slow economic growth is likely to hinder new entrants into the retail market which may make it difficult for us to fully lease space at our retail properties or retail properties we plan to acquire. Tenant defaults and decreased demand for retail space would have an adverse impact on the value of our retail properties and any additional retail properties we acquire and our results of operations. 

Inflation and continuing increases in the inflation rate may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

Increases in the rate of inflation, both real and anticipated, may adversely affect our net operating income from leases with stated fixed rent increases or limits on the tenant&#8217;s obligation to pay its share of operating expenses, which could be lower than the increase in inflation at any given time. Increased inflation could also increase our general and administrative expenses and, as a result of an increase in market interest rates in response to higher than anticipated inflation rate, increase our mortgage and debt interest costs, and these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rents increase. Property taxes are also impacted by inflationary changes as taxes are typically regularly reassessed in most states based on changes in the fair value of our properties. An increase in our expenses, or expenses paid 

&#160; 

or incurred by our Business Manager or its affiliates that are reimbursed by us pursuant to the Business Management Agreement, or a failure of revenues to increase at least with inflation could adversely impact our results of operations. 

Only twenty of our leases, generally limited to leases for less than 5,000 square feet, contain annual rental rate escalations based on increases in the Consumer Price Index. Some others contain fixed annual rent escalations. If the fixed rent increases begin to lag behind inflation, and our expenses increase with or greater than the inflation rate, then our profitability would be negatively impacted. Future leases may not contain escalation provisions, and even those that do include rent escalation provisions may not be sufficient to protect our revenues from the adverse effects of inflation. Moreover, if we are not able to increase rents at a rate that keeps pace with inflation, the purchasing power of the dollars that we receive will be lower that it would have been in the absence of inflation. 

Most leases require our tenant to reimburse us for the tenant&#8217;s pro rata share of certain, but not all, operating expenses, but increases in operating expenses passed through to our tenants, without a corresponding increase in our tenants&#8217; profitability, may place pressure on our ability to grow base rent as tenants look to manage their total occupancy costs. Renewals of leases or future leases for our properties may not be negotiated on a basis requiring the tenants to pay some of the operating expenses, in which event we may have to pay those costs. If we are unable to lease properties on a basis requiring the tenants to pay all or some of such expenses, or if tenants fail to pay required tax, utility and other impositions, we could be required to pay those costs. 

Inflation could also have an adverse effect on consumer spending, which may impact our tenants&#8217; sales and ability to pay rent and, with respect to those leases including percentage rent clauses, our average rents. Additionally, if inflation increases prices of properties at a rate that is greater than inflation increases rents that we can charge to tenants at those properties, this will have a negative effect on our opportunities to acquire real estate by making what would otherwise be lucrative investment opportunities less profitable to us and adversely impacting the yields on acquisitions. 

We may be restricted from re-leasing space at our retail properties by provisions such as exclusivity provisions in other tenants&#8217; leases. 

Leases with retail tenants may contain provisions giving the particular tenant the exclusive right to sell particular types of merchandise or provide specific types of services within the particular retail center. These provisions may limit the number and types of prospective tenants interested in leasing space in a particular retail property. 

We have entered into both short-term and long-term leases with some of our retail tenants. Our short-term leases may expose us to the effects of declining market rent and our long-term leases may limit our ability to adjust lease rates to fair market rental rates which may adversely affect our revenues and ultimately our ability to make distributions. 

Although as of December 31, 2024, the weighted average lease expiration for our portfolio was 4.6 years, we have entered into both short-term leases, with lease terms of fewer than three years, and long-term leases, with lease terms of greater than seven years, both of which expose us to risk. Our short-term leases expose us to the effects of declining market rent. There is no assurance that we will be able to renew these short-term leases as they expire or attract replacement tenants on comparable terms, if at all. Therefore, the returns we earn on this type of investment may be more volatile than the returns generated by properties with longer term leases. 

In contrast, long-term leases do not allow for significant changes in rental payments and do not expire in the near term. If we do not accurately judge the potential for increases in market rental rates when negotiating these long-term leases, significant increases in future property operating costs could result in receiving less than fair market rental rates from these leases. These circumstances would adversely affect our revenues and funds available for distribution. 

Retail conditions may adversely affect our income. 

A retail property&#8217;s revenues and value may be adversely affected by several factors, many of which apply to real estate investment generally, but which also include trends in the retail industry and perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of the retail property. Our properties are located in public places, and any incidents of crime or violence, including acts of protest or terrorism, would result in a reduction of business traffic to tenant stores in our properties. Any such incidents may also expose us to civil liability. In addition, to the extent that the investing public has a negative perception of the retail sector, the value of our retail properties may be negatively impacted. 

Several of our retail leases are based on tenant gross sales. Under those leases, our revenue from tenants increases as the sales of our tenants increase. Generally, retailers face declining revenues during downturns in the economy. As a result, the portion of our revenue which may derive from percentage rent leases could be adversely affected by a general economic downturn. 

&#160; 

We do not own the land when we are the lessee under a ground lease, so properties that we operate pursuant to a ground lease are subject to unique risks. 

The Company is the lessee under one long-term leasehold, commonly known as a ground lease, to operate a property that is on land owned by a third party. The ground lease, which commenced on July 1, 2007, was assumed as part of a property purchased in October 2015 and extends through June 30, 2037 with six 5-year renewal options which the Company assumes will be exercised. Although we have a right to use the property on land leased to us pursuant to a ground lease, we do not own the underlying land. Accordingly, we will have no economic interest in the land at the expiration of the ground lease and will not share in any increase in value of the land or the improvements once our ground lease ends. If we are found to be in breach of a ground lease, and that breach cannot be cured, we could lose our interest in the improvements and the right to operate the property. Further, because we do not own the underlying land, the lessor could take certain actions to disrupt our use of the property or our tenant&#8217;s operation of the property. 

Operating expenses have increased, and may continue to increase in the future and to the extent these increases cannot be passed on to our tenants, our cash flow and our operating results would decrease. 

Operating expenses, such as expenses for fuel, utilities, labor, building materials and insurance, are not fixed and may fluctuate from time to time. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in February 2025 that the consumer price index, a commonly referenced measure of inflation, rose by 3.0% over the 12 months ended January 2025. Unless specifically provided for in a lease, there is no guarantee that we will be able to pass increases on to our tenants. To the extent these increases cannot be passed on to our tenants, any increases would cause our cash flow and our operating results to decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to pay or sustain distributions. 

An increase in real estate taxes may decrease our income from properties. 

Some local real property tax assessors may seek to reassess some of our properties as a result of our acquisition of the property. Generally, from time to time our property taxes will increase as property values or assessment rates change or for other reasons deemed relevant by the assessors. In fact, property taxes may increase even if the value of the underlying property declines. An increase in the assessed valuation of a property for real estate tax purposes will result in an increase in the related real estate taxes on that property. Although some tenant leases may permit us to pass through the tax increases to the tenants for payment, there is no assurance that renewal leases or future leases will be negotiated on the same basis. Increases not passed through to tenants will adversely affect our cash flow from operations and our ability to pay distributions. 

To the extent we engage in development or redevelopment activities, construction delays and resulting increased costs and risks may reduce cash flow from operations. 

We have acquired, and may again acquire, unimproved real property or properties that are under development or construction. Investments in these properties are subject to the uncertainties generally associated with real estate development and construction, including those related to re-zoning land for development, environmental concerns of governmental entities or community groups and the developers&#8217; ability to complete the property in conformity with plans, specifications, budgeted costs and timetables. If a developer fails to perform, we may resort to legal action to rescind the purchase or the construction contract or to compel performance. A developer&#8217;s performance may also be affected or delayed by conditions beyond the developer&#8217;s control. Delays in completing construction could also give tenants the right to terminate leases. We may incur additional risks when we make periodic progress payments or other advances to developers before they complete construction. Despite management&#8217;s planning and cost-mitigation efforts, inflation could have an effect on our construction costs necessary to complete development and redevelopment projects. Additionally, labor shortages and supply chain issues could extend the time to completion. These and other factors can result in increased costs of a project or loss of our investment. In addition, we will be subject to lease-up risks associated with newly constructed projects. We also must rely on rental income and expense projections and estimates of the fair market value of property upon completion of construction when agreeing upon a purchase price at the time we acquire the property. If our projections are inaccurate, we may pay too much for a property, and the return on our investment could suffer. 

Uninsured losses or premiums for insurance coverage may adversely affect our returns. 

The nature of the activities at certain properties may expose us and our tenants or operators to potential liability for personal injuries and, in certain instances, property damage claims. In addition, there are types of losses, generally catastrophic in nature, such as losses due to wars, acts of terrorism, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, pollution or environmental matters that are uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may be insured subject to limitations, such as large deductibles or co-payments. Insurance risks associated with potential terrorist acts or increasingly severe weather has increased, and may continue to increase, the premiums we pay for coverage against property and casualty claims. During the year ended December 31, 2024, total property operating expenses increased, including as a result of an increase in insurance premium costs compared to 2023. These policies may or may not be available at a 

&#160; 

reasonable cost, if at all, which could inhibit our ability to finance or refinance our properties. In such instances, we may be required to provide other financial support, either through financial assurances or self-insurance, to cover potential losses. We cannot provide any assurance that we will have adequate coverage for these losses. In the event that any of our properties incurs a casualty loss that is not fully covered by insurance, the value of the particular asset will likely be reduced by the uninsured loss. In addition, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to fund any uninsured losses. 

The costs of complying with environmental laws and other governmental laws and regulations may adversely affect us. 

All real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. These laws and regulations generally govern water usage, wastewater discharges, air emissions, the operation and removal of underground and above-ground storage tanks, the use, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, and the remediation of contamination associated with disposals. We also are required to comply with various local, state and federal fire, health, life-safety and similar regulations. Some of these laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability on tenants, owners or operators for the costs of investigating or remediating contaminated properties. These laws and regulations often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. The cost of removing or remediating could be substantial. In addition, the presence of these substances, or the failure to properly remediate these substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent a property or to use the property as collateral for borrowing. 

Environmental laws and regulations also may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures by us. Environmental laws and regulations provide for sanctions in the event of noncompliance and may be enforced by governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, by private parties. Third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances. Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws may require material expenditures by us. For example, various federal, regional and state laws and regulations have been implemented or are under consideration to mitigate the effects of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions. Among other things, &#8220;green&#8221; building codes may seek to reduce emissions through the imposition of standards for design, construction materials, water and energy usage and efficiency, and waste management. These requirements could increase the costs of maintaining or improving our existing properties or developing new properties and could also result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions that could adversely impact the businesses of our tenants and their ability to pay rent. 

We own certain properties in regions that are particularly susceptible to natural disasters, which may make us susceptible to the effects of these natural disasters in those areas from adverse climate developments or other causes. 

Our properties are located in certain geographical areas that may be impacted by adverse events such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires, earthquakes, blizzards or other natural disasters, which could cause a loss of revenues at our real estate properties. In addition, according to some experts, global climate change could result in heightened severe weather, thus further impacting these geographical areas. Natural disasters in these areas may cause damage to our properties beyond the scope of our insurance coverage, thus requiring us to make substantial expenditures to repair these properties and resulting in a loss of revenues from these properties. Any properties located near either coast will be exposed to more severe weather than properties located inland. These losses may not be insured or insurable at an acceptable cost. Elements such as water, wind, hail, fire damage and humidity in these areas can increase or accelerate wear on the properties&#8217; weatherproofing and mechanical, electrical and other systems, and cause mold issues over time. As a result, we may incur additional operating costs and expenditures for capital improvements at properties in these areas. 

Our properties may contain or develop harmful mold, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediating the problem. 

The presence of mold at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly program to remediate, contain or remove the mold. Mold growth may occur when moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing because exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. The presence of mold could expose us to liability from our tenants, their employees and others if property damage or health concerns arise. 

We may incur significant costs to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act or similar laws. 

Our properties generally are subject to the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, which we refer to as the Disabilities Act. Under the Disabilities Act, all places of public accommodation are required to comply with federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. The Disabilities Act has separate compliance requirements for &#8220;public accommodations&#8221; and &#8220;commercial facilities&#8221; that generally require that buildings and services be made accessible and available to people with disabilities. 

&#160; 

The requirements of the Disabilities Act could require removal of access barriers and could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, monetary penalties or, in some cases, an award of damages. We attempt to acquire properties that comply with the Disabilities Act or place the burden on the seller or other third party, such as a tenant, to ensure compliance with these laws. However, we cannot assure our stockholders that we will be able to acquire properties or allocate responsibilities in this manner. We may incur significant costs to comply with these laws. 

Risks Associated with Debt Financing 

The financial covenants under our credit agreement may restrict our ability to make distributions and our operating and acquisition activities. If we breach the financial covenants we could be held in default under the credit agreement, which could accelerate our repayment date and materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. 

We entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement in February 2022 for a $475.0 million Credit Facility consisting of a revolving credit facility providing initial revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount of $200.0 million (the &#8220;Revolving Credit Facility&#8221;) and a term loan facility providing initial term loan commitments in an aggregate amount of $275.0 million (the &#8220;Term Loan&#8221;). On May 17, 2022, we entered into a First Amendment to Credit Agreement Regarding Incremental Term Loans (the &#8220;First Amendment&#8221;), amending the terms of the Credit Agreement primarily to draw an additional $300.0 million to fund the acquisition of investment properties during May 2022 discussed in &#8220;Note 4 &#8211; Acquisitions.&#8221; The credit agreement provides us with the ability from time to time to increase the size of the Credit Facility in an amount not to exceed $1.2 billion, subject to certain conditions. Our performance of the obligations under the credit agreement, including the payment of any outstanding indebtedness, is secured by a minimum pool of 15 unencumbered properties with an unencumbered pool value of $300.0 million or above and by a guaranty by certain of our subsidiaries. As of both March 5, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we had $125 million outstanding of the $200 million available under the Revolving Credit Facility. Our maximum availability under the Revolving Credit Facility was $75 million as of both March 5, 2025 and December 31, 2024, subject to the terms and conditions, including compliance with the covenants, of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement that governs the Credit Facility. Although $75 million is the maximum available, covenant limitations, particularly the leverage ratio, affect what we can actually draw. As of both March 5, 2025 and December 31, 2024, approximately $39 million is available to draw as additional debt under the Revolving Credit Facility. By &#8220;additional debt,&#8221; we mean debt in addition to existing debt such as existing mortgages. The properties comprising the borrowing base for the Credit Facility are not available to be used as collateral for other debt unless removed from the borrowing base, which would reduce availability under the Credit Facility. Under the terms of the credit agreement, our leverage ratio generally cannot exceed 65%. As of December 31, 2024, our leverage ratio was 57%. There has been substantially less available to actually draw or undertake as additional debt than the maximum amount available, and there may be additional periods during which the amount we can actually draw or otherwise incur as additional debt is considerably less than the maximum amount available, for example, if new variants of the coronavirus, high inflation or high interest rates were to negatively affect our tenants. 

The credit agreement requires compliance with certain financial covenants, including, among other conditions, a Consolidated Tangible Net Worth requirement, restrictions on indebtedness, a distribution limitation and other material covenants. Compliance with these covenants could inhibit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and to pursue certain business initiatives or effect certain transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us. For example, without lender consent, we may not declare and pay distributions or honor any redemption requests if any default under the agreement then exists or if distributions, excluding any distributions reinvested through our DRP, for the then-current quarter and the three immediately preceding quarters would exceed 95% of our Funds from Operations, or &#8220;FFO,&#8221; excluding acquisition expenses, or &#8220;adjusted FFO,&#8221; for that period. 

The credit agreement provides for several customary events of default, including, among other things, the failure to comply with our covenants under the credit agreement, such as the &#8220;Consolidated Tangible Net Worth&#8221; covenant as defined in the credit agreement, and the failure to pay when amounts outstanding under the credit agreement become due or defaulting by us or our subsidiaries in the payment of an amount due under, or in the performance of any term, provision or condition contained in, any agreement providing for another debt arrangement, such as a mortgage, beyond certain dollar thresholds specified in our Credit Facility. Tenant bankruptcies negatively impact our compliance with the Consolidated Tangible Net Worth covenant even if the tenant continues to pay rent. There is no guarantee that our lenders under the credit agreement will grant another waiver of this covenant or any other covenant that we might be in danger of violating or required representation that we cannot make. Any merger, sale of assets, consolidation or change of control may constitute a default under the credit agreement. Defaults under the credit agreement could restrict our ability to borrow additional monies and could cause all amounts to become immediately due and payable, which would materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. 

&#160; 

Volatility in the financial markets and challenging economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to secure debt financing on attractive terms and our ability to service any future indebtedness that we may incur. 

We have funded our capital needs almost exclusively through cash flow from operations (to the extent positive) and through draws on the Credit Facility, if needed. The domestic and international commercial real estate debt markets have been volatile resulting in increases in interest rates or changes in the expected or anticipated rate of decline and, from time to time, the tightening of underwriting standards by lenders and credit rating agencies, which limits the availability of credit and increase costs for what is available. We may also face a heightened level of interest rate risk, for example, if the U.S. Federal Reserve Board increases interest rates or decreases the pace of any reductions in response to, among other things, changing inflationary expectations. All these actions will likely lead to increases in our borrowing costs and may impact our ability to access capital on favorable terms, in a timely manner, or at all, which could adversely affect our ability to obtain funding for our capital needs, such as future acquisitions. If the overall cost of borrowing increases, either by increases in the index rates or by increases in lender spreads, the increased costs may result in existing or future acquisitions generating lower overall economic returns and potentially reducing future cash flow available to us. Volatility in the debt markets may negatively impact our ability to borrow monies to finance the purchase of, or other activities related to, real estate assets. In addition, we may find it difficult, costly or impossible to refinance indebtedness which is maturing. If we are unable to borrow monies on terms and conditions that we find acceptable, the return on our properties may be lower. 

Further, economic conditions could negatively impact commercial real estate fundamentals and result in lower occupancy, lower rental rates and declining values in our real estate portfolio and in the collateral securing any loan investments we may make. 

Borrowings may reduce the funds available for distribution and increase the risk of loss since defaults may cause us to lose the properties securing the loans and may result in defaults under other agreements, including our Credit Facility. 

We have acquired properties by either borrowing monies or, in some instances, by assuming existing financing. We typically borrow money to finance a portion of the purchase price of assets we acquire. In some instances, we have acquired properties by borrowing monies in an amount equal to the purchase price of the acquired properties. We may also borrow money for other purposes to, among other things, satisfy the requirement that we distribute at least 90% of our &#8220;REIT annual taxable income,&#8221; subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gain, or as is otherwise necessary or advisable to assure that we continue to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Over the long term, however, payments required on any amounts we borrow reduce the funds available for, among other things, acquisitions, capital expenditures for existing properties or distributions to our stockholders because cash otherwise available for these purposes is used to pay principal and interest on this debt. 

If there is a shortfall between the cash flow from a property and the cash flow needed to service mortgage debt secured by a property, then the amount of cash flow from operations available for distributions to stockholders will be reduced. Many of the mortgages on our properties contain provisions which under certain circumstances require that cash received from tenants be paid into a cash maintenance escrow account or a lockbox or other account controlled by the lender, for example, when the borrower is not in compliance with certain covenants in the mortgage. In addition, incurring mortgage debt increases the risk of loss since defaults on indebtedness secured by a property may result in lenders initiating foreclosure actions. In such a case, we could lose the property securing the loan that is in default, thus reducing the value of our investments. For federal income tax purposes, a foreclosure is treated as a sale of the property or properties for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the property or properties. If the outstanding balance of the debt exceeds our tax basis in the property or properties, we would recognize taxable gain on the foreclosure action and we would not receive any cash proceeds. In this event, we may be unable to pay the amount of distributions required in order to maintain our REIT status. We also may fully or partially guarantee any monies that subsidiaries borrow to purchase or operate properties. In these cases, we will likely be responsible to the lender for repaying the loans if the subsidiary is unable to do so. Our Credit Facility contains a cross-default provision that could be triggered if certain defaults by our subsidiary borrowers were to occur under their mortgages, and mortgages themselves could contain cross-collateralization or cross-default provisions, so the Company or more than one property may be materially adversely affected by a mortgage default. 

Interest-only indebtedness may increase our risk of default and may reduce our funds available for other needs including distributions to our stockholders. 

We have obtained, and may continue to enter into, mortgage indebtedness that does not require us to pay principal for all or a portion of the life of the debt instrument. During the period when no principal payments are required, the amount of each scheduled payment is less than that of a traditional amortizing mortgage loan. The principal balance of the mortgage loan is not reduced (except in the case of prepayments) because there are no scheduled monthly payments of principal required during this period. After the interest-only period, we may be required either to make scheduled payments of principal and interest or to make a lump-sum or &#8220;balloon&#8221; payment at or prior to maturity. These required principal or balloon payments will increase the amount of our scheduled payments and may increase our risk of default under the related mortgage loan if we do not have funds available or are unable to refinance the obligation. 

&#160; 

We may acquire or finance properties with lock-out provisions, which may prohibit us from selling a property, or may require us to maintain specified debt levels for a period of years on some properties. 

The terms and conditions contained in certain of our loan documents preclude us from pre-paying the principal amount of the loan or could restrict us from selling or otherwise disposing of or refinancing properties. For example, lock-out provisions prohibit us from reducing the outstanding indebtedness secured by certain of our properties, refinancing this indebtedness on a non-recourse basis at maturity, or increasing the amount of indebtedness secured by our properties. Lock-out provisions could impair our ability to take other actions during the lock-out period. In particular, lock-out provisions could preclude us from participating in major transactions that could result in a disposition of our assets or a change in control even though that disposition or change in control might be in the best interests of our stockholders. 

Increasing interest rates could increase the amount of our debt payments. 

We have obtained debt that requires us to pay interest on amounts we borrow at variable or &#8220;adjustable&#8221; rates. Increases in interest rates will increase our interest costs. If interest rates are higher when we refinance our loans, our expenses will increase and we may not be able to pass on this added cost in the form of increased rents, thereby reducing our cash flow and the amount available for distribution to our stockholders. Further, during periods of rising interest rates, we may be forced to sell one or more of our properties in order to repay existing loans, which may not permit us to maximize the return on the particular properties being sold. As of December 31, 2024, we had $175 million of debt, or 21% of our total debt, bearing interest at variable rates indexed to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;SOFR&#8221;) and not fixed by a swap with a weighted average interest rate equal to 6.31% per annum. We had variable rate debt indexed to SOFR and subject to swap agreements fixing the rate of $551 million or 66% of our total debt as of December 31, 2024. If interest rates on all debt which bears interest at variable rates as of December 31, 2024 increased by 1% (100 basis points), the increase in interest expense on all debt would decrease earnings and cash flows by $1.8 million annually. If interest rates on all debt which bears interest at variable rates as of December 31, 2024 decreased by 1% (100 basis points), interest expense would increase earnings and cash flows by the same amount. 

To hedge against interest rate fluctuations, we may use derivative financial instruments that may be costly and turn out to be ineffective. 

From time to time, we have used, and may continue to use, derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates on loans secured by our assets. Derivative instruments may include interest rate swap contracts, interest rate cap or floor contracts, futures or forward contracts, options or repurchase agreements. Our actual hedging decisions will be determined in light of the facts and circumstances existing at the time of the hedge and may differ from our current hedging strategy. There is no assurance that our hedging strategy will achieve our objectives. We may be subject to costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs, if we terminate these arrangements. 

We use derivative financial instruments to hedge against interest rate fluctuations and are exposed to credit risk, basis risk and legal enforceability risks. In this context, credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. If the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes us, which creates credit risk for us. Basis risk occurs when the index upon which the contract is based is more or less variable than the index upon which the hedged asset or liability is based, thereby making the hedge less effective. Finally, legal enforceability risks encompass general contractual risks including the risk that the counterparty will breach the terms of, or fail to perform its obligations under, the derivative contract, increasing the risk that we may not realize the benefits of these instruments. There is a risk that counterparties could fail, shut down, file for bankruptcy or be unable to pay out contracts. The failure of a counterparty that holds collateral that we post in connection with an interest rate swap agreement could result in the loss of that collateral. 

Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest 

IREIC may face a conflict of interest in allocating personnel and resources between its affiliates, our Business Manager and our Real Estate Manager. 

We do not have any employees. We rely on persons performing services for our Business Manager and Real Estate Manager and their affiliates to manage our day-to-day operations. Some of these persons also provide services to one or more investment programs currently or previously sponsored by IREIC. These individuals face competing demands for their time and service, and are required to allocate their time between our business and assets and the business and assets of IREIC, its affiliates and the other programs formed and organized by IREIC. Certain of these individuals have fiduciary duties to both us and our stockholders. If these persons are unable to devote sufficient time or resources to our business due to the competing demands of the other programs, they may violate their fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders, which could harm our business and cause us to be unable to maintain or increase the value of our assets, and our operating cash flows and ability to pay distributions could be adversely affected. 

&#160; 

In addition, if another investment program sponsored by IREIC decides to internalize its management functions in the future, it may do so by hiring and retaining certain of the persons currently performing services for our Business Manager and Real Estate Manager, and if it did so, it would not allow these persons to perform services for us. 

We do not have arm&#8217;s-length agreements with our Business Manager, our Real Estate Manager or any other affiliates of IREIC. 

The agreements and arrangements with our Business Manager, our Real Estate Manager and any other affiliates of IREIC were not negotiated at arm&#8217;s-length. These agreements may contain terms and conditions that are not in our best interest or would not be present if we entered into arm&#8217;s-length agreements with third parties. 

Our Business Manager, our Real Estate Manager and other affiliates of IREIC face conflicts of interest caused by their compensation arrangements with us, which could result in actions that are not in the long-term best interests of our stockholders. 

We pay fees, which may be significant, to our Business Manager, Real Estate Manager and other affiliates of IREIC for services provided to us. Our Business Manager receives fees based on the aggregate book value, including acquired intangibles, of our invested assets and is entitled to receive its business management fee for the remainder of the term ending March 31, 2027 in one lump sum upon termination of the business management agreement by the Company except for cause or upon a Liquidity Event (as defined in the Fourth Business Management Agreement). Further, our Real Estate Manager receives fees based on the gross income from properties under management and may also receive leasing and construction management fees. Other parties related to, or affiliated with, our Business Manager or Real Estate Manager may also receive fees or cost reimbursements from us. These compensation arrangements may cause these entities to take or not take certain actions. For example, these arrangements may provide an incentive for our Business Manager to: (1) borrow more money than prudent to increase the amount we can invest; or (2) retain instead of sell assets, even if our stockholders may be better served by a sale or other disposition of the assets. The interests of these parties in receiving fees may conflict with the interest of our stockholders in earning income on their investment in our common stock. 

We rely on entities affiliated with IREIC to identify real estate assets. 

We rely on the real estate professionals employed by IREA and other affiliates of our Sponsor to source potential investments in properties, real estate-related assets and other investments in which we may be interested. Our Sponsor and its affiliates maintain an investment committee (&#8220;Investment Committee&#8221;) that reviews each potential investment and determines whether an investment is acceptable for acquisition. In determining whether an investment is suitable, the Investment Committee considers investment objectives, portfolio and criteria of all programs currently advised by our Sponsor or its affiliates (collectively referred to as the &#8220;Programs&#8221;). Other factors considered by the Investment Committee may include cash flow, the effect of the acquisition on portfolio diversification, the estimated income or unrelated business tax effects of the purchase, policies relating to leverage, regulatory restrictions and the capital available for investment. Our Business Manager will not recommend any investments for us unless the investment is approved for consideration in advance by the Investment Committee. Once an investment has been approved for consideration by the Investment Committee, the Programs are advised and provided an opportunity to elect to acquire the investment. If more than one Program is interested in acquiring an investment, then the Program that has had the longest period of time elapse since it was allocated and invested in a contested investment is awarded the investment by the allocation committee. We may not, therefore, be able to acquire properties that we otherwise would be interested in acquiring. 

Our properties may compete with the properties owned by other programs sponsored by IREIC or IPC. 

Certain programs sponsored by IREIC or its subsidiary, Inland Private Capital Corporation (&#8220;IPC&#8221;), own and manage the type of properties that we own or seek to acquire, including in the same geographical areas. Therefore, our properties, especially those located in the same geographical area, may compete for tenants or purchasers with other properties owned and managed by other IREIC- or IPC-sponsored programs. Persons performing services for our Real Estate Manager may face conflicts of interest when evaluating tenant leasing opportunities for our properties and other properties owned and managed by IREIC- or IPC-sponsored programs, and these conflicts of interest may have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain tenants. In addition, a conflict could arise in connection with the resale of properties in the event that we and another IREIC- or IPC-sponsored program were to attempt to sell similar properties at the same time, including in particular in the event another IREIC- or IPC-sponsored program engages in a liquidity event at approximately the same time as us, thus impacting our ability to sell the property or complete a proposed liquidity event. 

&#160; 

Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure 

Our rights, and the rights of our stockholders, to recover claims against our officers, directors, Business Manager and Real Estate Manager are limited. 

Under our charter, no director or officer will be liable to us or to any stockholder for money damages to the extent that Maryland law permits the limitation of the liability of directors and officers of a corporation. We generally indemnify our directors, officers, employees, if any, Business Manager, Real Estate Manager and their respective affiliates for any losses or liabilities suffered by any of them. As a result, we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors, officers and employees, our Business Manager, the Real Estate Manager and their respective affiliates, than might otherwise exist under common law. In addition, we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors, officers and employees or our Business Manager and the Real Estate Manager and their respective affiliates in some cases. 

Our charter places limits on the amount of common stock that any person may own without the prior approval of our board of directors. 

No more than 50% of the outstanding shares of our common stock may be beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of each taxable year (other than the first taxable year for which an election to be a REIT has been made). Our charter prohibits any persons or groups from owning more than 9.8% in value of our outstanding stock or more than 9.8% in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of our outstanding common stock without the prior approval of our board of directors. These provisions may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us, including an extraordinary transaction such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that might involve a premium price for holders of our common stock. Further, any person or group attempting to purchase shares exceeding these limits could be compelled to sell the additional shares and, as a result, to forfeit the benefits of owning the additional shares. 

We have a classified board, which may discourage a third party from acquiring us in a manner that might result in a premium price to our stockholders. 

Our board of directors is divided into three classes of directors. At each annual meeting, directors of one class are elected to serve until the annual meeting of stockholders held in the third year following the year of their election and until their successors are duly elected and qualify. The classification of our board of directors may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire us and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any transaction that could result from such offers, even if the acquisition would be in our stockholders' best interests, and may therefore prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium price for their stock in connection with a change in control of us, including an extraordinary transaction (such as a merger, tender offer or sale of all or substantially all our assets). 

Maryland law limits, in some cases, the ability of a third party to vote shares acquired in a &#8220;control share acquisition.&#8221; 

The Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act provides that &#8220;control shares&#8221; of a Maryland corporation acquired in a &#8220;control share acquisition&#8221; have no voting rights except to the extent approved by stockholders by a vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. Shares of stock owned by the acquirer, by officers of the acquirer or by employees who are directors of the acquirer, are excluded from shares entitled to vote on the matter. &#8220;Control shares&#8221; are voting shares of stock which, if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned by the acquirer or in respect of which the acquirer can exercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing directors within specified ranges of voting power. Control shares do not include shares the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval. A &#8220;control share acquisition&#8221; means the acquisition of issued and outstanding control shares. The control share acquisition statute does not apply: (1) to shares acquired in a merger, consolidation or share exchange if the Maryland corporation is a party to the transaction; or (2) to acquisitions approved or exempted by the charter or bylaws of the Maryland corporation. Our bylaws contain a provision exempting from the Control Share Acquisition Act any and all acquisitions of our stock by any person. There can be no assurance that this provision will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future. 

Federal Income Tax Risks 

If we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, our operations and distributions to stockholders will be adversely affected. 

We elected to be taxed as a REIT, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2013 and intend to operate in a manner that would allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, we may terminate our REIT qualification, if our board of directors determines that not qualifying as a REIT is in the best interests of our stockholders, or inadvertently. Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. We have structured and intend to continue structuring our activities in a manner designed to satisfy all the requirements for qualification as a REIT. However, the REIT qualification requirements are extremely complex and interpretation of the U.S. federal income tax laws governing qualification as a REIT is limited. Furthermore, 

&#160; 

any opinion of our counsel, including tax counsel, as to our eligibility to remain qualified as a REIT is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (the &#8220;IRS&#8221;) and is not a guarantee that we will continue to qualify as a REIT. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in operating so we can remain qualified as a REIT. Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends on our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals. Our compliance with the REIT income or quarterly asset requirements also depends on our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, if certain of our operations were to be recharacterized by the IRS, such recharacterization would jeopardize our ability to satisfy all requirements for qualification as a REIT. Furthermore, future legislative, judicial or administrative changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws could be applied retroactively, which could result in our disqualification as a REIT. 

If we were to fail to remain qualified as a REIT, without the benefit of certain statutory relief provisions, in any taxable year: 

&#8226; we would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to stockholders when computing our taxable income; 

&#8226; we would be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income as a regular &#8220;C corporation&#8221; and may be subject to additional state and local taxes; 

&#8226; we would be disqualified from being taxed as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we failed to qualify, unless entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions; 

&#8226; we would have less cash to pay distributions to stockholders; and 

&#8226; we may be required to borrow additional funds or sell some of our assets in order to pay corporate tax obligations we may incur as a result of being disqualified. 

In addition, if we were to fail to qualify as a REIT, we would not be required to pay distributions to stockholders, and all distributions to stockholders that we did pay would be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. This means that our U.S. stockholders who are taxed as individuals generally would be taxed on our dividends at capital gains rates and that our corporate stockholders would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends, subject, in each case, to applicable limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. 

In certain circumstances, we may be subject to federal, state and local income taxes as a REIT, which would reduce our cash available to pay distributions. 

Even as a REIT, we may be subject to federal, state and local income taxes. For example, if we have net income from a &#8220;prohibited transaction,&#8221; we will incur taxes equal to the full amount of the net income from the prohibited transaction. We may not be able to make sufficient distributions to avoid excise taxes applicable to REITs. We also may decide to retain income we earn from the sale or other disposition of our property and pay income tax directly on this income. In that event, our stockholders would be treated as if they earned that income and paid the tax on it directly. However, stockholders that are tax-exempt, such as charities or qualified pension plans, would have to file income tax returns to receive a refund of the income tax paid on their behalf. We also may be subject to state and local taxes on our income, property or net worth, either directly or at the level of the other companies through which we indirectly own our assets. Any taxes we pay directly or indirectly will reduce our cash available to pay distributions. 

The taxation of distributions paid to our stockholders can be complex. 

Distributions that we make to our taxable stockholders out of current and accumulated earnings and profits (and not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income) generally will be taxable as ordinary income. Noncorporate stockholders are entitled to a 20% deduction with respect to these ordinary REIT dividends which would result in a maximum effective federal income tax rate of 29.6% (or 33.4% including the 3.8% surtax on net investment income); however, the 20% deduction will end after December 31, 2025. However, a portion of our distributions may: (1) be designated by us as capital gain dividends generally taxable as long-term capital gain to the extent that they are attributable to net capital gain recognized by us; (2) be designated by us as qualified dividend income, taxable at capital gains rates, generally to the extent they are attributable to dividends we receive from any taxable REIT subsidiaries or certain other taxable &#8220;C corporations&#8221; in which we own shares of stock; or (3) constitute a return of capital generally to the extent that they exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A return of capital is not taxable but has the effect of reducing the tax basis of a stockholder&#8217;s investment in our common stock. Distributions that exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits and a stockholder&#8217;s tax basis in our common stock generally will be taxable as capital gain. 

&#160; 

To maintain our REIT status, we must meet annual distribution requirements, which may force us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities or borrow funds during unfavorable market conditions. This could delay or hinder our ability to meet our investment objectives and reduce our stockholders&#8217; overall return. 

To qualify as a REIT, we must distribute to our stockholders each year at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed REIT taxable income and net capital gain and to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on any amount by which distributions we make with respect to any calendar year are less than the sum of (a) 85% of our ordinary income, (b) 95% of our capital gain net income and (c) 100% of our undistributed income from prior years. At times, we may not have sufficient funds to satisfy these distribution requirements and may need to borrow funds or sell assets to fund these distributions, maintain our REIT status and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes. 

Certain of our business activities are potentially subject to the prohibited transaction tax. 

Our ability to dispose of property during the first two years following acquisition is restricted to a substantial extent as a result of our REIT status. Under applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code regarding prohibited transactions by REITs, while we qualify as a REIT and provided we do not meet a safe harbor available under the Internal Revenue Code, we will be subject to a 100% penalty tax on the net income from the sale or other disposition of any property (other than foreclosure property) that we own, directly or indirectly through any subsidiary entity, but generally excluding taxable REIT subsidiaries, that is deemed to be inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. Whether property is inventory or otherwise held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business depends on the particular facts and circumstances surrounding each property. We intend to avoid the 100% prohibited transaction tax by (1) conducting activities that may otherwise be considered prohibited transactions through a taxable REIT subsidiary (but such taxable REIT subsidiary will incur corporate rate income taxes with respect to any income or gain recognized by it), (2) conducting our operations in such a manner so that no sale or other disposition of an asset we own, directly or indirectly through any subsidiary, will be treated as a prohibited transaction or (3) structuring certain dispositions of our properties to comply with the requirements of the prohibited transaction safe harbor available under the Internal Revenue Code for properties that, among other requirements, have been held for at least two years. Despite our present intention, no assurance can be given that any particular property we own, directly or indirectly through any subsidiary entity, but generally excluding taxable REIT subsidiaries, will not be treated as inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. 

Complying with the REIT requirements may force us to liquidate otherwise attractive investments. 

To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, certain government securities and qualified real estate assets, including shares of stock in other REITs, certain mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. The remainder of our investment in securities (other than securities that qualify for the 75% asset test and securities of qualified REIT subsidiaries and taxable REIT subsidiaries) generally cannot exceed 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer, 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer, or 5% of the value of our assets as to any one issuer. In addition, no more than 25% of the value of our total assets may be securities (other than securities that qualify for the 75% asset test and securities of qualified REIT subsidiaries), no more than 20% of the value of our total assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries and no more than 25% of our assets may be represented by publicly offered REIT debt instruments that do not otherwise qualify under the 75% asset test. In order to meet these tests, we may be required to forego investments we might otherwise make. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our performance. 

If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within thirty days after the end of the calendar quarter, or otherwise qualify to cure the failure under a relief provision, to avoid losing our REIT status and suffering adverse tax consequences. As a result, we may be required to liquidate otherwise attractive investments. 

&#160; 

Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively. 

The REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code may limit our ability to hedge the risks inherent to our operations. Under current law, any income that we generate from derivatives or other transactions intended to hedge risk of interest rate changes, price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings made, or to be made, to acquire or carry real estate assets or in certain cases to hedge previously acquired hedges entered into to manage risks associated with property that has been disposed of or liabilities that have been extinguished, if properly identified under applicable Treasury Regulations, generally will not constitute gross income for purposes of the 75% and 95% income requirements applicable to REITs. To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions will likely be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests. As a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a taxable REIT subsidiary. This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because taxable REIT subsidiaries would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear. In addition, losses in a taxable REIT subsidiary generally will not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward against future taxable income of such taxable REIT subsidiary. 

Legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect investors. 

Changes to the tax laws may occur, and any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our shares or on the market value or the resale potential of our assets. Our stockholders are urged to consult with an independent tax advisor with respect to the status of legislative, regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our shares. 

Although REITs generally receive more favorable tax treatment than entities taxed as &#8220;C corporations,&#8221; it is possible that future legislation would result in a REIT having fewer tax advantages, and it could become more advantageous for a company that invests in real estate to elect to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a &#8220;C corporation.&#8221; As a result, our charter provides our board of directors with the power, under certain circumstances, to revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election and cause us to be taxed as a &#8220;C corporation,&#8221; without the vote of our stockholders. Our board of directors has fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders and could only cause such changes in our tax treatment if it determines in good faith that such changes are in the best interest of our stockholders. 

Dividends payable by REITs generally do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends . 

Currently, the maximum tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income payable to U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates is 23.8%, including the 3.8% surtax on net investment income. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for this reduced rate and, as described above, through December 31, 2025, will be subject to an effective rate of 33.4%, including the 3.8% surtax on net investment income. Although this does not adversely affect the taxation of REITs or dividends payable by REITs, the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals, trusts and estates to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs, including our shares. Tax rates could be changed in future legislation. 

General Risks 

Our stockholders may have tax liability on distributions that they elect to reinvest in our common stock. 

Distributions that are reinvested through the DRP are deemed received by stockholders that participate in the DRP for income tax purposes and are taxable based on the fair market value of the share of our common stock reinvested. As a result, unless a stockholder is a tax-exempt entity, it will have to use funds from other sources to pay its tax liability. 

The occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in our cybersecurity, could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information, and/or damage to our business relationships, all of which could negatively impact our financial results. 

A cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our information resources. More specifically, a cyber incident is an intentional attack or an unintentional event that can include gaining unauthorized access to systems to disrupt operations, corrupt data, or steal confidential information. As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our systems, both internal and those we have outsourced. Our three primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include operational interruption, damage to our relationship with our tenants, and private data exposure. We have implemented processes, procedures and controls to help mitigate these risks, but these measures, as well as our increased awareness of a risk of a cyber incident, do not guarantee that our financial results will not be negatively impacted by such an incident. 

&#160; 

Failure by us, our Business Manager or our service providers (including our transfer agent) or tenants to implement effective information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities could disrupt our business and harm our results of operations. 

We, the Business Manager and our service providers (including our transfer agent) or tenants are dependent on the effectiveness of our respective information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities to protect our computer and telecommunications systems and the data that resides on or is transmitted through them. An externally caused information security incident, such as a hacker attack, virus or worm, or an internally caused issue, such as failure to control access to sensitive systems or insufficient policies or procedures, could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential information and could result in material financial loss, loss of competitive position, regulatory actions, breach of contracts, reputational harm or legal liability. 

Our operations may be subject to an increasing number of cyber incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. 

Our success depends in part on our ability to provide effective cybersecurity protection in connection with our business, and the digital technologies and internal digital infrastructure we utilize. We operate information technology networks and systems for internal purposes that incorporate third-party software and technologies. We also connect to and exchange data with external networks that may be operated by the Business Manager, service providers (including our transfer agent), tenants, or other third parties. We may also utilize software and other digital products and services that store, retrieve, manipulate, and manage our information and data, external data, personal data of our Business Manager, service providers (including our transfer agent), tenants, stockholders or other third parties, and our own information and data. 

Our digital technologies, as well as third-party products, services and technologies that we rely on, are subject to the risk of cyberattacks and, given the nature of such attacks, some incidents can remain undetected for a period of time despite efforts to detect and respond to them in a timely manner. Cyberattacks are expected to accelerate on a global basis in both frequency and magnitude as threat actors are becoming increasingly sophisticated in using techniques and tools (including artificial intelligence) that circumvent controls, evade detection and even remove forensic evidence of the infiltration. There can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect material consequences arising from such incidents or attacks, or to avoid a material adverse impact on our systems after such incidents or attacks do occur. We have experienced and will continue to experience varying degrees of cyber events in the normal conduct of our business, including defending against attacks from social engineering such as phishing. Even if we successfully defend our own digital technologies and internal digital infrastructure, we also rely on providers of third-party products, services, and networks, with whom we may share data, and who may be unable to effectively defend their digital technologies, services and internal digital infrastructure against attack. 

Unauthorized access to or modification of, or actions disabling our ability to obtain authorized access to data of our Business Manager, service providers (including our transfer agent), tenants, stockholders or other third parties, other external data, personal data, or our own data, as a result of a cyber incident, attack or exploitation of a security vulnerability, or loss of control of our operations could result in significant damage to our reputation or disruption to our business and to our Business Manager, service providers (including our transfer agent), tenants, or other third parties. In addition, allegations, reports, or concerns regarding vulnerabilities affecting our digital products or services could damage our reputation. This could lead to fewer using our services, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and future prospects. 

In addition, if our systems or third-party products, services, and network systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove to be insufficient, we could be adversely affected by, among other things, loss of or damage to any of our intellectual property, proprietary or confidential information; loss of data or disruption to our Business Manager, service providers (including the transfer agent), tenants, or other third parties; breach of personal data; interruption of our business operations; increased legal and regulatory exposure, including fines and remediation costs; and increased costs required to prevent, respond to, or mitigate cybersecurity attacks. These risks could harm our reputation and our relationships with our employees (if any), our Business Manager, service providers, tenants, stockholders or other third parties, and may result in claims against us. 

&#160; 

Disruptions in our information technology systems or a compromise of security with respect to our systems could adversely affect our operating results by limiting our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations, adjust to changing market conditions, or implement strategic initiatives. 

We rely on our Business Manager&#8217;s information technology systems to be able to monitor and control our operations, adjust to changing market conditions, and implement strategic initiatives, and, in connection with our use of these systems, we rely on the cybersecurity strategy and policies implemented by Inland. Any disruptions in these systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could in the future adversely affect, our ability to access and use certain applications and could, depending on the nature and magnitude of the problem, adversely affect our operating results by limiting our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations, adjust to changing market conditions and implement strategic initiatives. We cannot guarantee that disruptions will not be material in the future. In addition, the security measures we employ to protect our systems have in the past not detected or prevented, and may in the future not detect or prevent, all attempts to hack our systems, denial-of-service attacks, viruses, malicious software (malware), employee error or malfeasance, phishing attacks, security breaches, disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware or integrating systems of acquired assets or other attacks and similar disruptions that may jeopardize the security of information stored in or transmitted by the sites, networks and systems that we otherwise maintain, which include cloud-based networks and data center storage. 

We have, from time to time, experienced threats to our data and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks in the normal course of business. Our Business Manager is continuously developing and enhancing our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage, or unauthorized access. This continued development and enhancement requires us to expend resources. However, we may not anticipate or combat all types of future attacks until after they have been launched. If any of these breaches of security occur or are anticipated in the future, we could be required to expend additional capital and other resources, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Our response to attacks, and our investments in our technology and our controls, processes and practices, may not be sufficient to shield us from significant losses or liability. Further, given the increasing sophistication of bad actors and complexity of the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or disable systems, a breach or attack could potentially persist for an extended period of time before being detected. As a result, we may not be able to anticipate the attack or respond adequately or timely, and the extent of a particular incident, and the steps that we may need to take to investigate the incident, may not be immediately clear. It could take a significant amount of time before an investigation can be completed and full, reliable information about the incident becomes known. During an investigation, it is possible we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how to remediate it, which could further adversely impact us, and new regulations could result in us being required to disclose information about a material cybersecurity incident before it has been mitigated or resolved, or even fully investigated. We also face cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on internet technology, which could strain our technology resources or create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. 

We may become subject to greater liability due to changing regulations and laws regarding cybersecurity, which could materially adversely affect our business, operations, results of operations and profitability. 

Because our systems sometimes retain information about our Business Manager, service providers (including our transfer agent), tenants, stockholders or other third parties, our failure to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold, whether as a result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others, could in the future lead, to disruptions in our services or other data systems, and could lead to unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information or corruption of data. Our failure to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold could also violate applicable privacy, data security and other laws and subject us to lawsuits, fines and other means of regulatory enforcement. Regulators have been imposing new data privacy and security requirements, including new and greater monetary fines for privacy violations. These laws and regulations may be broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations and increasing enforcement, and we may incur costs to monitor compliance and alter our practices. Moreover, certain new and existing data privacy laws and regulations could diverge and conflict with each other in certain respects, which makes compliance increasingly difficult. Complying with new regulatory requirements could require us to incur substantial expenses or require us to change our business practices, either of which could harm our business. As regulators have become increasingly focused on information security, data collection and use and privacy, we may be required to devote significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security controls and to identify and remediate vulnerabilities, which could adversely impact our results of operations and profitability. Any compromise or breach of our systems could result in adverse publicity, harm our reputation, lead to claims against us and affect our relationships with our Business Manager, service providers (including our transfer agent), tenants, stockholders or other third parties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, results of operations and profitability. 

A failure of our Business Manager&#8217;s information technology (IT) infrastructure could adversely impact our business and operations. 

We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our Business Manager&#8217;s information technology infrastructure and its ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to changing needs of our business. Our Business Manager faces the challenge of supporting older systems and hardware and implementing necessary upgrades to its IT infrastructure. Our Business Manager 

&#160; 

may not be able to successfully implement these upgrades in an effective manner, which could adversely affect our operations. In addition, our Business Manager may incur significant increases in costs and extensive delays in the implementation and rollout of any upgrades or new systems. If there are technological impediments, unforeseen complications, errors or breakdowns in implementation, the disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 

If our Business Manager or Real Estate Manager lose or are unable to obtain key or other skilled personnel, our ability to implement our investment strategies could be hindered. 

Our success depends to a significant degree upon the contributions of certain of our executive officers and other key personnel that we engage, such as Mr. Zalatoris, or that we access through our Business Manager and Real Estate Manager. The CEO Agreement, as amended, that we have entered into with Mr. Zalatoris has a term ending February 2, 2026, subject to renewal. Neither the Business Manager nor the Real Estate Manager has employment agreements with any of the other persons that serve as executive officers of the Company, the Business Manager or the Real Estate Manager. We cannot guarantee that all, or any of these persons, will continue to be available to provide services to us. If any of these individuals were to cease their employment or other relationship with our Business Manager or Real Estate Manager, respectively, our results and ability to pursue our business plan could suffer. Further, we do not intend to separately maintain &#8220;key person&#8221; life insurance that would provide us with proceeds in the event of death or disability of these persons. We believe our future success depends, in part, upon the ability of our Business Manager and Real Estate Manager to hire and retain highly skilled managerial, operational and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and we cannot assure our stockholders that our Business Manager or Real Estate Manager will be successful in attracting and retaining skilled personnel. If our Business Manager or Real Estate Manager loses or is unable to obtain the services of key or other skilled personnel due to, among other things, an overall labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or increased labor costs, or as a result of other general macroeconomic factors, our ability to implement our investment strategies could be delayed or hindered, and a perception of reduced management capabilities could cause the market value of our investments to decline. 

The failure of any bank in which we deposit our funds could reduce the amount of cash we have available to fund our capital and operating needs and distributions. 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or &#8220;FDIC,&#8221; generally only insures limited amounts per depositor per insured bank. The FDIC insures up to $250,000 per depositor per insured bank account. We have cash and cash equivalents at banks exceeding these federally insured levels. If any of the banking institutions in which we have deposited funds ultimately fail, we may lose our deposits over the federally insured levels. The loss of our deposits would reduce the amount of cash we have available to fund our capital and operating needs and distributions. 

Actual or threatened terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the markets in which we operate our business and our profitability. 

We may own or acquire properties located in areas that are susceptible to attack or damage. These attacks may directly impact the value of our assets through damage, destruction, loss or increased security costs. Although we may obtain terrorism insurance, we may not be able to obtain sufficient coverage to fund any losses we may incur. Risks associated with potential acts of terrorism could sharply increase the premiums we pay for coverage against property and casualty claims. Further, certain losses resulting from these types of events are uninsurable or not insurable at reasonable costs. More generally, any actual or threatened terrorist attack, other act of violence or war, including armed conflicts, could result in increased volatility in, or damage to, the United States and worldwide financial markets and economy.

&#160;

OPERATIONAL RISKS

&#160;

We may be unable to keep pace with rapidly changing technology in wind turbine and other industrial component manufacturing. 

&#160;

The global markets for wind turbines and our other manufactured industrial components are rapidly evolving technologically. Our component manufacturing equipment and technology may not be suited for future generations of products being developed by wind turbine companies. As turbines grow in size, particularly to support the development of offshore windfarms, tower manufacturing becomes more complicated and may require investments in new manufacturing equipment. For example, some wind turbine manufacturers are using wind turbine towers made partially or wholly from concrete instead of steel. Additionally, we continue to evaluate the implementation of emerging technologies such as generative artificial intelligence and machine learning into our products and services. Such technologies present unique business opportunities along with rapidly changing legal and regulatory risks, and we may not be able to anticipate vulnerabilities, flaws or security threats resulting from the use of such technology and develop adequate protection measures. To maintain a successful business in our field, we must keep pace with technological developments and the changing standards of our customers and potential customers and meet their constantly evolving demands. If we fail to adequately respond to the technological changes in our industry, make the necessary capital investments or are not suited to provide components for new types of wind turbines, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.

&#160;

We are substantially dependent on a few significant customers and the ordering levels for our products may vary based on customer needs. Further, we face significant risks associated with changes in our relationship with these significant customers. 

&#160;

Historically, the majority of our revenues are highly concentrated with a limited number of customers. Some of the markets we serve have a limited number of customers. In 2024, one customer, GE Vernova, accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues, and our five largest customers accounted for 73% of our consolidated revenues. Certain of our customers have periodically expressed their intent to scale back, delay or restructure existing customer agreements, which has led to reduced revenues from these customers and periodic deviations in expected ordering levels. It is possible that this may occur again in the future. Additionally, not all of our customers make purchases every year. As a result, our operating profits and gross margins have historically been negatively affected by significant variability in production levels, which has created production volume inefficiencies in our operations and cost structures. Because of this variability, we believe that comparisons of our operating results in any particular quarterly period may not be a reliable indicator of future performance.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Additionally, if our relationships with our significant customers should change materially, it could be difficult for us to immediately and profitably replace lost sales in a market with such concentration, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results. We could be adversely impacted by decreased customer demand for our products due to (i) the impact of current or future economic conditions on our customers, (ii) our customers&#8217; loss of market share to their competitors that do not use our products, and (iii) our loss of market share with our customers. We could lose market share with our customers to our competitors or to our customers themselves, should they decide to become more vertically integrated and produce the products that we currently provide.

&#160;

In addition, even if our customers continue to do business with us, we could be adversely affected by a number of other potential developments with our customers. For example:

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679;

The inability or failure of our customers to meet their contractual obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and in the event of a dispute, these customers may have more significant resources than we do, which could result in protracted litigation and the incurrence of material costs.

##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679;

Certain customer contracts provide the customer with the opportunity to cancel a substantial portion of its volume obligation by providing us with notice of such election prior to commencement of production. Such contracts generally require the customer to pay a sliding cancellation fee based on how far in advance of commencement of production such notice is provided.

##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679;

If we are unable to deliver products to our customers in accordance with an agreed-upon schedule, we may become subject to liquidated damages provisions in certain supply agreements for the period of time we are unable to deliver finished products. Although the liquidated damages provisions are generally capped, they can become significant and may have a negative impact on our profit margins and financial results.

##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679;

A material change in payment terms with a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our short-term cash flows. 

&#160; &#9679; The concentration of our customer base may enable our customers to demand pricing and other terms unfavorable to us and make us more vulnerable to changes in demand by or issues with a given customer. ##TABLE_END &#160;

Because our industry is capital intensive and we have significant fixed and semi-fixed costs, our profitability is sensitive to changes in volume. 

&#160;

The property, plants and equipment needed to manufacture products for our customers and provide our processes and solutions can be very expensive. We must spend a substantial amount of capital to purchase and maintain such property, plant and equipment. Although we believe our current cash balance, along with our projected internal cash flows and available financing sources, will provide sufficient cash to support our currently anticipated operating and capital needs, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to purchase and maintain the property, plant and equipment necessary to operate our business, we may be required to reduce or delay planned capital expenditures or to incur additional indebtedness.

&#160;

We face significant risks associated with uncertainties resulting from changes to policies and laws with the periodic changes in the U.S. administration. 

&#160;

Changes of administration in the U.S. federal government may affect our business in a manner that currently cannot be reliably predicted, especially given the potentially significant changes to various laws and regulations that affect us. These uncertainties may include changes in laws and policies in areas such as corporate taxation, taxation and tariffs on imports of internationally sourced products, international trade including trade treaties such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, environmental protection and workplace safety laws, labor and employment law, immigration and health care. For example, President Trump has indicated that his administration is likely to impose significant tariffs on imported goods. The imposition of such tariffs may strain international trade relations or impact costs of raw materials. Additionally, an advisory commission, the &#8220;Department of Government Efficiency&#8221; was announced to reform federal government processes and reduce expenditures. Pressures on and uncertainty surrounding the U.S. federal government&#8217;s budget, and potential change in budgetary priorities could adversely affect individual programs and delay purchasing or payment decisions by certain of our customers. All of these uncertainties may individually or in the aggregate materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

&#160;

Disruptions in the supply of parts and raw materials, or changes in supplier relations, may negatively impact our operating results. 

&#160;

We are dependent upon the supply of certain raw materials used in our production process, and these raw materials are exposed to price fluctuations on the open market. Raw material costs for materials such as steel, our primary raw material, have fluctuated significantly and may continue to fluctuate. To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, we have generally tried to match raw material purchases to our sales contracts or incorporated price adjustment clauses in our contracts. However, limitations on availability of raw materials or increases in the cost of raw materials (including steel), energy, transportation and other necessary services may impact our operating results if our manufacturing businesses are not able to fully pass on the costs associated with such increases to their respective customers. Alternatively, we will not realize material improvements from any decline in steel prices as the terms of our contracts generally require that we pass these cost savings through to our customers. In addition, we may encounter supplier constraints, be unable to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relations or be affected by disruptions in the supply chain caused by events such as natural disasters, pandemics, shipping delays, power outages and labor strikes. Additionally, our supply chain has become more global in nature and, thus, more complex from a shipping and logistics perspective. In the event of limitations on availability of raw materials or significant changes in the cost of raw materials, particularly steel, our margins and profitability could be negatively impacted.

&#160;

We rely on unionized labor, the loss of which could adversely affect our future success. 

&#160;

We depend on the services of unionized labor and have collective bargaining agreements with certain of our operations workforce at our Cicero, Illinois and Neville Island, Pennsylvania Gearing facilities. The loss of the services of these and other personnel, whether through terminations, attrition, labor strike or otherwise, or a material change in our collective bargaining agreements, including a significant increase in labor costs, could have a material adverse impact on us and our future profitability. In November 2022, a four-year collective bargaining agreement was ratified by the collective bargaining union in our Neville Island facility and will remain in effect through October 2026. A four-year collective bargaining agreement in regard to the Cicero, Illinois facility was negotiated in February 2022, and is expected to remain in effect through February 2026. Any failure to negotiate and conclude a new collective bargaining agreement with a union when the applicable agreement expires could result in strikes, boycotts, or other labor disruptions. As of December 31, 2024, these collective bargaining units represented approximately 18% of our workforce.

&#160;

Our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel at competitive cost could adversely affect our business. 

&#160;

Many of the products we sell, and related services that we provide require that we have skilled labor in our manufacturing facilities. The availability of labor in the markets in which we operate has declined in recent years and competition for such labor has increased, especially under current inflationary pressures. A significant increase in wages paid by competitors, both within and outside the energy industry, for such work force could result in insufficient availability of workers or increase our labor costs, or both. In the event prevailing wage rates continue to increase in the markets in which we operate, we may be required to concurrently increase the wages paid to our employees to maintain the quality of our workforce and customer service. If the supply of skilled labor is constrained or our costs of attracting and maintaining a workforce increase, our profit margins could decrease, and our growth potential and brand image could be impaired.

&#160;

&#160;

If our estimates for warranty expenses differ materially from actual claims made, or if we are unable to reasonably estimate future warranty expense for our products, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. 

&#160;

We provide warranty terms generally ranging between one and five years to our customers depending upon the specific product and terms of the customer agreement. We reserve for warranty claims based on prior experience and estimates made by management based upon a percentage of our sales revenues related to such products. From time to time, customers have submitted warranty claims to us. However, we have a limited history on which to base our warranty estimates for certain of our manufactured products. Our assumptions could materially differ from the actual performance of our products in the future and could exceed the levels against which we have reserved. In some instances, our customers have interpreted the scope and coverage of certain of our warranty provisions differently from our interpretation of such provisions. The expenses associated with remediation activities in the wind energy industry can be substantial, and if we are required to pay such costs in connection with a customer&#8217;s warranty claim, we could be subject to additional unplanned cash expenditures. If our estimates prove materially incorrect, or if we are required to cover remediation expenses in addition to our regular warranty coverage, we could be required to incur additional expenses and could face a material unplanned cash expenditure, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Market disruptions and volatility may result in an increased likelihood of our customers asserting warranty or remediation claims in connection with our products that they would not ordinarily assert in a more stable economic environment. In the event of such a claim, we may incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or to engage in litigation with the affected customer regarding the claim. We maintain product liability insurance, but there can be no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against such claims. A successful claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business.

&#160;

Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business and result in the compromise of confidential information and changes in information security and privacy laws, regulations, policies and contractual obligations could adversely affect our business. 

&#160;

Our business is at risk from and may be impacted by information security incidents, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data and data systems, ransomware, malware, business email compromise, phishing attacks, and other electronic security events, which are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Such incidents can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats. They can also result from internal compromises, such as human error, or malicious acts. While we seek to employ measures to prevent, detect, and mitigate these threats, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber event. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business and compromise confidential information belonging to us and third parties.

&#160;

Certain of our suppliers and third parties we transact business with may receive information provided by us or by our customers and may also be at risk and impacted by cybersecurity incidents. If these third parties fail to adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our own and our customers&#8217; data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed. Further, these third parties may incorporate generative artificial intelligence into their operations, and these generative artificial intelligence tools may not meet existing or rapidly evolving regulatory or industry standards with respect to privacy and data protection.

&#160;

Additionally, the legal and regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy in the U.S. and international jurisdictions is constantly evolving. Violation or non-compliance with any of these laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and financial conditions, as well as subject us to significant fines, third party damages and other liability.

&#160;

See Item 1C of this Form 10-K, &#8220;Cybersecurity,&#8221; for more information on our cybersecurity risk management and governance.

&#160;

Recent increases in inflation and interest rates in the United States and elsewhere could adversely affect our business. 

&#160;

We are exposed to fluctuations in inflation and interest rates, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The United States and other jurisdictions have recently experienced high levels of inflation. If the inflation rate continues to increase, it will likely continue to affect our expenses, including, but not limited to, employee compensation and labor expenses and increased costs for supplies, and we may not be successful in offsetting such cost increases. In addition, historically we have carried a significant amount of variable rate debt which is subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Certain government agencies, including the U.S. Treasury, have previously implemented and may implement policies that have resulted and may continue to result in significantly increased interest rates and borrowing costs. Recent increases in interest rates will result in increased interest expense to the extent we cannot limit our debt balances. A severe or prolonged economic downturn, whether due to inflationary pressures, increased interest rates, or otherwise, could result in a variety of risks to our business, including weakened demand for our products.

&#160;

RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRIES

&#160;

Our financial and operating performance is subject to certain factors out of our control, including the state of the wind energy market in North America. 

&#160;

Our results of operations (like those of our customers) are subject to general economic conditions, and specifically to the state of the wind energy market. In addition to the state and federal government policies supporting renewable energy described below, the growth and development of the larger wind energy market in North America is subject to a number of factors, including, among other things:

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679;

the availability and cost of financing for the estimated pipeline of wind energy development projects;

##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679;

the cost of electricity, which may be affected by a number of factors, including government regulation, power transmission, seasonality, fluctuations in demand, and the cost and availability of fuel, particularly natural gas;

##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; the cost of raw materials used to make wind turbines, particularly steel; &#160;

&#9679;

the general increase in demand for electricity or &#8220;load growth;&#8221;

##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679;

the costs of competing power sources, including natural gas, nuclear power, solar power and other power sources;

##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679;

the development of new power generating technology, advances in existing technology or discovery of power generating natural resources;

##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679;

the development of electrical transmission infrastructure;

##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679;

state and federal laws and regulations regarding avian protection plans and noise or turbine setback requirements;

##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679;

other state and federal laws and regulations, particularly those favoring low carbon energy generation alternatives;

##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START &#160;

&#9679;

administrative and legal challenges to proposed wind energy development projects;

##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679;

the effects of global climate change such as more frequent or more extreme weather events, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, changes to ground and surface water and other related phenomena;

##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679;

the improvement in efficiency and cost of wind energy, as influenced by advances in turbine design and operating efficiencies; and

##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679;

public perception and localized community responses to wind energy projects.

##TABLE_END &#160;

Consolidation among wind turbine manufacturers could increase our customer concentration and/or disrupt our supply chain relationships. 

&#160;

Wind turbine manufacturers are among our primary customers. There has been consolidation among these manufacturers, and more consolidation may occur in the future. Customer consolidation may result in pricing pressures, leading to downward pressure on our margins and profits, and may also disrupt our supply chain relationships.

&#160;

&#160;

We face competition from industry participants who may have greater resources than we do. 

&#160;

Our businesses are subject to risks associated with competition from new or existing industry participants who may have more resources and better access to capital. Certain of our competitors and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial resources, customer support, technical and marketing resources, larger customer bases, longer operating histories, greater name recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we do. Among other things, these industry participants compete with us based upon price, quality, location and available capacity. We cannot be sure that we will have the resources or expertise to compete successfully in the future. We also cannot be sure that we will be able to match cost reductions by our competitors or that we will be able to succeed in the face of current or future competition.

&#160;

RISKS RELATED TO OUR CORPORATE STRATEGY 

&#160;

Our plans for growth and diversification may not be successful, and could result in poor financial performance. 

&#160;

We continue to seek to strategically diversify and grow the business to improve operational efficiency and meet customer demand. Our diversification efforts into natural gas turbine power generation (also known as aeroderivatives), defense, mining, precision machining, O&#38;G and other power generation markets may require additional investments in personnel, equipment and operational infrastructure. Moreover, although we have historically participated in most of these lines of business, there is no assurance that we will be able to grow our presence in these markets at a rate sufficient to compensate for a potentially weaker wind energy market. If we are unable to further penetrate these markets, our plans to diversify our operations may not be successful and our anticipated future growth may be adversely affected.

&#160;

Our growth efforts through increased production levels at existing facilities, acquisitions and continuous improvement activities such as the proper coordination and integration of the supply chain, the consistent use of systems with respect to production activities, the Advanced Product Quality Processes (APQP) to support the introduction of new products, and the hiring of continuous improvement experts to optimize our production processes, will require coordinated efforts across the Company and continued enhancements to our current operating infrastructure. If the cost of making these changes increases or if our efforts are unsuccessful, the Company may not realize anticipated benefits and our future earnings may be adversely affected.

&#160;

Our diversification outside of the wind energy market exposes us to business risks associated with the gas turbine, O&#38;G, and mining industries, among others, which may slow our growth or penetration in these markets. 

&#160;

Although we have experience in the gas turbine, O&#38;G and mining industry markets, these markets have not historically been our primary focus. In further diversifying our business to serve these markets, we face competitors who may have more resources, longer operating histories and more well-established relationships than we do, and we may not be able to successfully or profitably generate additional business opportunities in these industries. Moreover, if we are able to successfully diversify into these markets, our businesses may be exposed to risks associated with these industries, which could adversely affect our future earnings and growth. These risks include, among other things:

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160;

&#9679;

Variability in the prices and relative demand for oil, gas, minerals and other commodities;

##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START &#160; &#160; &#9679; &#160; &#160; The cyclical nature of certain markets (i.e., the O&#38;G market); &#160;

&#9679;

Changes in domestic and global political and economic conditions affecting the O&#38;G and mining industries;

##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START &#160;

&#9679;

Changes in technology;

##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START &#160;

&#9679;

Changes in the price and availability of alternative fuels and energy sources and changes in energy consumption or supply; and

##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START &#160;

&#9679;

Changes in federal, state and local regulations, including, among other regulations, relating to hydraulic fracturing and greenhouse gas emissions.

##TABLE_END &#160;

&#160;

If our projections regarding the future market demand for our products are inaccurate, our operating results and our overall business may be adversely affected. 

&#160;

We have previously made significant capital investments in anticipation of rapid growth in the U.S. wind energy market. However, the growth in the U.S. wind energy market has not kept pace with our expectations when some of these capital investments were made, and there can be no assurance that the U.S. wind energy market will grow and develop in a manner consistent with our expectations, or that we will be able to fill our capacity through the further diversification of our operations. Our internal manufacturing capabilities have required significant upfront capital costs. If market demand for our products does not increase at the pace we have anticipated and align with our manufacturing capacity, we may be unable to offset these costs and achieve economies of scale, and our operating results may continue to be adversely affected by high fixed costs, reduced margins and underutilization of capacity which may prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability. In light of these considerations, we may be forced to reduce our labor force and production to minimum levels, as was done at certain operating locations in the past, temporarily idle existing capacity or sell to third parties manufacturing capacity that we cannot utilize in the near term, in addition to the steps that we have already taken to adjust our capacity more closely to demand. Alternatively, if we experience rapid increased demand for our products in excess of our estimates, or we reduce our manufacturing capacity, our installed capital equipment and existing workforce may be insufficient to support higher production volumes, which could adversely affect our customer relationships and overall reputation. In addition, we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a timely manner, procure adequate resources or locate suitable third-party suppliers to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers, and our business could be adversely affected. Our ability to meet such excess customer demand could also depend on our ability to raise additional capital and effectively scale our manufacturing operations.

&#160;

Additionally, most of our customers do not commit to long-term contracts or firm production schedules, and accordingly, we frequently experience volatile lead-times in customer orders. Additionally, customers may change production quantities or delay production with little advance notice. Therefore, we rely on and plan our production and inventory levels based on our customers&#8217; advance orders, commitments and/or forecasts, as well as our internal assessments and forecasts of customer demand. The variations in volume and timing of sales make it difficult to schedule production and optimize utilization of manufacturing capacity. This uncertainty may require us to increase staffing and incur other expenses in order to meet an unexpected increase in customer demand, potentially placing a significant burden on our resources. An inability to respond to such changes in a timely manner may also cause customer dissatisfaction, which may negatively affect our customer relationships. 

&#160;

Our growth strategies could be ineffective due to the risks of acquisitions and risks relating to integration. 

&#160;

Our growth strategy includes acquiring complementary businesses. In regards to any other future acquisitions, we could fail to identify, finance or complete suitable acquisitions on acceptable terms and prices, particularly with interest rates at comparatively high levels. Acquisitions and the related integration processes could increase a number of risks, including diversion of operations personnel, financial personnel and management&#8217;s attention, difficulties in integrating systems and operations, potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies and exposure to unanticipated liabilities. The price we pay for a business may exceed the value realized and we cannot provide any assurance that we will realize the expected synergies and benefits of any acquisitions. Our discovery of, or failure to discover, material issues during due diligence investigations of acquisition targets, either before closing with regard to potential risks of the acquired operations, or after closing with regard to the timely discovery of breaches of representations, warranties or covenants, could materially harm our business. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating a new business to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition could cause an interruption or loss of momentum in our existing activities and could adversely affect our profitability. Acquisitions also may result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets which are subject to potential impairments in the future that could diminish our reported earnings and operating results.

&#160;

&#160;

We are subject to risks associated with proxy contests and other actions of activist stockholders. 

&#160;

Publicly traded companies have increasingly become subject to campaigns by activist investors advocating corporate actions such as governance changes, financial restructurings, increased borrowings, special dividends, stock repurchases or even sales of assets or entire companies to third parties or the activists themselves. In 2023, WM Argyle Fund, LLC (&#8220;WM Argyle&#8221;) submitted a notice to the Board of Directors (the &#8220;Board&#8221;) purporting to nominate a slate of six candidates for election as directors at our 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. We did not reach an agreement with WM Argyle in connection with its nomination, and there was a contested election at the Company&#8217;s 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, in which none of WM Argyle&#8217;s candidates were elected as directors. The cumulative cost to the Company of responding to the proxy contest was approximately $1.8 million. We value input from all stockholders and remain open to ongoing engagement with our stockholders.

&#160;

A proxy contest or related activities on the part of activist stockholders could adversely affect our business for a number of reasons, including, without limitation, the following:

&#160;

##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; 

Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of our Board, management and our employees;

##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; 

Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, business partners, customers and others important to our success, any of which could negatively affect our business and our results of operations and financial condition;

&#160; &#9679; 

Action by activist stockholders may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel;

##TABLE_END ##TABLE_START &#160; &#9679; 

A successful proxy contest could result in a change in control of our Board, and such an event could subject us to certain contractual obligations under several key agreements, including our existing Amended and Restated 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (as amended, the &#8220;2015 EIP&#8221;), and underlying award agreements and certain employment and lease agreements;

&#160; &#9679; 

If nominees advanced by activist stockholders are elected or appointed to our Board with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plans or to realize long-term value from our assets, and this could in turn have an adverse effect on our business and on our results of operations and financial condition; and

&#160; &#9679; 

Proxy contests may cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility.

##TABLE_END &#160;

&#160;

FINANCIAL RISKS

&#160;

We have generated substantial net losses since our inception. 

&#160;

Historically, we have had several years in which we have experienced operating losses. We have incurred significant costs in connection with the development of our businesses, and because we have operated at low-capacity utilization in certain facilities, there is no assurance that we will generate sufficient revenues to offset anticipated operating costs. Although we anticipate deriving revenues from the sale of our products, no assurance can be given that these products can be sold on a profitable basis. We cannot give any assurance that we will be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. 

&#160;

We may continue to incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown factors.

&#160;

We have significant indebtedness and we may incur additional debt in the future. Servicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash, and the terms of our current indebtedness, and the terms of any future indebtedness, may restrict the activities of the Company. 

&#160;

We have significant indebtedness, including the indebtedness under the 2022 Credit Facility (as defined and further discussed in Note 10 &#8220;Debt and Credit Agreements&#8221; of our consolidated financial statements). Our debt obligations could potentially have important consequences to us and our investors, including: (1) requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to make debt service payments or to refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due, making it more difficult for us to satisfy our other priorities and obligations; (2) resulting in higher interest expenses, (3) increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; (4) reducing the cash flows available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business; (5) limiting our flexibility in pursuing strategic opportunities or planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry; (6) placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that may not be as highly leveraged; and (7) limiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase shares.

&#160;

Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, regulatory factors, and factors beyond our control. Our cash flow from operations in the future may be insufficient to service our indebtedness, including if our actual cash requirements in the future are greater than expected. If we are unable to generate the necessary cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt, incurring new debt or issuing additional equity on terms that may be unfavorable, onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness or incur new debt will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.

&#160;

As described in Note 10 &#8220;Debt and Credit Agreements&#8221; of our consolidated financial statements, the agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants restricting our operations and limiting our financial flexibility. In addition, some of the agreements governing our indebtedness require that we maintain minimum EBITDA requirements, not exceed a maximum fixed charge coverage ratio and contain certain customary events of default. Our ability to comply with such restrictions and covenants may be affected by various factors, some of which factors may be beyond our control. If we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or holders, as applicable, then, subject to the applicable cure periods and conditions, any outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable.

&#160;

Our PPP Loans were forgiven, but we may still be subject to audit and any resulting adverse audit findings of non-compliance could result in the repayment of a portion or all of the PPP Loans and may restrict our flexibility in operating our business or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations. 

&#160;

On April 15, 2020, we received funds under notes and related documents (&#8220;PPP Loans&#8221;) with CIBC Bank, USA under the Paycheck Protection Program (the &#8220;PPP&#8221;), which was established under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (&#8220;CARES Act&#8221;), as amended by the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act of 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and is administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the &#8220;SBA&#8221;). We received total proceeds of $9,530 from the PPP Loans and made repayments of $379 on May 13, 2020. We used at least 60% of our PPP Loan proceeds to pay for payroll costs and the balance on other eligible qualifying expenses that we believe to be consistent with the PPP.

&#160;

&#160;

During the second quarter of 2021, all of our PPP Loans were forgiven by the SBA. However, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has announced that it will conduct audits for PPP Loans that exceed $2,000 for a period of six years after forgiveness. Should we be audited or reviewed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury or the SBA, such audit or review could result in the diversion of management&#8217;s time and attention and cause us to incur significant costs. If we were to be audited and receive an adverse outcome in such an audit, we could be required to return the full amount of the PPP Loans and may potentially be subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties. If it is subsequently determined that the PPP Loans must be repaid, we may be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash and/or cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on the PPP Loans, and any future repayment of such loans, would adversely impact our operations and financial results.

&#160;

&#160;

RISKS RELATED TO OWNING OUR COMMON STOCK

&#160;

There is a limited trading market for our securities and the market price of our securities is subject to volatility. 

&#160;

Our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Historically, we have not had an active trading market for our common stock. The absence of an active trading market increases price volatility and reduces the liquidity of our common stock. The market price and level of trading of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among other things, our limited trading volume, actual or anticipated variations in our operating results and cash flow, the nature and content of our earnings releases, announcements or events that impact our business and the general state of the securities market, as well as general economic, political and market conditions and other factors that may affect our future results. In 2024, the closing price of our common stock varied from a high of $4.42 &#160; per share to a low of $1.55 &#160; per share. Stockholders may have incurred substantial losses with regard to any investment in our common stock adversely affecting stockholder confidence.

&#160;

Limitations on our ability to utilize our NOLs may negatively affect our financial results. 

&#160;

We may not be able to utilize all of our NOLs. For financial statement presentation, all benefits associated with the NOL carryforwards have been reserved; therefore, this potential asset is not reflected on our balance sheet. To the extent available, we will use any NOL carryforwards to reduce the U.S. corporate income tax liability associated with our operations. However, if we do not achieve sufficient profitability prior to their expiration, we will not be able to fully utilize our NOLs to offset income. Section 382 of the IRC (&#8220;Section 382&#8221;) generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of NOL carryforwards that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone certain changes in stock ownership. Our ability to utilize NOL carryforwards and built-in losses may be limited, under Section 382 or otherwise, by our issuance of common stock or by other changes in ownership of our stock. After analyzing Section 382 in 2010, we determined that aggregate changes in our stock ownership had triggered an annual limitation of NOL carryforwards and built-in losses available for utilization to $14,284 per annum. Although this event limited the amount of pre ownership change date NOLs and built- in losses we can utilize annually, it does not preclude us from fully utilizing our current NOL carryforwards prior to their expiration. However, subsequent changes in our stock ownership could further limit our ability to use our NOL carryforwards and our income could be subject to taxation earlier than it would if we were able to use NOL carryforwards and built-in losses without an annual limitation, which could result in lower profits. To address these concerns, in February 2013 we adopted a Section 382 Stockholder Rights Plan, which was subsequently approved by our stockholders and extended in 2016, 2019, and 2022 for additional three-year periods (as amended, the &#8220;Rights Plan&#8221;), designed to preserve our substantial tax assets associated with NOL carryforwards under Section 382. The Rights Plan is intended to deter any person or group from being or becoming the beneficial owner of 4.9% or more of our common stock and thereby triggering a further limitation of our available NOL carryforwards. On February 3, 2025, the Board approved an amendment which included an extension of the Rights Plan for an additional three years. The amendment is subject to approval by our stockholders at our 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. See Note 14, &#8220;Income Taxes&#8221; of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our Rights Plan. There can be no assurance that the Rights Plan will be effective in protecting our NOL carryforwards or that it will be approved by our stockholders at our 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Additionally, because the Rights Plan subjects any person that acquires 4.9% of our common stock without the Board&#8217;s permission to significant dilution, it could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of the Board. In particular, the Rights Plan may deter a third party from completing or even initiating an acquisition of the Company, which may prevent stockholders from realizing a control premium from a potential acquirer, or from otherwise maximizing stockholder value.

&#160;

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS

&#160;

Any failure to protect our customers&#8217; intellectual property that we use in the products we manufacture for them could harm our customer relationships and subject us to liability. 

&#160;

The products we manufacture for our customers often contain our customers&#8217; intellectual property, including copyrights, patents, trade secrets and know-how. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our customers&#8217; intellectual property. The steps we take to protect our customers&#8217; intellectual property may not adequately prevent its disclosure or misappropriation. If we fail to protect our customers&#8217; intellectual property, our customer relationships could be harmed and we may experience difficulty in establishing new customer relationships. Additionally, our customers might pursue legal claims against us for any failure to protect their intellectual property, possibly resulting in harm to our reputation and our business, financial condition and operating results.

&#160;

We may not be able to protect important intellectual property and we could incur substantial costs defending against claims that our products infringe on the proprietary rights of others. 

&#160;

Our ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary system level technologies, systems designs and manufacturing processes. While we have attempted to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights, we do not know whether we have been or will be successful in doing so.

&#160;

Further, our competitors may independently develop or patent technologies or processes that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours. If we are found to be infringing third-party patents, we could be required to pay substantial royalties and/or damages, and we do not know whether we will be able to obtain licenses to use such patents on acceptable terms, if at all. Failure to obtain needed licenses could delay or prevent the development, manufacture or sale of our products, and could necessitate the expenditure of significant resources to develop or acquire non infringing intellectual property.

&#160;

&#160;

We may need to pursue lawsuits or legal action in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation and other proceedings, even if they are successful, are expensive to pursue and time consuming, and we could use a substantial amount of our management and financial resources in either case.

&#160;

Confidentiality agreements to which we are party may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. Our trade secrets may also be known without breach of such agreements or may be independently developed by competitors. Our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology and processes could allow our competitors to limit or eliminate any competitive advantages we may have.

&#160;

LEGAL, TAX, REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE RISKS

&#160;

The U.S. wind energy industry is significantly impacted by tax and other economic incentives. A significant change in these incentives could significantly impact our results of operations and growth. 

&#160;

We sell towers to wind turbine manufacturers who supply wind energy generation facilities. The U.S. wind energy industry is significantly impacted by federal tax incentives and state Renewable Portfolio Standards (&#8220;RPSs&#8221;). Despite recent reductions in the cost of wind energy, due to variability in wind quality and consistency, and other regional differences, wind energy may not be economically viable in certain parts of the country absent such incentives. These programs have provided material incentives to develop wind energy generation facilities and thereby impact the demand for our products. The increased demand for our products that generally results from the credits and incentives could be impacted by the expiration or curtailment of these programs.

&#160;

One such federal government program, the PTC, provides a supplemental payment based on electricity produced from each qualifying wind turbine. Legislative support for the PTC has been intermittent since its introduction in 1992, which has caused volatility in the demand for new wind energy projects. In 2015, the PTC was extended for a five-year period, with a time-based phase-out depending on the year the wind project is commenced. The phase-out schedule legislated in 2015 provided for: 100% extension of the credit for projects commenced before the end of 2016, 80% extension of the credit for projects commenced in 2017, 60% extension of the credit for projects commenced in 2018 and 40% extension of the credit for projects commenced in 2019. As part of a year-end tax extenders bill in 2019, the PTC was extended for an additional year, allowing for a 60% extension of the credit for projects commenced before the end of 2020.

&#160;

On December 27, 2020, COVID IV was signed into law. As part of COVID IV, the PTC was extended for an additional year, allowing for a 60% credit for projects that start construction by the end of 2021. In order to benefit from the PTC, qualifying projects must either be completed within four years from their start of construction, or the developer must demonstrate that its projects are in continuous construction between start of construction and completion. As a result of COVID IV, the PTC will subsidize wind projects commenced as late as 2021 and completed by 2025, or later if continuous construction can be demonstrated. The PTC tax benefits are available for the first ten years of operation of a wind energy facility, and also applies to significant redevelopment of existing wind energy facilities. Included in COVID IV is the addition of a new 30% ITC created for offshore wind projects that start construction by the end of 2025. The provision will be retroactively applied to projects that started production in 2016.

&#160;

On August 16, 2022, the IRA was enacted to reduce inflation and promote clean energy in the United States. The IRA modifies and extends the PTC until the later of 2032 or when greenhouse gas emissions have been reduced by 75% compared to 2022. It provides for tax credits up to a maximum of 30%, adjusted for inflation annually, for electricity generated from qualified renewable energy sources where taxpayers meet prevailing wage standards and employ a sufficient proportion of qualified apprentices from registered apprenticeship programs. It also provides a bonus credit for qualifying clean energy production in energy communities. 

&#160;

The IRA also includes AMP credits for manufacturers of eligible components, including wind and solar components. Manufacturers qualify for the AMP credits based on the electricity output for each component produced and sold in the US starting in 2023 through 2032. The credit amount varies based on the eligible component, which includes solar components, wind energy components, inverters, qualifying battery components, and critical minerals. Tower manufacturers are eligible for credits of $0.03 per watt for applicable components produced. Manufacturers can elect a direct pay option where they can receive a payment equal to the full value of the tax credits from the Internal Revenue Service anytime during the ten-year period. That election lasts for five years, after which the AMP credits can be used against tax obligations or transferred to third parties in exchange for cash. We expect certain financial benefits as a result of tax incentives provided by the IRA. If these expected financial benefits vary significantly from our assumptions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Any modifications to the law or its effects arising, for example, through (i) technical guidance and regulations from the IRS and U.S. Treasury Department, (ii) subsequent amendments to or interpretations of the law, and/or (iii) future laws or regulations rendering certain provisions of the IRA less effective or ineffective, in whole or in part, could result in material adverse changes to the benefits we have recognized and expect to recognize. 

&#160;

Several significant administrative law cases were decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2024, most notably Loper Bright Enterprises V. Raimondo. In Loper Bright, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the U.S. Administrative Procedure Act requires that courts exercise their independent judgment when deciding whether a federal agency has acted within its statutory authority, and not to defer to an agency interpretation solely because a statute is ambiguous. These decisions may result in additional legal challenges to regulations and guidance issued by federal regulatory agencies, including the IRS, which the Company relies on and intends to rely on in the future. Successful challenges of certain regulations, any increased regulatory uncertainty, or delays or other impacts to the federal agency rulemaking process could adversely impact our business and operations.

&#160;

RPSs generally require or encourage state regulated electric utilities to supply a certain proportion of electricity from renewable energy sources or to devote a certain portion of their plant capacity to renewable energy generation. Typically, utilities comply with such standards by qualifying for renewable energy credits evidencing the share of electricity that was produced from renewable sources. Under many state standards, these renewable energy credits can be unbundled from their associated energy and traded in a market system, allowing generators with insufficient credits to meet their applicable state mandate. These standards have spurred significant growth in the wind energy industry and a corresponding increase in the demand for our products. Currently, the majority of states have RPSs in place and certain states have voluntary utility commitments to supply a specific percentage of their electricity from renewable sources. The enactment of RPSs in additional states or any changes to existing RPSs (including changes due to the failure to extend or renew the federal incentives described above), or the enactment of a federal RPS or imposition of other greenhouse gas regulations, may impact the demand for our products. We cannot assure that government support for renewable energy will continue including any assurance regarding the adoption of any of the clean energy provisions of former President Biden&#8217;s Build Back Better agenda. The elimination of, or reduction in, state or federal government policies that support renewable energy could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial performance and future development efforts.

&#160;

&#160;

Changes to trade regulation, quotas, duties or tariffs, and sanctions caused by changing U.S. and geopolitical policies, may impact our competitive position or adversely impact our margins. 

&#160;

Renewed surges of unfairly traded imports continue to threaten our business segments. If existing antidumping and countervailing duty orders were removed or revoked we would expect a renewed surge of unfairly traded imports. While future trade actions on inputs such as steel may affect our pricing, the continued presence of unfairly traded imports in the market may hamper our ability to pass those price increases along. Additionally, the existence of government subsidies available to our competitors in certain countries may affect our ability to compete on a price basis. 

&#160;

Additionally, the war in Ukraine has led to economic sanctions imposed against Russia by the U.S. and certain European nations, including a prohibition on doing business with certain Russian companies which may have led to, or may lead to, certain retaliatory trade restrictions from Russia. Such sanctions may impact companies in many sectors and has lead to volatility of prices in the global energy industry and disruption and volatility in the U.S. and global markets. There is a possibility that such sanctions or trade restrictions may be expanded, or new sanctions or trade restrictions may be imposed by the U.S., Russia, China or other countries, which could further disrupt supply chains and increase volatility of pricing. The extent and duration of the war and extent and strength of the sanctions are still developing, and the corresponding effect on the Company remains uncertain. Certain other geopolitical conflicts, including the war between Israel and Hamas has also lead to material disruptions to certain supply chains and volatility in prices.

&#160;

We could incur substantial costs to comply with environmental, health and safety (&#8220;EHS&#8221;) laws and regulations and to address violations of or liabilities under these requirements. 

&#160;

Our operations are subject to a variety of EHS laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate and sell products governing, among other things, health, safety, pollution and protection of the environment and natural resources, including the use, handling, transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous materials and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges to air, surface water, groundwater and soil, product content, performance and packaging. We cannot guarantee that we have been, or will at all times be in compliance with such laws and regulations. Changes in existing EHS laws and regulations, or their application, could cause us to incur additional or unexpected costs to achieve or maintain compliance. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, obtain the necessary permits to operate our business, or comply with the terms and conditions of such permits may subject us to a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the imposition of civil and criminal sanctions, monetary fines and penalties, remedial obligations, and the issuance of compliance requirements limiting or preventing some or all of our operations. The assertion of claims relating to regulatory compliance, on or off-site contamination, natural resource damage, the discovery of previously unknown environmental liabilities, the imposition of criminal or civil fines or penalties and/or other sanctions, or the obligation to undertake investigation, remediation or monitoring activities could result in potentially significant costs and expenditures to address contamination or resolve claims or liabilities. Such costs and expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Under certain circumstances, violation of such EHS laws and regulations could result in us being disqualified from eligibility to receive federal government contracts or subcontracts under the federal government&#8217;s debarment and suspension system.

&#160;

We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, such liabilities can be imposed for cleanup of currently and formerly owned, leased or operated properties, or properties to which hazardous substances or wastes were sent by current or former operators at our current or former facilities, regardless of whether we directly caused the contamination or violated any law at the time of discharge or disposal. Several of our facilities have a history of industrial operations, and contaminants have been detected at some of our facilities. The presence of contamination from hazardous substances or wastes could interfere with ongoing operations or adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or use our properties as collateral for financing. We also could be held liable under third-party claims for property damage, natural resource damage or personal injury and for penalties and other damages under such environmental laws and regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. During 2024, we did not incur significant remediation costs or penalties related to environmental matters. 

&#160;

&#160;

Our ability to comply with regulatory requirements and potential environmental, social and governance (&#8220;ESG&#8221;) regulations and trends is critical to our future success, and there can be no guarantee that our businesses are in full compliance with all such requirements. 

&#160;

As a manufacturer and distributor of wind and other energy industry products we are subject to the requirements of federal, state, local and foreign regulatory authorities. In addition, we are subject to a number of authorities setting industry standards, such as the American Gear Manufacturers Association and the American Welding Society. Changes in the standards and requirements imposed by such authorities could have a material adverse effect on us. In the event we are unable to meet any such standards when adopted, our businesses could be adversely affected. We may not be able to obtain all regulatory approvals, licenses and permits that may be required in the future, or any necessary modifications to existing regulatory approvals, licenses and permits, or maintain all required regulatory approvals, licenses and permits. There can be no guarantee that our businesses are fully compliant with such standards and requirements.

&#160;

Additionally, other ESG-related laws, regulations, treaties, and similar initiatives and programs are being proposed, adopted and implemented throughout the world. If we were to violate or become liable under environmental or certain ESG-related laws or if our products become non-compliant with such laws or market access requirements, our customers may refuse to purchase our products, and we could incur costs or face other sanctions, such as restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions, fines, and/or civil or criminal sanctions. In addition to potential implementation of ESG laws, investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, other market participants, political figures, stockholders, and customers have focused increasingly on the ESG practices of companies, including those associated with climate change. If our ESG practices do not meet investor or other industry stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our brand, reputation and employee retention may be negatively impacted based on an assessment of our ESG practices.

You should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. If any of the events described in the following risk factors occurs, our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of factors that are described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See &#8220;Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.&#8221; The risks below are not the only risks facing our company. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and/or prospects. Our Risk Factors are not guarantees that no such conditions exist as of the date of this report and should not be interpreted as an affirmative statement that such risks or conditions have not materialized, in whole or in part. 

Summary of Risk Factors 

Below is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in shares of our common stock speculative or risky. This summary does not address all of the risks that we face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks that we face, can be found below under the heading &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and should be carefully considered, together with other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC, before making an investment decision regarding shares of our common stock. 

&#8226; We have a limited number of product candidates, which are still in preclinical or clinical development. If we do not obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially adversely affected. 

&#8226; Clinical trials are expensive, time consuming, difficult to design and implement, and involve uncertain outcomes. Furthermore, the results of previous preclinical studies and clinical trials may not be predictive of future results, and the results of our current and planned clinical trials may not satisfy the requirements of the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities outside the United States. 

&#8226; Our long-term prospects depend in part upon discovering, developing and commercializing additional product candidates, which may fail in development or suffer delays that adversely affect their commercial viability. 

&#8226; Our product candidates may have undesirable side effects that may delay or prevent marketing approval or, if approval is received, require them to be taken off the market, require them to include safety warnings or otherwise limit their sales. 

&#8226; We face significant competition, and if our competitors develop and market products that are more effective, safer and/or less expensive than our product candidates, our commercial opportunities will be negatively impacted. 

&#8226; If zanidatamab or any of our product candidates that receives regulatory approval in the future does not achieve broad market acceptance among physicians, patients, the medical community and third-party payors, revenue generated from royalties or sales would be limited. 

&#8226; We may not be successful in our efforts to use our therapeutic platforms to build a pipeline of product candidates. 

&#8226; If any product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us or any of our strategic partners, we may incur substantial liabilities and commercialization efforts of zanidatamab or our product candidates may need to be limited. 

&#8226; Security breaches and incidents, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business or protected health information or prevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation. 

&#8226; Current and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us or our strategic partners to commercialize any approved products that we or our strategic partners develop and affect the prices that may be obtained. 

&#8226; We have incurred significant losses since inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We have only one product approved for commercial sale, and, as of December 31, 2024, we have not received any revenue or profit from product sales. We may never achieve or sustain profitability. 

&#8226; We will require substantial additional funding, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, and, if not available, may require us to delay, scale back, or cease our product development programs or operations. 

&#8226; Our effective tax rate may change in the future. 

Table of Contents 

&#8226; We depend on our collaborative relationship with Jazz to further develop and commercialize zanidatamab, and if our relationship is not successful or is terminated, we may be delayed in or unable to effectively develop and/or commercialize zanidatamab, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

&#8226; Our existing strategic partnerships are important to our business, and future strategic partnerships will likely also be important to us. If we are unable to maintain our strategic partnerships, or if these strategic partnerships are not successful, our business could be adversely affected. 

&#8226; We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce our product candidates and on other third parties to provide supplies and store, monitor and transport bulk drug substance and drug product. We and our third-party partners may encounter difficulties with respect to these activities that could delay or impair our ability to initiate or complete our clinical trials or commercialize products. 

&#8226; We rely on third parties to monitor, support, conduct and oversee clinical trials of the product candidates that we are developing and, in some cases, to maintain regulatory files for those product candidates. We may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates or commercialize any products that may result from our development efforts if we are not able to maintain or secure agreements with such third parties on acceptable terms, if these third parties do not perform their services as required, or if these third parties fail to timely transfer any regulatory information held by them to us. 

&#8226; If we are unable to obtain, maintain and enforce patent and trade secret protection for our product candidates and related technology, our business could be materially harmed. 

&#8226; If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected. 

&#8226; Our stock price is likely to be volatile and the market price of our common stock may drop below the price paid by stockholders. 

&#8226; Delaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws might delay, discourage or prevent a change in control of Zymeworks or changes in our management, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. 

Risk Factors 

Risks Related to Our Business and the Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates 

We have a limited number of product candidates, which are still in preclinical or clinical development. If we do not obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially adversely affected. 

Our strategic partner Jazz has received accelerated approval from the FDA for Ziihera&#174; (zanidatamab-hrii) for the treatment of adults with previously-treated, unresectable or metastatic HER2+ BTC. Ziihera&#174; is the first product candidate from one of our therapeutic platforms to receive regulatory approval. Our other product candidates are in preclinical or clinical development and we have not submitted an application, or received marketing approval, for any other product candidates, and we may never be able to achieve such regulatory approval. In addition, although Jazz is developing zanidatamab for regulatory approval in additional indications, such regulatory approval may never be achieved. 

Obtaining regulatory approval and commercializing any approved product candidates depends on many factors, including: 

&#8226; successfully completing clinical trials that demonstrate the pre-specified efficacy endpoints and acceptable safety profile of the product candidate in the indication for which approval is sought; 

&#8226; preparation and submission to the appropriate regulatory authorities of an application for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety, purity and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials; 

&#8226; establishing adequate commercial manufacturing arrangements and maintaining a consistent, quality supply of product or establishing our own commercial manufacturing capabilities or reliable arrangements with third-party contract manufacturers; 

&#8226; potential pre-approval audits of nonclinical sites, clinical trial sites, and third-party manufacturing sites that generated the data and product in support of the marketing application; and 

&#8226; launching commercial sales, marketing and distribution operations. 

Table of Contents 

Many of these factors are wholly or partially beyond our control, including clinical advancement, the regulatory submission process and changes in the competitive landscape. If we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner, we could experience significant delays or an inability to develop our product candidates at all. 

Clinical trials are expensive, time consuming, difficult to design and implement, and involve uncertain outcomes. Furthermore, the results of previous preclinical studies and clinical trials may not be predictive of future results, and the results of our current and planned clinical trials may not satisfy the requirements of the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities outside the United States. 

Although our strategic partner Jazz has submitted a BLA with respect to zanidatamab, we have not submitted a BLA to the FDA or similar marketing applications to foreign health authorities with respect to any of our other product candidates. A BLA must include extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to establish the product candidate&#8217;s safety, purity and efficacy for each desired indication. The BLA must also include significant information regarding the manufacturing controls for the product. The novel nature of our product candidates may introduce uncertain, complex, expensive and lengthy challenges that could impact regulatory approval. Even if we eventually complete clinical testing and receive approval of any regulatory filing for our product candidates, the FDA or foreign health authorities may approve our product candidates for a more limited indication or a narrower patient population than we originally requested. 

There is typically an extremely high rate of attrition from the failure of product candidates proceeding through preclinical studies and clinical trials. We will be required to demonstrate with substantial evidence through well-controlled clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in a diverse population before we can seek regulatory approvals for their commercial sale. Our clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we or any of our current and future strategic partners may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical or preclinical testing. In some instances, there can be significant variability in safety or efficacy results between different preclinical studies and clinical trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in clinical trial procedures set forth in protocols, differences in the size and type of the patient populations, changes in and adherence to the clinical trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. Patients treated with our product candidates also may experience side effects or adverse events that are unrelated to our product candidates but may still impact the success of our clinical trials. The inclusion of patients with significant co-morbidities in our clinical trials may result in deaths or other adverse medical events due to an underlying condition or other therapies or medications that such patients may be using. Any of these events could prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval or achieving or maintaining market acceptance and impair our ability to commercialize our product candidates. 

Moreover, success in preclinical studies or early-stage clinical trials does not mean that future clinical trials or registrational clinical trials will be successful because product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities outside the United States, despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. Product candidates that have shown promising results in early clinical trials may suffer significant setbacks in subsequent clinical trials or registrational clinical trials. Similarly, interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are subject to varying interpretations, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. In addition, regulatory delays or rejections may be encountered as a result of many factors, including changes in regulatory policy. 

Applications for our product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including: 

&#8226; the FDA or foreign health authorities may disagree with the design, implementation or data analyses of clinical trials; 

&#8226; the FDA or foreign health authorities may determine that the product candidate(s) do not have adequate risk-benefit ratio or have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that preclude obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use; 

&#8226; the population studied in the clinical program may not be sufficiently broad or representative to assure efficacy and safety in the full population for which approval is sought; 

&#8226; the FDA or foreign regulators may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials; 

&#8226; the data collected from clinical trials of the product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of a BLA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere; 

&#8226; the FDA or foreign health authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes, test procedures and specifications or facilities of third-party manufacturers providing our clinical and commercial supplies; and 

Table of Contents 

&#8226; the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or foreign health authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering clinical data insufficient for approval. 

We have conducted, and may in the future conduct, clinical trials outside the United States. Although the FDA may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States, acceptance of these data is subject to certain conditions imposed by the FDA and its determination that the trials complied with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations. If the FDA does not accept the data from any clinical trials conducted outside the United States, it would likely result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and delay or halt development of any future product candidates. 

Even if regulatory approval is obtained for a particular indication, there is no guarantee that additional indications will be approved, which could materially limit the commercial potential of any approved product. For example, while Jazz intends to seek approval of zanidatamab in additional indications, we cannot be certain that such approvals will be obtained. If additional indications are not approved, our ability to achieve additional milestone payments and royalties on sales of zanidatamab will be materially and negatively impacted. 

If clinical trials for product candidates are prolonged, delayed or stopped, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize product candidates on a timely basis, or at all, which could require us to incur additional costs and delay our receipt of any product revenue. 

We currently have two clinical-stage product candidates, ZW171 and ZW191. We have licensed zanidatamab to our strategic partner Jazz, which has been responsible for completing its clinical development in the United States and other jurisdictions not covered by our license to BeiGene. In November 2024, Jazz announced the FDA granted accelerated approval for Ziihera &#174; for injection for intravenous use for the treatment of adults with previously treated, unresectable or metastatic HER2+ (IHC 3+) BTC. Jazz is conducting the confirmatory trial for Ziihera &#174; related to the accelerated approval. If the confirmatory trial fails to demonstrate a clinical benefit, the FDA may remove Ziihera &#174; from the market, which would negatively impact our ability to earn milestone payments and royalties under our arrangement with Jazz. 

Following the transfer of the zanidatamab development program to Jazz and the discontinuation of our zanidatamab zovodotin clinical development program following a strategic business review, we have been focused on the development of our early-stage product candidates and general discovery efforts. Following the clearance of our IND applications for both ZW171 and ZW191, we are actively progressing with additional submissions in selected non-U.S. countries in relation to our Phase 1 study sites in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. 

The commencement or completion of ongoing or planned clinical trials could be substantially delayed or prevented by many factors, including: 

&#8226; further discussions with the FDA or other regulatory agencies regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials; 

&#8226; the limited number of, and competition for, suitable sites and patients required to conduct our clinical trials, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical trial programs, including some that may be for the same indication as our product candidates; 

&#8226; any delay or failure to obtain approval or agreement to commence a clinical trial in any of the countries where enrollment is planned; 

&#8226; inability to obtain sufficient funds required for a clinical trial; 

&#8226; inability to recruit clinical operations personnel and other personnel with later-stage development experience; 

&#8226; clinical holds on, or other regulatory objections to, a new or ongoing clinical trial; 

&#8226; delay or failure to manufacture sufficient supplies of the product candidate for our clinical trials; 

&#8226; delay or failure to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial agreement terms or clinical trial protocols with prospective sites or CROs, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different sites or CROs; 

&#8226; delay or failure to obtain institutional review board (&#8220;IRB&#8221;) approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site; 

&#8226; slower than expected rates of patient recruitment and enrollment; 

&#8226; failure of patients to complete the clinical trial or to be lost to follow up; 

Table of Contents 

&#8226; the inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients in studies to ensure adequate statistical power to detect statistically significant treatment effects; 

&#8226; unforeseen safety issues, including severe or unexpected drug-related adverse effects experienced by patients, including possible deaths; 

&#8226; lack of efficacy during clinical trials; 

&#8226; termination of our clinical trials by one or more clinical trial sites; 

&#8226; inability or unwillingness of patients or clinical investigators to follow our clinical trial protocols; 

&#8226; inability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment by us or our CROs; 

&#8226; our CROs or clinical study sites failing to comply with the trial protocol or regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all, deviating from the protocol or dropping out of a study; 

&#8226; the inability to address any noncompliance with regulatory requirements or safety concerns that arise during the course of a clinical trial; 

&#8226; third-party contractors becoming debarred or suspended or otherwise penalized by the FDA or foreign health authorities for violations of applicable regulatory requirements; 

&#8226; delays in the testing, validation, manufacturing and delivery of our product candidates to the clinical trial sites, including due to a facility manufacturing any of our product candidates or any of their components being ordered by the FDA or foreign health authorities to temporarily or permanently shut down due to violations of cGMP regulations or other applicable requirements, or cross-contaminations of product candidates in the manufacturing process; 

&#8226; the need to repeat or terminate clinical trials as a result of inconclusive or negative results or unforeseen complications in testing; 

&#8226; our clinical trials may be suspended or terminated upon a breach or pursuant to the terms of any agreement with, or for any other reason by, current or future strategic partners that have responsibility for the clinical development of any of our product candidates; and 

&#8226; receiving untimely or unfavorable feedback from applicable regulatory authorities regarding the trial or requests from regulatory authorities to modify the design of a trial. 

Furthermore, a clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, the IRBs for the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, the Data Monitoring Committee for such trial, or by the FDA or foreign health authorities due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or foreign health authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a product candidate, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. If we experience termination of, or delays in the completion of, any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenue will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue. 

Changes in regulatory requirements, policies and guidelines may also occur and we may need to significantly amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes with appropriate regulatory authorities. These changes may require us to renegotiate terms with CROs or resubmit clinical trial protocols to IRBs for re-examination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial. Our clinical trials may be suspended or terminated at any time by the FDA, other regulatory authorities, the IRB overseeing the clinical trial at issue, any of our clinical trial sites with respect to that site, or us. 

Any failure or significant delay in commencing or completing clinical trials would adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval, and our commercial prospects and ability to generate product revenue will be diminished. In addition, even if trials are successfully completed, clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and we cannot guarantee that the FDA or foreign health authorities will interpret the results as we do, and more trials could be required before we submit our product candidates for approval. We cannot guarantee that the FDA or foreign health authorities will view any of our product candidates as having adequate safety and efficacy profiles even if favorable results are observed in these clinical trials, and we may receive unexpected or unfavorable feedback from the FDA or foreign health authorities regarding satisfaction of safety, purity and potency (including clinical efficacy), amongst other factors. To the extent the results of the trials are not satisfactory to the FDA or foreign health authorities for support of a marketing application, approval of our 

Table of Contents 

product candidates may be significantly delayed, or we may be required to expend significant additional resources, which may not be available to us, to conduct additional trials in support of potential approval of our product candidates. 

Our long-term prospects depend in part upon discovering, developing and commercializing additional product candidates, which may fail in development or suffer delays that adversely affect their commercial viability. 

Our future operating results are dependent in part on our ability to successfully discover, develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize product candidates beyond zanidatamab and the product candidates we currently have in clinical and preclinical development. A product candidate can unexpectedly fail at any stage of preclinical and clinical development. Our investments in our early-stage research and development efforts may not yield any promising product candidates. Even if our research and development efforts yield product candidates that advance into clinical studies, the historical failure rate for product candidates is high due to risks relating to safety, efficacy, clinical execution, changing standards of medical care and other unpredictable variables. The results from preclinical testing or early clinical trials of a product candidate may not be predictive of the results that will be obtained in later stage clinical trials of the product candidate. 

The success of other product candidates we may develop will depend on many factors, including generating sufficient data to support the initiation or continuation of clinical trials and obtaining regulatory permission to initiate clinical trials. Even if we successfully advance any other product candidates into clinical development, their success will be subject to all of the clinical, regulatory and commercial risks described elsewhere in this &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section. We cannot assure you that we will ever be able to discover, develop, obtain regulatory approval of, commercialize or generate significant revenue from our other product candidates. 

If we, or any of our strategic partners, are unable to enroll patients in clinical trials, we will be unable to complete these trials on a timely basis or at all. 

Patient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of subjects to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, ability to obtain and maintain patient consents, risk that enrolled subjects will drop out before completion, competing clinical trials and clinicians&#8217; and patients&#8217; perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. In particular, we are developing certain of our product candidates for the treatment of rare diseases, which have limited pools of patients from which to draw for clinical testing. If we, or any of our strategic partners that perform clinical tests for our product candidates, are unable to enroll a sufficient number of patients to complete clinical testing, we will be unable to gain marketing approval for such product candidates and our business will be harmed. Additionally, projections of addressable patient populations that have the potential to benefit from treatment with our or our strategic partners&#8217; product candidates are based on estimates, and, if such estimates are inaccurate, could have an adverse material impact on our business. 

In addition, the U.S. federal Right to Try Act, among other things, provides a framework for patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA approval under the FDA expanded access program. While there is no obligation to make product candidates available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act, new and emerging legislation regarding expanded access to unapproved drugs could negatively impact enrollment in our clinical trials and our business in the future. 

The design or our execution of clinical trials may not support regulatory approval. 

The design or execution of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support regulatory approval, and flaws in the design or execution of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. In some instances, there can be significant variability in safety or efficacy results between different trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in trial protocols, differences in size and type of the patient populations, adherence to the dosing regimen and other trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. We do not know whether any Phase 2, Phase 3 or other clinical trials we or any of our strategic partners may conduct will demonstrate consistent or adequate efficacy and safety to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates. 

Further, the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and in determining when or whether regulatory approval will be obtained for any of our product candidates. Our product candidates may not be approved even if they achieve their primary endpoints in any Phase 3 clinical trials or registration trials. The FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities may disagree with our trial design and our interpretation of data from preclinical studies 

Table of Contents 

and clinical trials. In addition, any of these regulatory authorities may change requirements for the approval of a product candidate even after reviewing and providing comments or advice on a protocol for a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that has the potential to result in FDA or other agencies&#8217; approval. In addition, any of these regulatory authorities may approve a product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than we request or may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials. The FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities may not approve the labeling claims that we believe would be necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates. 

Interim, preliminary or top-line data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data. 

From time to time, we may publish interim, preliminary or top-line data from clinical trials. Interim data from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data becomes available. Preliminary or top-line data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary or top-line data previously published. As a result, interim, preliminary and top-line data should be viewed with caution until the final data is available. Adverse differences between interim, preliminary or top-line data and final data could significantly harm our reputation and business prospects. Moreover, preliminary, interim and top-line data are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as more patient data become available when patients mature on study, patient enrollment continues or as other ongoing or future clinical trials with a product candidate further develop. Past results of clinical trials may not be predictive of future results. 

The information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically more extensive information, and you or others may not agree with what we determine is the material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure. Any information we determine not to disclose may ultimately be deemed significant with respect to future decisions, conclusions, views, activities or otherwise regarding a particular product candidate or our business. Similarly, even if we are able to complete our planned and ongoing preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates according to our current development timeline, the positive results from such preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates may not be replicated in subsequent preclinical studies or clinical trial results. 

Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials after achieving positive results in early-stage development and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. These setbacks have been caused by, among other things, preclinical and other nonclinical findings made while clinical trials were underway or safety or efficacy observations made in preclinical studies and clinical trials, including previously unreported adverse events. Moreover, preclinical, nonclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses and many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials nonetheless failed to obtain FDA or other regulatory approval. 

The Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations received for zanidatamab may not result in faster development, regulatory review or approval process. 

The FDA has granted Fast Track designations to zanidatamab for the first-line treatment of patients with HER2-overexpressing GEA in combination with standard of care chemotherapy and for previously treated or recurrent gene-amplified BTC. While the FDA granted accelerated approval in November 2024 for Ziihera &#174; for injection for intravenous use for the treatment of adults with previously treated, unresectable or metastatic HER2+ BTC (IHC 3+), these Fast Track designations do not ensure that zanidatamab will experience a faster development, regulatory review or approval process compared to conventional FDA procedures or that zanidatamab will ultimately obtain regulatory approval for additional indications. The FDA may withdraw Fast Track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from the zanidatamab clinical development program. The FDA also granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for zanidatamab for treatment of patients with previously treated HER2 gene-amplified locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic BTC. Designation as a Breakthrough Therapy is within the discretion of the FDA and the FDA may decide to rescind a Breakthrough Therapy designation if it believes that a designated product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification of this program. If a clinical development program is suspended, terminated, or put on clinical hold due to unexpected adverse events or other issues, including clinical supply issues, the benefits associated with the Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designations may not be realized by us or our strategic partners. Furthermore, Fast Track designation does not change the standards for approval, and the designation alone does not guarantee qualification for the FDA&#8217;s priority review procedures. Zanidatamab has also been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation from the CDE in China for treating patients with BTC who have failed prior systemic therapies. This designation alone does not guarantee faster approval of zanidatamab in China.

Development of product candidates in combination with other therapies could expose us to additional risks. 

We are subject to risks that the FDA, the EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities could revoke approval of any therapies used in combination with zanidatamab or any other product candidate that receives marketing approval. We are also subject to the risk that safety, efficacy, manufacturing or supply issues could arise with such therapies. In addition, it is possible that existing therapies with which zanidatamab or our product candidates are approved for use could themselves fall out of favor or be relegated to later lines of treatment, which could result in such products being removed from the market or being less successful commercially. We may also evaluate our product candidates in combination with one or more other therapies that have not yet been approved for marketing by the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. We will not be able to market and sell any product candidate in combination with any such unapproved therapies that do not ultimately obtain marketing approval. If the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities do not approve or revoke their approval of these other therapies, or if safety, efficacy, commercial adoption, manufacturing or supply issues arise with the therapies we choose to evaluate in combination with any other product candidate, we may be unable to obtain approval of or successfully market any one or all of the product candidates we develop. 

Additionally, if the third-party providers of therapies or therapies in development used in combination with zanidatamab or our product candidates are unable to produce sufficient quantities for clinical trials or for commercialization of our product candidates, or if the cost of combination therapies is prohibitive, our development and commercialization efforts would be impaired, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. 

If we are unable to successfully develop any required companion diagnostic tests for our product candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, or rely on third parties in the development of such companion diagnostic tests, we may not realize the full commercial potential of our product candidates. 

If we develop a product candidate for which there are no commercially available diagnostic tests for identifying the appropriate patient population to ensure safe and effective use of such candidate, the FDA may require us to develop a companion diagnostic plan in conjunction with clinical development and regulatory approval for our product candidate. Lack of a reliable commercially available companion diagnostic can introduce uncertainties in the regulatory process for our product candidate. Developing a companion diagnostic or working with a third party to develop such companion diagnostic for our product candidate will require more resources and could expose us to additional liabilities related to government regulation of companion diagnostics. If the FDA expects to review and approve simultaneously marketing submissions for a therapeutic candidate and its companion diagnostic, any delay in diagnostic marketing clearance or approval could delay the drug approval. 

In particular, in April 2020, the FDA issued guidance on developing and labeling companion diagnostics for a specific group of oncology therapeutic products, including recommendations to support a broader labeling claim rather than individual therapeutic products. In June 2023, the FDA announced a voluntary pilot program through which drug manufacturers can provide to the FDA the diagnostic test performance information used to enroll patients into clinical trials for drug approval. Based on assessment of the performance information, the FDA will publish the minimum performance characteristics recommended for similar tests that may be used to select patients for treatment with the approved drug to help laboratories identify specific biomarkers for their development of laboratory-developed tests (&#8220;LDTs&#8221;), and to ensure more consistent performance of these tests for drug selection and improved cancer patient care. In May 2024, the FDA issued a final rule that phases out its enforcement discretion for most LDTs and amends the FDA&#8217;s regulations to make explicit that in vitro diagnostics are medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, including when the manufacturer of the diagnostic product is a laboratory. This final rule is subject to ongoing judicial challenges. Changes in the leadership of the FDA and other federal agencies under the new Trump administration can result in changes in policies and new regulations that impact the regulation of LDTs and our companion diagnostic development plans. We will continue to evaluate the impact of this rule on our companion diagnostic development and strategy. Any future issuances from the FDA and other regulatory authorities, including changes in the FDA&#8217;s regulation of diagnostic tests and LDTs, may impact our development of a companion diagnostic for our product candidates and result in delays in regulatory approval. We may be required to conduct additional studies to support a broader claim. Also, to the extent other approved diagnostics are able to broaden their labeling claims to include our approved drug products, we may be forced to abandon any of our companion diagnostic development plans, or we may not be able to compete effectively upon approval, which could adversely impact our ability to generate revenue from the sale of approved products and our business operations. 

We may rely on third parties for the design, development and manufacture of companion diagnostic tests for our product candidates that require such tests. To be successful, we or our collaborators will need to address a number of scientific, technical, regulatory and logistical challenges. If we or such third parties are unable to successfully develop companion diagnostics, or experience delays in doing so, we may be unable to enroll enough patients for our current and planned clinical 

Table of Contents 

trials, the development of our product candidates may be adversely affected or we may not obtain marketing approval, and we may not realize the full commercial potential of our product candidates. 

Disruptions at the FDA and other government agencies caused by funding shortages, reductions in staff or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire, retain or deploy key leadership and other personnel, or otherwise prevent new or modified product candidates from being developed, or approved or commercialized in a timely manner or at all, which could negatively impact our business. 

The ability of the FDA to review and clear or approve new product candidates can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, statutory, regulatory, and policy changes, the FDA&#8217;s ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and other events that may otherwise affect the FDA&#8217;s ability to perform routine functions. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies, including delays or disruptions due to pandemics or other health crises, travel restrictions, staffing shortages, government shutdowns and furloughs, may also slow the time necessary for new product candidates to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. Additionally, the current Presidential administration is pursuing significant reductions in the number of federal employees across numerous agencies. A significant reduction in the number of FDA personnel as a result of this initiative could materially impact review timelines and negatively and adversely impact our business. 

Successful development of our current and future product candidates is uncertain and we may discontinue or reprioritize the development of any of our product candidates at any time, at our discretion. 

Before obtaining regulatory approval for the commercial distribution of our product candidates, we must conduct, at our own expense, extensive preclinical tests and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Preclinical and clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. Additionally, the results from nonclinical testing or early clinical trials of a product candidate may not predict the results that will be obtained in subsequent human clinical trials of that product candidate. There is a high failure rate for drugs proceeding through clinical studies. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in clinical development even after achieving promising results in earlier studies, and any such setbacks in any future clinical development could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Alternatively, management may elect to discontinue development of certain product candidates to accommodate a shift in corporate strategy, despite positive clinical results. Based on our operating results and business strategy, among other factors, we may discontinue the development of any of our other product candidates under development or reprioritize our focus on other product candidates at any time and at our discretion. 

Because we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on research programs, therapeutic platforms and product candidates that we identify for specific indications. As a result, we may forgo or delay pursuit of opportunities with other therapeutic platforms or product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights. 

Our product candidates may have undesirable side effects that may delay or prevent marketing approval or, if approval is received, require them to be taken off the market, require them to include safety warnings or otherwise limit their sales. 

Unforeseen side effects from any of our product candidates could arise either during clinical development or, if approved by regulatory authorities, after the approved product has been marketed. As our product candidates are evaluated in clinical trials, the results of such clinical trials may show that our product candidates cause undesirable or unacceptable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials, and result in delay of, or failure to obtain, marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities, or result in marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities with restrictive label warnings, limited patient populations or potential product liability claims. Even if we believe that our clinical trials and preclinical studies demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, only the FDA and other comparable regulatory agencies may ultimately make such determination. 

If we or others later identify undesirable or unacceptable side effects caused by zanidatamab or other product candidates that receive marketing approval: 

&#8226; regulatory authorities may require the approved product to be taken off the market; 

Table of Contents 

&#8226; regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, specific warnings, a contraindication or field alerts to physicians and pharmacies, or impose a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy that includes restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing and/or dispensing; 

&#8226; we or our partners may be required to change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the product; 

&#8226; we or our partners may be subject to limitations on how we may promote the product; 

&#8226; sales of the product may decrease significantly; 

&#8226; we may be subject to litigation or product liability claims; and 

&#8226; our reputation may suffer. 

Any of these events could prevent us or our current or future strategic partners from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating revenue from the sale of any future products. 

We face significant competition, and if our competitors develop and market products that are more effective, safer and/or less expensive than our product candidates, our commercial opportunities will be negatively impacted. 

The life sciences industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We are developing biotherapeutics that will compete with other drugs and therapies that currently exist or are being developed. Products we may develop in the future are also likely to face competition from other drugs and therapies, some of which we may not currently be aware. We have competitors in the United States and internationally, including major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, universities and other research institutions. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, drug development, technical and human resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical companies, in particular, have extensive experience in clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals, recruiting patients and in manufacturing pharmaceutical products. These companies also have significantly greater research and marketing capabilities than we do and may also have products that have been approved or are in late stages of development and collaborative arrangements in our target markets with leading companies and research institutions. Established pharmaceutical companies may also invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in-license novel compounds that could make the product candidates that we develop obsolete. As a result of all of these factors, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection or FDA approval or discovering, developing and commercializing products in our field before we do. Specifically, there are a large number of companies developing or marketing treatments for cancer and AIID, including many major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. These treatments consist both of small-molecule drug products, as well as biologics that work by using various antibody therapeutic platforms to address specific targets. 

Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, more convenient or less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our product candidates, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. 

Smaller and other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. In addition, the biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid technological change. If we fail to stay at the forefront of technological change, we may be unable to compete effectively. Technological advances or products developed by our competitors may render our technologies or product candidates obsolete, less competitive or not economical. 

We expect to compete with biosimilar versions of already approved products, and even if additional product candidates achieve marketing approval, they may be challenged to achieve a price premium over competitive biosimilar products and will compete for market share with them. 

The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, which is included in the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (&#8220; PPACA &#8221;) , authorized the FDA to approve similar versions of innovative biologics, commonly known as biosimilars. Under the PPACA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is &#8220;biosimilar to&#8221; or &#8220;interchangeable with&#8221; a previously approved biologic product or &#8220;reference product.&#8221; Manufacturers may not submit an

application for a biosimilar to the FDA until four years following approval of the reference product, and the FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was approved. Even if our product candidates, if approved, are deemed to be reference products eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor&#8217;s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. Additionally, from time to time, there are proposals to repeal or modify the PPACA, including proposals that could significantly shorten the exclusivity period for biologics. 

If zanidatamab or any of our product candidates that receives regulatory approval in the future does not achieve broad market acceptance among physicians, patients, the medical community and third-party payors, revenue generated from royalties or sales would be limited. 

The commercial success of zanidatamab or our product candidates will depend upon their acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical community. The degree of market acceptance of zanidatamab or our product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including: 

&#8226; limitations or warnings contained in the approved labeling; 

&#8226; changes in the standard of care for the targeted indications; 

&#8226; limitations in the approved clinical indications; 

&#8226; demonstrated clinical safety and efficacy compared to other products; 

&#8226; sales, marketing and distribution support; 

&#8226; availability of coverage and the extent of access and reimbursement from managed care plans and other third-party payors; 

&#8226; timing of market introduction and perceived effectiveness of competitive products; 

&#8226; availability of alternative therapies at similar or lower cost; 

&#8226; the extent to which the product is approved for inclusion on formularies of hospitals and managed care organizations; 

&#8226; whether the product is designated under physician treatment guidelines as a first-line therapy or as a second- or third-line therapy for particular diseases; 

&#8226; whether the product can be used effectively with other therapies to achieve higher response rates; 

&#8226; adverse publicity about the product or favorable publicity about competitive products; 

&#8226; convenience and ease of administration of the product; and 

&#8226; potential product liability claims. 

If zanidatamab or any of our product candidates that are approved in the future do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, patients and the medical community, we may not generate sufficient revenue from these products, and we may not become or remain profitable. In addition, efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of zanidatamab or our product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful. 

We or our strategic partners may be unable to obtain orphan drug exclusivity in specific indications for zanidatamab or in future product candidates that we may develop. If our competitors are able to obtain orphan product exclusivity for their products in specific indications, we may not be able to have competing products approved in those indications by the applicable regulatory authority for a significant period of time. 

The FDA has granted Orphan Drug Designation to zanidatamab for the treatment of BTC and gastric cancer, including cancer of the gastroesophageal junction, the EMA has granted Orphan Drug Designation to zanidatamab for the treatment of gastric cancer and BTC, and we or our strategic partners may seek Orphan Drug Designation for zanidatamab or other product candidates for additional indications in the future. Orphan Drug Designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process. 

Generally, if a product candidate with an Orphan Drug Designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the EMA or the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for that time period. 

Table of Contents 

The applicable period is seven years in the United States and ten years in Europe. The European exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a product no longer meets the criteria for Orphan Drug Designation or if the product is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified. Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or EMA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. The loss of Orphan Drug Designation could have a negative effect on our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, earn revenues and achieve profitability. 

Even if orphan drug exclusivity for zanidatamab is obtained, or is obtained for any other product candidates that receive an Orphan Drug Designation in the future, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs with different active moieties can be approved for the same condition. Further, in the United States, even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug for the same condition submitted by a competitor if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. If we or our strategic partners are unable to manufacture sufficient supply of a product to meet the needs of patients, the FDA can withdraw orphan exclusive marketing rights or approve another marketing application for the same drug product before the expiration of the exclusivity period. 

Further, in Catalyst Pharms., Inc. v. Becerra, 14 F.4th 1299 (11th Cir. 2021), the court disagreed with the FDA&#8217;s longstanding position that the orphan drug exclusivity only applies to the approved use or indication within an eligible disease, and not to all uses or indications within the entire disease or condition. In January 2023, the FDA published a notice in the Federal Register to clarify that while the agency complies with the court&#8217;s order in Catalyst, the FDA intends to continue to apply its longstanding interpretation of the regulations to matters outside of the scope of the Catalyst order &#8211; that is, the agency will continue tying the scope of orphan drug exclusivity to the uses or indications for which a drug is approved, which permits other sponsors to obtain approval of a drug for new uses or indications within the same orphan designated disease or condition that have not yet been approved. The U.S Supreme Court&#8217;s recent Chevron decision may invite lawsuits against the FDA to challenge longstanding decisions and policies of the FDA, including the FDA&#8217;s statutory interpretations of market exclusivities, which could undermine the FDA&#8217;s authority, lead to uncertainty in the industry, and disrupt the FDA&#8217;s normal operations. Further, the Trump administration, along with new leadership at the FDA, may issue new policies and regulations. Executive actions under the Trump administration, such as layoffs, a hiring freeze and budget cuts, may also disrupt the normal operations of federal agencies. It is unclear how future litigation, legislation, agency decisions, and administrative actions will impact the scope of the orphan drug exclusivity. 

Even if we obtain FDA approval of any of our product candidates, we may never obtain approval or commercialize such product candidates outside of the United States, which would limit our ability to realize their full market potential. 

In order to market any products outside of the United States, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approvals could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs and may require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, which would be costly and time consuming. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and region to region and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in those countries. Satisfying these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays. Our failure to obtain regulatory approval in any country may delay or have negative effects on the process for regulatory approval in other countries. Zanidatamab is the only product developed using our therapeutic platforms to have received FDA approval, and as of the date of this report, no approvals in international markets have been obtained. Such approval was received by our strategic partner Jazz, and we do not have experience in obtaining regulatory approval in the United States or international markets. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our products will be harmed. 

Our ability to eventually generate significant revenues from product sales will depend on a number of factors, including: 

&#8226; successful completion of preclinical studies; 

&#8226; submission of IND and non-U.S. applications, or other regulatory applications, for our planned clinical trials or future clinical trials and authorizations from regulators to initiate clinical studies; 

&#8226; successful enrollment in, and completion of, clinical trials; 

&#8226; achieving favorable results from clinical trials; 

Table of Contents 

&#8226; receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; 

&#8226; establishing and maintaining sufficient manufacturing capabilities, for clinical and commercial supply; 

&#8226; obtaining pricing, reimbursement, and hospital formulary access; 

&#8226; establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and launching commercial sales of our products, if and when approved, whether alone or in combination with other products; 

&#8226; sufficiency of our financial and other resources to complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials and commercialization activities; 

&#8226; effectively competing with other therapies; 

&#8226; developing and implementing successful marketing and reimbursement strategies; 

&#8226; obtaining and maintaining patent, trade secret and other intellectual property protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; and 

&#8226; maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of any product following approval, if any. 

If we do not achieve one or more of these requirements in a timely manner, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, which would materially harm our business. To become and remain profitable, we must develop, obtain approval for and eventually commercialize products, if approved, that generate significant revenue. Even if we obtain approval and begin commercializing one or more of our product candidates, we may never generate revenue that is significant or large enough to achieve profitability. 

Even if we succeed in commercializing one or more of our product candidates, we will continue to incur substantial research and development, manufacturing and other expenditures to develop and market additional product candidates. Our failure to become or remain profitable would decrease the value of the Company and could impair our ability to raise capital, maintain our research and development efforts, expand our business or continue our operations. 

Reimbursement decisions by third-party payors may have an adverse effect on pricing and market acceptance. If there is not sufficient reimbursement for our products, it is less likely that our products will be widely used. 

The regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing, coverage and reimbursement for new drugs vary widely from country to country. Many countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. The pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted in most cases. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain regulatory approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. In many countries, particularly those in the EU, prescription drug pricing and reimbursement is subject to governmental control. In those countries that impose price controls, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we or our strategic partners may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other available therapies. 

Our ability to commercialize any products successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to the payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products. If we are not currently capturing the scientific and clinical data that will be required for reimbursement approval, we may be required to conduct additional trials, which may delay or suspend reimbursement approval. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of a product candidate that receives regulatory approval to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. 

Even if our product candidates are approved for sale by the appropriate regulatory authorities, market acceptance and sales of these products will depend on reimbursement policies and may be affected by future healthcare reform measures. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs 

Table of Contents 

they will reimburse and establish payment levels. We cannot be certain that reimbursement will be available for any products that we develop. If reimbursement is not available or is available on a limited basis, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any approved products. 

We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any products that we develop, due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative proposals. In August 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes prescription drug provisions that have significant implications for the pharmaceutical industry and Medicare beneficiaries, including allowing the federal government to negotiate a maximum fair price for certain high-priced single-source Medicare drugs, imposing penalties and excise tax for manufacturers that fail to comply with the drug price negotiation requirements, requiring inflation rebates for all Medicare Part B and Part D drugs, with limited exceptions, if their drug prices increase faster than inflation, and redesigning Medicare Part D to reduce out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for beneficiaries, among other changes. Only high-expenditure single-source drugs that have been approved for at least seven years (11 years for single-source biologics) can qualify for negotiation, with the negotiated price taking effect two years after the selection year. Various industry stakeholders have initiated lawsuits against the federal government asserting that the price negotiation provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act are unconstitutional. The impact of these judicial challenges, future challenges in view of the U.S. Supreme Court&#8217;s overruling of the Chevron doctrine, changes in the leadership of the federal agencies, legislative, executive, and administrative actions and any future healthcare measures and agency rules implemented by the government on us and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole is unclear. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our product candidates if approved. 

There may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA, EMA or other regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution expenses. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also be insufficient to cover our and any collaborator&#8217;s costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that currently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Our or any collaborator&#8217;s inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable payment rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we or our strategic partners develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize product candidates and our overall financial condition. 

We may not be successful in our efforts to use our therapeutic platforms to build a pipeline of product candidates. 

We intend to use our therapeutic platforms to build a pipeline of product candidates and progress these product candidates through clinical development for the treatment of a variety of diseases. Although our research and development efforts as of the date of this report have resulted in a pipeline of product candidates directed at various cancers and AIID, we may not be able to develop product candidates that are safe and effective. Although we expect that our therapeutic platforms will allow us to develop further product candidates, they may not prove to be successful at doing so. Even if we are successful in continuing to build our pipeline, the potential product candidates that we identify may not be suitable for clinical development, including as a result of being shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to be products that will receive marketing approval and achieve market acceptance. If we do not continue to successfully develop and begin to commercialize product candidates, we will face difficulty in obtaining product revenue in future periods, which could result in significant harm to our financial position and adversely affect our stock price. 

Even if we receive regulatory approval to commercialize any of the product candidates that we develop, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. 

Any regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates may be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or subject to certain conditions of approval, and may contain requirements for potentially costly post-approval trials, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the marketed product. For example, in November 2024 the FDA granted accelerated approval for Ziihera&#174; for the treatment of adults with previously treated, unresectable or metastatic HER2+ (IHC 3+) BTC. However, continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. 

Table of Contents 

For any approved product, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and extensive oversight by regulatory authorities, including with respect to manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-approval information and reports, as well as continued compliance with cGMP and good clinical practice (&#8220;GCP&#8221;), for any clinical trials that we or our strategic partners conduct after approval. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things: 

&#8226; restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product; 

&#8226; withdrawal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory product recalls; 

&#8226; fines, warning letters or holds on clinical trials; 

&#8226; refusal by the FDA, EMA or another applicable regulatory authority to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or our strategic partners, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 

&#8226; product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and 

&#8226; injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

Occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our business also may be impacted by new policies and leadership at the FDA and other federal agencies under the new Presidential administration. Such changes and transition to the Trump administration may delay our interactions and submissions with the FDA, our clinical development timeline, or result in increased compliance costs. Further, the FDA&#8217;s or other ex-U.S. regulators&#8217; policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We also cannot predict the full impact of the U.S. Supreme Court's recent decision overruling the Chevron doctrine, future judicial challenges brought against the FDA, or the nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained, which would adversely affect our business, prospects and ability to achieve or sustain profitability. 

The FDA strictly regulates manufacturers&#8217; promotional claims of drug products. In particular, a drug product may not be promoted by manufacturers for uses that are not approved by the FDA, as reflected in the FDA-approved labeling, although healthcare professionals are permitted to use drug products for off-label uses. The FDA, among other government agencies, actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting manufacturers&#8217; promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including large civil and criminal fines, penalties, and enforcement actions. The FDA has also imposed consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed for companies that engaged in such prohibited activities. If we cannot successfully manage the promotion of any approved product candidates, we could become subject to significant liability, which would materially adversely affect our business and financial condition. 

If any product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us or any of our strategic partners, we may incur substantial liabilities and commercialization efforts of zanidatamab or our product candidates may need to be limited. 

We face an inherent risk of product liability lawsuits related to the testing of our product candidates in seriously ill patients, and face an even greater risk as a result of commercialization of any approved product candidates. Product liability claims may be brought against us or our strategic partners by participants enrolled in our clinical trials, patients, health care providers or others using, administering or selling any of our current or future approved products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against any such claims, we may incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in: 

&#8226; decreased demand for any current or future approved products; 

&#8226; injury to our reputation; 

&#8226; limitations placed on our promotional activities; 

&#8226; withdrawal of clinical trial participants; 

&#8226; termination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs; 

&#8226; increased regulatory scrutiny; 

Table of Contents 

&#8226; significant litigation costs; 

&#8226; substantial monetary awards to, or costly settlement with, patients or other claimants; 

&#8226; product recalls or a change in the indications for which they may be used; 

&#8226; loss of revenue; 

&#8226; diversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations; and 

&#8226; the inability to commercialize approved products. 

We may need to have in place increased product liability coverage when we begin the commercialization of any product candidates. Insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and we may be unable to maintain or obtain sufficient insurance at a reasonable cost to protect us against losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us, particularly if judgments exceed any insurance coverage we may have, could decrease our cash resources and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation. 

Patients with cancer and other diseases targeted by zanidatamab and our product candidates are often already in severe and advanced stages of disease and have both known and unknown significant pre-existing and potentially life-threatening health risks. During the course of treatment, patients may suffer adverse events, including death, for reasons that may be related to zanidatamab or our product candidates. Such events could subject us to costly litigation, require us to pay substantial amounts of money to injured patients, delay, negatively impact or end the opportunity to receive or maintain regulatory approval to market zanidatamab or our product candidates, or require us or our strategic partners to suspend or abandon commercialization efforts. Even in circumstances in which we do not believe that an adverse event is related to zanidatamab or our product candidates, the investigation into the circumstance may be time-consuming or inconclusive. These investigations may interrupt our sales efforts, delay our regulatory approval process in other countries, or impact and limit the type of regulatory approvals zanidatamab or our product candidates receive or maintain. As a result of these factors, a product liability claim, even if successfully defended, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

If we, our strategic partners or any of our third-party manufacturers encounter manufacturing difficulties, our ability to provide supply of our product candidates for clinical trials or any approved products for patients could be delayed or prevented. 

The manufacture of biological drug products is complex and requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques, process and quality controls. Manufacturers of biologic products often encounter difficulties in production and sourcing, particularly in scaling up or out, validating the production process and assuring high reliability of the manufacturing processes (including the absence of contamination), in light of variations and supply constraints of key components. These problems include logistics and shipping, difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including consistency, stability, purity and efficacy of the product, product testing, operator error and availability of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with applicable federal, state and foreign regulations. If contaminants are discovered in the supply of our products or product candidates or in the manufacturing facilities, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination. We cannot assure you that any stability, purity, and efficacy failures, deficiencies, or other issues relating to the manufacture of our products or product candidates will not occur in the future. Even if any of our product candidates is approved, these manufacturing difficulties and supply chain risks will persist and an inability to source sufficient commercial supply would materially and negatively impact our commercialization efforts and financial results. Our research and development activities also involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including chemical and biological materials, by our third-party manufacturers. While we currently outsource all manufacturing to third parties, we and our manufacturers are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of medical and hazardous materials. Although we believe that our manufacturers&#8217; procedures relating to these laws comply with legally prescribed standards, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury, and any related liability, resulting from medical or hazardous materials. In addition, manufacturing methods and formulation changes for product candidates advancing towards commercialization carry the risk that such product candidates may perform differently and affect the results of planned clinical trials or other future clinical trials conducted with the altered materials. While such changes are common and intended to help optimize processes and results during the development process, any of these changes could increase costs, cause delays and impact our ability, or our strategic partners&#8217; ability, to commence product sales and generate revenue.

Strategic transactions could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders and otherwise harm our business. 

We actively evaluate various strategic transactions on an ongoing basis. For example, we may acquire other businesses, products or technologies as well as pursue strategic alliances, joint ventures, investments in complementary businesses, out-licensing and in-licensing agreements, divestitures or other transactions. Any of these transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results and expose us to many risks, including: 

&#8226; disruption in our relationships with existing strategic partners or suppliers as a result of such a transaction; 

&#8226; unanticipated liabilities related to acquired companies; 

&#8226; difficulties integrating acquired personnel, technologies and operations into our existing business; 

&#8226; retention of key employees; 

&#8226; diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to management of strategic alliances or joint ventures or acquisition integration challenges; 

&#8226; risks and uncertainties associated with the other party to such a transaction, including the prospects of that party and their existing products or product candidates and marketing approvals; 

&#8226; increases in our expenses and reductions in our cash available for operations and other uses; and 

&#8226; possible write-offs or impairment charges relating to acquired businesses. 

Also, the anticipated benefit of any strategic transaction may not materialize or such strategic transaction may be prohibited. Any future acquisitions or dispositions could result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. We cannot predict the number, timing or size of any future strategic alliances, joint ventures, investments, acquisitions, divestitures or other strategic transactions, or the effect that any such transactions might have on our operating results. 

Security breaches and incidents, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business or protected health information or prevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation. 

In the ordinary course of our business, we and our CROs and other service providers collect, store and otherwise process petabytes of sensitive data, including legally protected health information, personal information, intellectual property and proprietary business information owned or controlled by ourselves or our strategic partners. We manage and maintain our applications and data by using a combination of on-site systems, managed data center systems and cloud-based data center systems. These applications and data encompass a wide variety of business-critical information, including research and development information, commercial information and business and financial information. We face four primary risks relative to protecting this critical information: loss of access risk, inappropriate disclosure risk, inappropriate modification risk and the risk of being unable to adequately monitor our controls over the first three risks. 

Although we take measures designed to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure and those that our CROs and our other third-party service providers may use in the past have been subject to, and may be vulnerable to, attacks by hackers or other third parties, viruses, ransomware or other malicious code, or other breaches, incidents, outages, interruptions, compromises or vulnerabilities due to inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, contractors, business partners, and/or other third parties, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties (including supply chain cyber-attacks or the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of systems or information). The risks of these types of incidents and other matters occurring may be heightened in connection with geopolitical events. Any such breach, incident, outage, interruption, compromise or vulnerability could compromise systems and networks used in our business and lead to system and other operational outages, interruptions and disruptions and the loss, destruction, alteration, prevention of access to, disclosure, or dissemination of, or damage or unauthorized access to, our data (including trade secrets or other confidential information, intellectual property, proprietary business information, and personal information) or data that is maintained or otherwise processed on our behalf, or other assets, which could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. Any such event could result in legal claims, demands and litigation or governmental investigations or other proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;), and regulatory penalties and other liabilities. Although we have implemented security measures and a formal enterprise security program designed to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data, and make use of third-party service providers to perform certain operational and security functions on our behalf, 

Table of Contents 

there is no guarantee that we or our third-party service providers ca n, or have been able to, protect our systems or networks or other systems or networks used in our business from security breaches, incidents, outages, interruptions, compromises, or vulnerabilities, or that we or they have been or will be able to identify, identify the cause of or otherwise respond to any actual or potential security breach, incident, outage, interruption, compromise or vulnerability. We have engaged in efforts to improve our security measures, and we expect to continue to incur additional expenses in further efforts to do so, whether in response to actual or perceived security breaches or incidents, compromises, outages, interruptions, vulnerabilities or otherwise. Any loss, destruction, alteration, prevention of access to, disclosure, or dissemination of, or damage or unauthorized access to, our data or other data that is processed or maintained on our behalf could also disrupt our operations (including our ability to conduct our analyses, pay providers, conduct research and development activities, collect, process and prepare company financial information, provide information about any future products, and manage the administrative aspects of our business) and damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business. 

HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (&#8220;HITECH&#8221;), and its implementing regulations, impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security, transmission and breach reporting of individually identifiable health information. Penalties for HIPAA violations can be significant, and criminal and monetary penalties, as well as injunctive relief, may be imposed for HIPAA violations. Most drug manufacturers are not directly subject to HIPAA, but prosecutors increasingly are using HIPAA-related theories of liability against drug manufacturers and their agents and we also could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain individually identifiable health information from a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. 

Furthermore, HIPAA regulations impose specific reporting requirements to regulators, individuals impacted by the breach, as defined by HIPAA, and, in some cases, the media. Issuing such notifications can be costly, time and resource intensive, and can generate significant negative publicity. In addition to HIPAA, other applicable data privacy and security obligations may require us to notify relevant stakeholders of any security breaches or incidents that result in the unauthorized disclosure, or dissemination of, personal information. Such disclosures are costly, and the disclosures or the failure to comply with such requirements, could lead to adverse impacts. 

Furthermore, the loss, corruption, or unavailability of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on other third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates and to conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their computer systems or otherwise relating to their collection, storage, or processing of data could also have a material adverse effect on our business. 

We are subject to stringent and changing obligations related to privacy and security. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could lead to regulatory investigations or actions, litigation, fines and penalties, disruptions of our business operations, reputational harm and other adverse business consequences. 

U.S. states have enacted and are considering enacting laws relating to the protection of personal information (including health and other data of patients, research subjects, and other individuals), which may be more rigorous than, or impose additional requirements beyond those required by, HIPAA. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (&#8220;CCPA&#8221;), which became effective in January 2020, gives California consumers expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA allows for statutory fines for noncompliance (up to $7,500 per violation) as well as a limited private right of action for data breaches. The California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, which went into effect in January 2023, expanded the CCPA in numerous ways and established a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law. Many other privacy and security laws have been proposed at the federal level and in other states, certain of which impose obligations similar to the CCPA. Other privacy and security laws address specific subject matter, such as Washington&#8217;s My Health, My Data Act, which, among other things, provides for a private right of action. While limited exemptions to some of these laws may apply to portions of our business, these laws&#8217; recent enactment and evolving interpretations may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. These or other proposed or enacted laws relating to privacy and security could similarly increase our compliance obligations and costs in the future. 

We may also become subject to laws and regulations in non-U.S. countries covering privacy and security and the protection of health-related and other personal information. In particular, the European Economic Area (&#8220;EEA&#8221;), the UK, and Switzerland have adopted laws and regulations addressing privacy, data protection and security that impose significant compliance obligations. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent revisions and differing interpretations, and have generally become more stringent over time.

The General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;) applies to the processing of personal information and imposes numerous requirements, including, for example, high standards for obtaining consent, requirements for more robust disclosures to individuals and strengthened individual data rights, required data breach notifications, limitations on retention and secondary use of information, increased requirements pertaining to health data and pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data and additional obligations when contracting third-party data processors. The GDPR allows EEA countries to make additional laws and regulations further limiting the processing of genetic, biometric or health data. The GDPR provides for fines of up to &#8364;20.0 million or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties; further, the GDPR permits other forms of relief and recovery, and other national and local data protection laws provide for additional penalties and relief. Furthermore, adverse publicity relating to actual or alleged GDPR noncompliance could cause a loss of goodwill, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business and financial condition. The UK has implemented legislation similar to the GDPR, referred to as the UK GDPR, which provides for fines of up to the greater of &#163;17.5 million or 4% of global turnover. 

Certain jurisdictions, including the EEA, have enacted laws and regulations governing cross-border personal information transfer and providing for data localization in certain cases. For example, absent appropriate safeguards or other circumstances, the GDPR and laws in Switzerland and the UK generally restrict the transfer of personal information to countries outside the EEA, Switzerland and the UK, such as the United States. In July 2023, the European Commission adopted its adequacy decision for the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and generally permits personal information to flow from the EU to the United States by companies participating in the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. We are not certified under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and instead rely on other data transfer tools such as the EU standard contractual clauses (&#8220;EU SCCs&#8221;) and the UK addendum to the EU SCCs to transfer personal information to third countries outside the EEA and the UK, taking into consideration related obligations. To the extent we transfer personal information from other jurisdictions to the United States, we may not be able to implement or maintain an appropriate data transfer mechanism to continue such transfers. The U.S. Department of Justice also has issued rules regarding certain bulk sensitive personal data transfers. The interpretation of data transfer requirements, regulatory guidance and opinions, and other developments relating to cross-border data transfer may require us to implement additional contractual and technical safeguards for any personal information transferred out of the EEA, Switzerland, the UK, the United States, or other regions, which may increase compliance costs, lead to increased regulatory scrutiny or liability, and may require additional contractual negotiations, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition, and operating results. 

We expect an increase in regulatory requirements relating to privacy, data protection and cybersecurity that may apply to our business. For instance, the EU has enacted numerous laws and regulations addressing cybersecurity, including substantial revisions to its Network and Information Security directive that EU member states are required to reflect in national law. Requirements for hosting health data will vary by jurisdiction within EEA countries and the UK, and we may be or become subject to other national healthcare regulations or regulatory requirements. For example, France requires hosts of health data to obtain a prior certification with the competent certification body. 

The interpretation and application of consumer, health-related and privacy, data protection and security laws in the United States, the EEA, Switzerland, the UK and elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory and in flux. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, contractual or other legal obligations related to privacy or security may result in claims, warnings, communications, requests or investigations from individuals, supervisory authorities or other legal or regulatory authorities in relation to our processing of personal information, and regulatory investigations or other proceedings. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. If so, this could result in government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our practices, which could adversely affect our business. These privacy regulations vary between states, may differ from country to country, and may vary based on whether testing is performed in the United States or in the local country. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business. 

Current and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us or our strategic partners to commercialize any approved products that we or our strategic partners develop and affect the prices that may be obtained. 

The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change healthcare systems in ways that could affect our or our strategic partners&#8217; ability to sell any of our product candidates profitably, if such product candidates are approved for sale. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.

In March 2010, the PPACA became law in the United States. The PPACA may affect the operational results of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including us, by imposing on them additional costs. For example, effective January 2010, PPACA increased the minimum Medicaid drug rebates for pharmaceutical companies and imposed an annual fee on certain branded prescription drugs and biologics. Since the enactment of PPACA, there have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, including judicial challenges in the Fifth Circuit Court and the United States Supreme Court. In June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court held that Texas and other challengers had no legal standing to challenge the PPACA, dismissing the case without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the PPACA. Accordingly, the PPACA remains in effect in its current form. It is unclear how future litigation or healthcare measures promulgated by the Trump administration will impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Complying with any new legislation or changes in healthcare regulation could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business. 

Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. For example, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amended the PPACA, effective January 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans. The Budget Control Act of 2011, which calls for aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, began in 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2032 unless Congress takes further action. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on potential customers for zanidatamab or our product candidates, if approved, and, accordingly, our future financial operations. We are unable to predict the future course of federal or state health care legislation or foreign regulations relating to the marketing, pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products. 

There have been U.S. Congressional inquiries, presidential executive orders, and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. For example, under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, effective January 1, 2024, Medicaid statutory rebates are no longer be capped at 100% of AMP (average manufacturer price). Elimination of this cap may require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay more in rebates than it receives on the sale of products, which could have a material impact on our business. As discussed above, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes prescription drug provisions that have significant implications for the pharmaceutical industry and Medicare beneficiaries, including allowing the federal government to negotiate a maximum fair price for certain high-priced single-source Medicare drugs. The implementation of cost containment measures, including the prescription drug provisions under the Inflation Reduction Act, as well as other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our product candidates if approved. Complying with any new legislation and regulatory changes could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business. 

Further, many states have proposed or enacted legislation and administrative actions that seek to indirectly or directly regulate pharmaceutical drug pricing, such as by requiring biopharmaceutical manufacturers to publicly report proprietary pricing information or to place a maximum price ceiling on pharmaceutical products purchased by state agencies. For example, the FDA has authorized the state of Florida to develop a drug importation program to import certain prescription drugs from Canada for a limited period to help reduce drug costs, provided that Florida&#8217;s Agency for Health Care Administration meets the requirements set forth by the FDA. Other states may follow Florida. Additionally, a number of states are considering or have enacted state drug price transparency and reporting laws that could substantially increase compliance burdens and expose us to greater liability under such state laws once we begin commercialization after obtaining regulatory approval for any of our products candidates. We cannot be sure to what extent these and future legislative and regulatory efforts, whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. Increased scrutiny by Congress of the FDA&#8217;s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate, if approved, is prescribed or used. 

In the EU similar political, economic and regulatory developments may affect our ability to profitably commercialize any future products. In addition to continuing pressure on prices and cost containment measures, legislative developments at the EU or member state level may result in significant additional requirements or obstacles that may increase our operating costs. In

international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. Our future products, if any, might not be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication or cost-effective by third-party payors, an adequate level of reimbursement might not be available for such products, and third-party payors&#8217; reimbursement policies might adversely affect our or our strategic partners&#8217; ability to sell any future products profitably. 

We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or elsewhere. If we or our strategic partners are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we or our strategic partners are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, any approved products may lose any marketing approval that may have been obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business. 

Our business may become subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks associated with international operations. 

Our business, financial condition, and stock price may be adversely affected by economic downturns, a volatile business environment, or large-scale unpredictable or unstable or unfavorable market conditions, including a prolonged government shutdown, geopolitical events, or a global pandemic. If events like these occur, our business may be materially and adversely impacted, including making any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly and more dilutive. 

Our business is subject to risks associated with conducting business internationally. We have physical operations and personnel in North America, Europe and Asia. In addition, some of our suppliers and collaborative and clinical trial relationships are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including: 

&#8226; economic instability or weakness, including inflation, reduced growth, diminished credit availability, weakened consumer confidence or increased unemployment; 

&#8226; insta bility in the international geopolitical environment, including as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the conflicts in Israel and the broader Middle East; 

&#8226; sociopolitical instability in particular foreign economies and markets; 

&#8226; differing regulatory requirements for drug approvals in foreign countries; 

&#8226; potentially reduced protection for intellectual property rights; 

&#8226; difficulties in compliance with non-U.S. laws and regulations; 

&#8226; c hanges in non-U.S. regulations and customs, tariffs and trade barriers, including any changes that China may impose as a result of political tensions between Canada and China or the United States and China; 

&#8226; changes in non-U.S. currency exchange rates and currency controls; 

&#8226; trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements or other restrictive actions by U.S. or non-U.S. governments; 

&#8226; restrictions on cross-border data exchanges; 

&#8226; differing reimbursement regimes, including price controls; 

&#8226; negative consequences from changes in tax laws; 

&#8226; workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States; 

&#8226; production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities outside the United States; 

&#8226; business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires; and 

&#8226; supply and other disruptions resulting from the impact of public health epidemics on our strategic partners, third-party manufacturers, suppliers and other third parties upon which we rely. 

In particular, there is currently significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and various other countries, most significantly China, with respect to trade policies, treaties, tariffs, treatment of intellectual property, taxes, and other limitations on cross-border operations, including but not limited to the provision of services and the exchange of data. The U.S. government has made and continues to make significant additional changes in U.S. trade policy and may continue to take 

Table of Contents 

future actions that could negatively impact U.S. trade. For example, there have been legislative proposals that would limit the extension of certain specific types of government contracts or renewals, loans, or grants, to companies that may do business with select Chinese biotechnology equipment or service providers. If enacted, such legislation will preclude certain U.S. biotechnology companies from using equipment or services produced or provided by those Chinese biotechnology companies when performing on specified types of agreements with the U.S. government. Others in Congress have advocated for the use of existing executive branch authorities to limit certain Chinese service providers&#8217; ability to engage in business in the United States. We cannot predict whether any proposed legislation will be enacted, what executive actions may implicate these kinds of service relationships, or what other actions may ultimately be taken with respect to trade relations between the United States and China or other countries, including countries which the U.S. government has identified as a foreign adversary that poses national security risks to the United States. 

Relatedly, the United States has recently enacted and proposed to enact significant new tariffs. President Trump has directed various federal agencies to further evaluate key aspects of U.S. trade policy and there has been ongoing discussion and commentary regarding potential significant changes to U.S. trade policies, treaties and tariffs. There continues to exist significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and other countries with respect to such trade policies, treaties and tariffs. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between the impacted nations and the United States. Any of these factors could depress economic activity and restrict our access to third party services as well as disrupt the supply chain for the sourcing of our product candidates. If we or our partners are unable to obtain or use services from existing service providers, unable to source supplies of product candidates or approved drugs, or unable to export or sell approved products our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. 

Our business has been in the past and may in the future be adversely affected by public health outbreaks and pandemics. 

Our business has been in the past and may in the future be adversely affected by public health outbreaks and pandemics. If a public health outbreak or pandemic, including a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, leads to disruptions in our industry or to our service providers, particularly in regions where we or our strategic partners and suppliers do business, we could experience disruptions that could significantly impact our current and planned clinical trials, preclinical research and other business activities, including: 

&#8226; disruption to and delays in preclinical research activities due to extended closure or reduced capacity of lab facilities; 

&#8226; delays or difficulties in enrolling patients in our ongoing and planned clinical trials; 

&#8226; patients discontinuing their treatment or follow-up visits; 

&#8226; delays or difficulties in clinical site initiation, including limitations on access to sites, limitations to site initiation activities that can be carried out remotely, and limitations on the number of clinical site staff on site from time to time; 

&#8226; interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site monitoring, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers and others; 

&#8226; shortages, disruptions in supply, logistics or other activities related to the procurement of materials and other supplies, which could have a negative impact on our ability to conduct preclinical research, initiate or complete our clinical trials or commercialize our product candidates; 

&#8226; diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, including the diversion of hospitals serving as our clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of clinical trials; 

&#8226; interruption of key business activities due to illness and/or quarantine of key individuals and delays associated with recruiting, hiring and training new temporary or permanent replacements for such key individuals, both internally and at our third-party service providers and strategic partners; 

&#8226; limitations in resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our business or our current or planned clinical trials or preclinical research, including because of sickness, the desire to avoid contact with large groups of people, restrictions on travel, or prolonged stay-at-home or similar working arrangements; 

&#8226; delays in receiving approvals from regulatory authorities to initiate our planned clinical trials; 

&#8226; changes in regulations as part of a response to public health outbreaks, pandemics, or a resurgence of COVID-19 cases and related disruptions, which may require us to change the ways in which our clinical trials are conducted and incur unexpected costs, or require us to discontinue clinical trials altogether; 

Table of Contents 

&#8226; delays in necessary interactions with regulators (including the FDA), ethics committees and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or furlough of government or contractor personnel; 

&#8226; disruptions to our strategic partners&#8217; operations, which could delay the development of our product candidates in certain geographical regions and thereby affect the timing of development and commercial milestone payments and royalties on potential future product sales we may receive; and 

&#8226; limitations on our ability to recruit any necessary preclinical research, clinical, regulatory and other professional staff on the timeframe required to support our research and development programs. 

The impact of such disruptions would be highly uncertain and would depend on factors such as the location, duration and severity, travel restrictions and social distancing, business closures or disruptions, and the effectiveness of actions taken to contain and treat the disease and to address its impact, including on financial markets. Public health outbreaks, pandemics, and related disruptions could disrupt the global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could negatively affect our liquidity and could heighten the volatility of the financial markets, which could adversely impact the value of our common stock. 

Our business and current and future relationships with customers and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere will be subject, directly or indirectly, to applicable federal and state anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, transparency, health information privacy and security, and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, and diminished profits and future earnings. 

Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of zanidatamab and any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. 

Our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers, and third-party payors and other entities may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act, that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct clinical research on product candidates and market, sell and distribute any approved products. In addition, we may be subject to transparency laws and patient privacy regulation by the federal government and by the U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include the following: 

&#8226; the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid; 

&#8226; federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the federal False Claims Act, impose criminal or civil penalties, as applicable, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government (including the Medicare and Medicaid programs) or other third-party payor claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; 

&#8226; HIPAA established the federal offense of health care fraud, which among other things, imposes criminal liability for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g. public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters; 

&#8226; HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without the appropriate authorization by entities subject to the law, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and healthcare providers and their respective business associates and their covered subcontractors; 

&#8226; the federal Open Payments program under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under Section 6002 of the PPACA and its implementing regulations, requires applicable group purchasing organizations and manufacturers of 

Table of Contents 

drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to HHS information related to &#8220;payments or other transfers of value&#8221; made in the previous year to covered recipients, including physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors, other health care professionals (such as nurse practitioners and physician assistants) and teaching hospitals, and information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) or their immediate family members; and 

&#8226; analogous and similar state and foreign laws and regulations, including: state anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to our business practices (including research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by state governmental and non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers); state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry&#8217;s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; state laws that require drug manufacturers to track gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities and file reports relating to pricing and marketing information; and state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of any available statutory exceptions and safe harbors, it is possible that some of our current and future business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. 

Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws, regulations, or case law may result in governmental investigations or enforcement actions, litigation, claims and other proceedings, harm our reputation, and could result in significant liability. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of noncompliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business, including our strategic partners, is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, it may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from participation in government healthcare programs, which could also materially affect our business. 

We are subject to U.S. and certain foreign export and import controls, sanctions, embargoes, anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Compliance with these legal standards could impair our ability to compete in domestic and international markets. We can face criminal liability and other serious consequences for violations that can harm our business. 

In addition to potential risks discussed above at the risk factor entitled &#8220; Our business may become subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks associated with international operations &#8221;, we are subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations, various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Controls, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the UK Bribery Act 2010, the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, and other state and national anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, contractors, and other partners from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or anything else of value to recipients in the public or private sector. We currently engage third parties for clinical trials outside of the United States and we may in the future engage third parties to sell our products outside of the United States once we enter a commercialization phase, or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent registrations, and other regulatory approvals. We may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities, and other organizations. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees, agents, contractors, and other partners, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. Any violation of the laws and regulations described above may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, the loss of export or import privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other consequences.

Third-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with U.S. export control regulations, cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in a necessity to replace current third parties, resulting in the possibility of supply delays, clinical holds on our trials, sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocations, seizures or recalls of product candidates or medicines, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our medicines and harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. 

Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital 

We have incurred significant losses since inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We have only one product approved for commercial sale, and, as of December 31, 2024, we have not received any revenue or profit from product sales. We may never achieve or sustain profitability. 

We have incurred significant losses since our inception. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $122.7 million and $118.7 million, respectively, while our net income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $124.3 million, which was driven in large part by our entry into the Original Jazz Collaboration Agreement (as defined below) and the receipt of certain payments thereunder, and we do not anticipate being net income positive on a regular basis for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2024, our accumulated deficit was $830.3 million. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future as we continue our research and development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates, prepare for and begin to commercialize any approved product candidates and add infrastructure, which may include personnel, to support our product development efforts. In addition, inflationary pressure could adversely impact our financial results. The net losses and negative cash flows incurred as of December 31, 2024, together with expected future losses, have had, and likely will continue to have, an adverse effect on our stockholders&#8217; deficit and working capital. The amount of future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenue, including through the receipt of royalties from our strategic partners. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. 

To become and remain profitable, we or our strategic partners must succeed in developing and commercializing product candidates with significant market potential. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities for which we are only in the preliminary stages, including developing product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for such product candidates, and manufacturing, marketing and selling those product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval. We may never succeed in these activities and may never generate revenue from product sales or royalties that is significant enough to achieve profitability. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Our failure to become or remain profitable would depress our market value and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, develop other product candidates, or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause our stockholders to lose all or part of their investment. 

Biopharmaceutical prod uct development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of uncertainty. We have never received any revenue from product sales and may never be profitable. 

We have devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to developing our proprietary therapeutic platforms, identifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials. Zanidatamab is the only product candidate developed with our therapeutic platforms that has received regulatory approval, and we and our strategic partners are still developing other product candidates. Our revenue as of December 31, 2024 has been primarily revenue from the license of our proprietary therapeutic platforms for the development of product candidates by others or revenue from our strategic partners. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends in large part on our ability, alone or with our strategic partners, to achieve milestones and to successfully complete the development of, obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for, and commercialize, product candidates. While we anticipate receiving royalties from sales of zanidatamab, we do not anticipate generating revenue from sales of our wholly-owned product candidates in the near term. 

We will require substantial additional funding, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, and, if not available, may require us to delay, scale back, or cease our product development programs or operations. 

We currently have two clinical-stage product candidates, ZW171 and ZW191. We have licensed zanidatamab to our strategic partner Jazz, which has been responsible for completing its clinical development in the United States and other jurisdictions not covered by our license to BeiGene. In November 2024, Jazz announced the FDA granted accelerated approval for Ziihera &#174; for injection for intravenous use for the treatment of adults with previously treated, unresectable or metastatic HER2+ (IHC 3+) BTC. Jazz is conducting the confirmatory trial for Ziihera &#174; related to the accelerated approval. If the confirmatory trial fails to 

Table of Contents 

demonstrate a clinical benefit, FDA may remove Ziihera &#174; from the market, which would negatively impact our ability to earn milestone payments and royalties under our arrangement with Jazz. We are focused on the development of our early-stage product candidates and general discovery efforts. Following the clearance of our IND applications for both ZW171 and ZW191, we are actively progressing with additional submissions in selected non-U.S. countries in relation to our Phase 1 study sites in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. 

D eveloping pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is expensive. In order to obtain regulatory approval, we will be required to conduct clinical trials for each indication for each of our product candidates. Although our collaboration agreements with Jazz and BeiGene provide for additional future funding for zanidatamab, we will continue to require additional funding to advan ce and complete the development of our other product candidates, and such funding may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. If sufficient funds on acceptable terms are not available when needed, or at all, we could be forced to significantly reduce operating expenses and delay, scale back or eliminate one or more of our development programs or our business operations. 

Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including: 

&#8226; the number and characteristics of other product candidates that we pursue; 

&#8226; the scope, progress, timing, cost and results of research, preclinical development, and clinical trials; 

&#8226; the costs, timing and outcome of seeking and obtaining FDA and non-U.S. regulatory approvals; 

&#8226; the costs associated with manufacturing our product candidates and establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities; 

&#8226; our ability to maintain, expand and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make in connection with the licensing, filing, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights; 

&#8226; our ability to hire when needed additional management, scientific and medical personnel; 

&#8226; the effect of competing products that may limit market penetration of our product candidates; 

&#8226; our need to implement additional internal systems and infrastructure, including financial and reporting systems; and 

&#8226; the economic and other terms, timing of and success of our existing strategic partnerships, and any collaboration, asset monetization, licensing, or other arrangements into which we may enter in the future, including the timing of receipt of any milestone or royalty payments under these agreements. 

Until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to finance our cash requirements, which we may never do, we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through a combination of public and private equity offerings, debt financings, asset monetization, strategic partnerships and grant funding. 

Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish substantial rights. 

To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders&#8217; ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these new securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders&#8217; rights as common stockholders. For example, from time to time, we have entered into &#8220;at-the-market&#8221; equity offering programs to sell shares of our common stock including in August 2024, our entry into the Cowen Sales Agreement with TD Cowen as sales agent to sell shares of our common stock, subject to a maximum aggregate dollar amount registered pursuant to an applicable prospectus supplement. As part of the ongoing management of our operations and related funding needs, we evaluate various financing vehicles, including &#8220;at-the-market&#8221; equity offering programs, and may enter into similar &#8220;at-the-market&#8221; equity offering programs in the future, as well as other financing transactions. Debt financing, if available at all, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through partnerships, collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, product candidates, or future revenue streams, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. We cannot assure that we will be able to obtain additional funding if and when necessary. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing on a timely basis, we could be required to delay, scale back or eliminate one or more of our development programs or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.

Our effective tax rate may change in the future. 

We are subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our earnings and the earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries in a manner that may adversely impact our effective tax rate. For example, we have had to include additional amounts in income (such as interest income) under the so-called &#8220;global intangible low-taxed income&#8221; regime and may be required to do so in the future under the &#8220;global intangible low-taxed income&#8221; regime or as a result of the application of &#8220;controlled foreign corporation&#8221; rules. The United States has enacted the Inflation Reduction Act, which, among other changes, imposes a 1% excise tax on certain stock buybacks and an alternative minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income. In addition, our Canadian tax attributes (including net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and deductible Scientific Research and Experimental Development Expenditure carryforwards) will generally not be available to offset U.S. income and may be subject to limitation. Further, our future operations and business structure may result in increased tax burden. For example, changes in our clinical development plans and business or commercialization strategies may result in an increased effective tax rate. Taxation of international business operations and intercompany transactions, including transactions between us and non-U.S. subsidiaries, is complicated and our expenses may increase as a result of any steps we take to enhance our compliance efforts. Any changes in the U.S. or non-U.S. taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties 

We depend on our collaborative relationship with Jazz to further develop and commercialize zanidatamab, and if our relationship is not successful or is terminated, we may be delayed in or unable to effectively develop and/or commercialize zanidatamab, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

In October 2022, Zymeworks BC entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement (the &#8220;Original Jazz Collaboration Agreement&#8221;) with Jazz, under which Jazz obtained development and commercialization rights of zanidatamab throughout the world, but excluding certain territories already covered by Zymeworks BC&#8217;s agreement with BeiGene. In April 2023, certain of our subsidiaries entered into a stock and asset purchase agreement with Jazz Inc. (as amended, the &#8220;Transfer Agreement&#8221;). Pursuant to the terms of the Transfer Agreement, we took a series of steps designed to simplify, focus, and potentially expedite the clinical development and commercialization of zanidatamab in partnership with Jazz by transferring certain assets, contracts and employees associated with our zanidatamab development program to Jazz and its affiliates (the &#8220;Program&#8221;). As part of the transactions contemplated by the Transfer Agreement, at the closing of the Transfer Agreement in May 2023, Zymeworks BC and Jazz amended and restated the Original Jazz Collaboration Agreement to reflect the transfer of responsibility for the Program (as amended, the &#8220;Amended Jazz Collaboration Agreement&#8221;). Under the Amended Jazz Collaboration Agreement, the financial terms of the Original Jazz Collaboration Agreement, as previously disclosed, were unchanged, except that the costs of the Program (including ongoing costs related to the service providers transferred to Jazz purs uant to the Transfer Agreement) incurred following the closing of the Transfer Agreement are directly borne by Jazz instead of being incurred by us and charged back to Jazz for reimbursement, though Zymeworks BC remains eligible for reimbursement of certain costs for activities where Zymeworks BC maintains responsibility under the Amended Jazz Collaboration Agreement. Other material terms in the Amended Jazz Collaboration Agreement also remain substantially similar to the terms of the Original Jazz Collaboration Agreement, including commercialization, term and termination, and certain other customary terms and conditions, including mutual representations and warranties, indemnification, and confidentiality provisions. We cannot be certain that our amended arrangement with Jazz will simplify, focus, or potentially expedite the clinical development and commercialization of zanidatamab in partnership with Jazz. We continue to depend on Jazz to collaborate with us to develop and commercialize zanidatamab in the territories covered by the Amended Jazz Collaboration Agreement and, as a result, the eventual success or commercial viability of zanidatamab is largely beyond our control. Any future financial returns to us depend in large part on achievement of regulatory and commercialization milestones, plus a share of any revenue from sales. Therefore, our success, and any associated financial returns to us and our investors, will depend in significant part on Jazz&#8217;s performance under the Amended Jazz Collaboration Agreement. 

We are subject to a number of additional specific risks associated with our dependence on our collaborative relationship with Jazz, including: 

&#8226; adverse decisions by Jazz regarding the development and commercialization of zanidatamab; 

&#8226; Jazz&#8217;s ability to manufacture, directly or through third parties, commercially required quantities of zanidatamab in a timely manner or at all; 

&#8226; Jazz&#8217;s compliance with ongoing post-marketing obligations, including completion of the confirmatory trial for zanidatamab; 

Table of Contents 

&#8226; possible disagreements as to the timing, nature and extent of development plans, including clinical trials or regulatory approval strategy; 

&#8226; loss of significant rights if we fail to meet our obligations under the agreement; 

&#8226; changes in key management personnel at Jazz; 

&#8226; possible disagreements with Jazz regarding the agreement, for example, with regard to ownership of intellectual property rights or program costs and reimbursement matters; and 

&#8226; Jazz may not perform its obligations as expected. 

In November 2024, Jazz announced the FDA granted accelerated approval for Ziihera &#174; for injection for intravenous use for the treatment of adults with previously treated, unresectable or metastatic HER2+ (IHC 3+) BTC. Jazz is conducting the confirmatory trial for Ziihera &#174; related to the accelerated approval. If the confirmatory trial fails to demonstrate a clinical benefit, the FDA may remove Ziihera &#174; from the market, which would negatively impact our ability to earn milestone payments and royalties under our arrangement with Jazz. In addition, although Jazz is developing zanidatamab for regulatory approval in additional indications, such regulatory approval may never be achieved. If additional indications are not approved, our ability to achieve additional milestone payments and royalties on sales of zanidatamab will be materially and negatively impacted. Jazz is also subject to the risks relating to development and commercialization of product candidates or approved products discussed elsewhere in this &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section, which could restrict Jazz&#8217;s ability to further develop and commercialize zanidatamab and negatively impact our ability to achieve milestone payments and royalties. 

If either we or Jazz fail to perform our respective obligations, any clinical trial, regulatory approval or development progress could be significantly delayed or halted, could result in costly or time-consuming litigation or arbitration and could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we depend on Jazz to provide certain information to us regarding the Program, and any delay by Jazz in fulfilling its information-sharing obligations under the Amended Collaboration Agreement could impact our understanding of the status of the Program, as well as result in potential delays or inaccuracies in our disclosures relating to the Program. 

Decisions by Jazz to emphasize other drug candidates currently in its portfolio ahead of zanidatamab, or to add competitive agents to its portfolio could result in a decision to terminate the agreement, in which event, among other things, we may be responsible for paying any remaining costs of ongoing or future clinical trials. If Jazz decides to terminate the Amended Jazz Collaboration Agreement, we may be delayed in or unable to effectively develop and/or commercialize zanidatamab, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any of the above discussed scenarios could adversely affect the timing and extent of the development and commercialization activities related to zanidatamab, which could materially and adversely impact our business. 

Our existing strategic partnerships are important to our business, and future strategic partnerships will likely also be important to us. If we are unable to maintain our strategic partnerships, or if these strategic partnerships are not successful, our business could be adversely affected. 

We have limited capabilities for drug development and commercialization of our product candidates, if approved. Accordingly, we have entered into strategic partnerships with other companies that we believe can provide such capabilities, including our collaboration and license agreements with Jazz, BeiGene, BMS, GSK, Daiichi Sankyo, Janssen and Merck. These relationships also have provided us with non-dilutive funding for our wholly-owned pipeline and therapeutic platforms and we expect to receive additional funding under these strategic partnerships in the future. Our existing strategic partnerships, and any future strategic partnerships we enter into, may pose a number of risks, including the following: 

&#8226; strategic partners have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these partnerships; 

&#8226; strategic partners may not perform their obligations as expected; 

&#8226; strategic partners may not pursue development and commercialization of any product candidates that achieve regulatory approval or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the partners&#8217; strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities; 

&#8226; strategic partners may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing; 

Table of Contents 

&#8226; strategic partners could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our product candidates if the strategic partners believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than our product candidates; 

&#8226; product candidates discovered in collaboration with us may be viewed by our strategic partners as competitive with their own product candidates or products, which may cause strategic partners to cease to devote resources to the commercialization of our product candidates; 

&#8226; a strategic partner with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our product candidates that achieve regulatory approval may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product candidates; 

&#8226; disagreements with strategic partners, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development, might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive; 

&#8226; we may be dependent on strategic partners to provide certain information to us regarding the development of product candidates, and any delay by our strategic partners to full information-sharing obligations could impact our understanding of such development, as well as result in potential delays or inaccuracies in our disclosures; 

&#8226; strategic partners may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation; 

&#8226; strategic partners may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability; 

&#8226; strategic partnerships may be terminated for the convenience of the partner and, if terminated, we could be required to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates. For example, each of our collaboration and license agreements with Jazz, BeiGene, BMS, GSK, Daiichi Sankyo, Janssen and Merck may be terminated for convenience upon the completion of a specified notice period; 

&#8226; we may elect to enter into additional licensing or collaboration agreements to partner our product candidates in territories we currently retain, and in the event we grant exclusive rights to such partners, we would be precluded from potential commercialization of our product candidates within the territories in which we have a partner; and 

&#8226; strategic partners may not have the ability or the development capabilities to perform their obligations as expected, including as a result of the impact of a pandemic or epidemic on our strategic partners&#8217; operations or business. 

In addition, our strategic partners are subject to the risks relating to development and commercialization of product candidates discussed elsewhere in this &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section, which could limit their ability to develop and commercialize product candidates and negatively impact our ability to achieve milestone, royalty or other contractual payments. 

If our strategic partnerships do not result in the successful development and commercialization of product candidates or if one of our partners terminates its agreement with us, we may not receive any future research funding or milestone or royalty payments under the collaboration. If we do not receive the funding we expect under our strategic partnership agreements, our development of our therapeutic platforms and product candidates could be delayed and we may need additional resources to develop product candidates and our therapeutic platforms. 

We face significant competition in seeking new strategic partners. 

For some of our product candidates, we may in the future determine to collaborate with additional pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for development and potential commercialization of therapeutic products. Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the strategic partner&#8217;s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed strategic partner&#8217;s evaluation of a number of factors. These factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions generally. The strategic partner may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate. 

Table of Contents 

Strategic partnerships are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future strategic partners. If we are unable to reach agreements with suitable strategic partners on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay one or more of our other development programs, delay potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to fund and undertake development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to enter into strategic partnerships and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary development and commercialization activities, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market or continue to develop our therapeutic platforms and our business may be materially and adversely affected. 

We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce our product candidates and on other third parties to provide supplies and store, monitor and transport bulk drug substance and drug product. We and our third-party partners may encounter difficulties with respect to these activities that could delay or impair our ability to initiate or complete our clinical trials or commercialize products. 

We do not currently own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We rely on our strategic partners to manufacture product candidates licensed to them or work with multiple third-party contract manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of materials required for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical testing and clinical trials, in compliance with applicable regulatory and quality standards, and intend to do so for the commercial manufacture of our products. If we are unable to arrange for such third-party manufacturing sources, or fail to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to successfully produce sufficient supply of product candidate or we may be delayed in doing so. Such failure or substantial delay could materially harm our business. 

The manufacture of biopharmaceutical products is complex and requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. The process of manufacturing our product candidates is susceptible to product loss due to contamination, equipment failure or improper installation or operation of equipment, vendor or operator error, inconsistency in yields, variability in product characteristics and difficulties in scaling the production process. Even minor deviations from normal manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects and other supply disruptions. If microbial, viral or other contaminations are discovered in our product candidates or in the third-party manufacturing facilities in which our product candidates are made, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination. All of our engineered antibodies are manufactured in accordance with cGMP by utilizing cells that are stored in a cell bank. We have one master cell bank and one working cell bank for zanidatama b and one master cell bank for each of ZW191 and ZW171. S hould any cell bank be lost in a catastrophic event, it is possible that we could lose part of a cell bank and have our manufacturing potentially impacted by the need to replace the cell bank. Any adverse developments affecting manufacturing operations for our product candidates, if any are approved, may result in shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, product withdrawals or recalls, or other interruptions in the supply of our products. We may also have to take inventory write-offs and incur other charges and expenses for products that fail to meet specifications, undertake costly remediation efforts or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives. 

Furthermore, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured product candidates ourselves, including reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality control and assurance, volume production, the possibility of breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control (including a failure to manufacture our product candidates in accordance with our product specifications) and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or damaging to us. In addition, the FDA, EMA and other regulatory authorities require that our product candidates be manufactured according to cGMP and similar foreign standards. Pharmaceutical manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their facilities or products manufactured at the time of submission of the marketing application and then annually thereafter with the FDA and certain state and foreign agencies. They are also subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, state and other foreign authorities. Any subsequent discovery of problems with a product, or a manufacturing or laboratory facility used by us or our strategic partners, may result in restrictions on the product or on the manufacturing or laboratory facility, including marketed product recall, suspension of manufacturing, product seizure, or a voluntary withdrawal of the drug from the market. We may have little to no control regarding the occurrence of third-party manufacturer incidents. Any failure by our third-party manufacturers to comply with cGMP or failure to scale up manufacturing processes, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities of product candidates in a timely manner, could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval of any of our product candidates. 

Table of Contents 

In addition to third-party manufacturers, we rely on other third parties to store, monitor and transport bulk drug substance and drug product. If we are unable to arrange for such third-party sources, or fail to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to successfully supply sufficient product candidate or we may be delayed in doing so. Such failure or substantial delay could materially harm our business. 

In addition, disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure, as were experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in shortages or delays impacting the availability of materials and other supplies, which could negatively impact our manufacturers, suppliers and other third parties on whom we rely. While we did not suffer any direct, material negative impacts from these supply chain disruptions, we cannot be certain that we will not be impacted by similar disruptions in the future, which could increase our costs or negatively impact our development timelines. 

We rely on third parties to monitor, support, conduct and oversee clinical trials of the product candidates that we are developing and, in some cases, to maintain regulatory files for those product candidates. We may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates or commercialize any products that may result from our development efforts if we are not able to maintain or secure agreements with such third parties on acceptable terms, if these third parties do not perform their services as required, or if these third parties fail to timely transfer any regulatory information held by them to us. 

We rely on entities outside of our control, which may include academic institutions, CROs, hospitals, clinics and other third-party strategic partners, to monitor, support, conduct and oversee preclinical studies and clinical trials of our current and future product candidates. We also rely on third parties to perform clinical trials on our current and future product candidates when they reach that stage. As a result, we have less control over the timing and cost of these studies and the ability to recruit trial subjects than if we conducted these trials with our own personnel. 

If we are unable to maintain or enter into agreements with these third parties on acceptable terms, or if any such engagement is terminated prematurely, we may be unable to enroll patients on a timely basis or otherwise conduct our trials in the manner we anticipate. In addition, there is no guarantee that these third parties will devote adequate time and resources to our studies or perform as required by our contract or in accordance with regulatory requirements, including maintenance of clinical trial information regarding our product candidates. These third parties, in turn, may face their own constraints in obtaining the resources and personnel needed to perform the work for which we engage them. If these third parties fail to meet expected deadlines, fail to transfer to us any regulatory information in a timely manner, fail to adhere to protocols or fail to act in accordance with regulatory requirements or our agreements with them, or if they otherwise perform in a substandard manner or in a way that compromises the quality or accuracy of their activities or the data they obtain, then clinical trials of our product candidates may be extended or delayed with additional costs incurred, or our data may be rejected by the FDA, EMA or other regulatory agencies. 

Ultimately, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. 

We and our CROs are required to comply with GCP regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, the competent authorities of the member states of the EU and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for products in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCP regulations through periodic inspections of clinical trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCP regulations, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and our submission of marketing applications may be delayed or the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. Upon inspection, the FDA could determine that any of our clinical trials fail or have failed to comply with applicable GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under the cGMP regulations enforced by the FDA, and our clinical trials may require a large number of test subjects. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process and increase our costs. Moreover, our business may be implicated if any of our CROs violates federal or state fraud and abuse or false claims laws and regulations or healthcare privacy and security laws. 

If any of our clinical trial sites terminate for any reason, we may experience the loss of follow-up information on patients enrolled in our ongoing clinical trials unless we are able to transfer the care of those patients to another qualified clinical trial site. Further, if our relationship with any of our CROs is terminated, we may be unable to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. 

Table of Contents 

Switching or adding CROs or other suppliers can involve substantial cost and require extensive management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO or supplier commences work. As a result, delays may occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. If we are required to seek alternative supply arrangements, the resulting delays and potential inability to find a suitable replacement could materially and adversely impact our business. 

We rely on third parties for various operational and administrative aspects of our business, including for certain cloud-based software platforms, which impact our financial, operational and research activities. If any of these third parties fail to provide timely, accurate and ongoing service or if the cloud-based platforms suffer outages that we are unable to mitigate, our business may be adversely affected. 

We currently rely upon third-party consultants and contractors to provide certain operational and administrative services, including external financial, legal, information technology, clinical and research consultation. The failure of any of these third parties to provide accurate and timely service may adversely impact our business operations. In addition, if such third-party service providers were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, face financial distress or other business disruption, or increase their fees, or if our relationships with these providers deteriorate, we could suffer increased costs until an equivalent provider could be found, if at all, or we could develop internal capabilities, if ever. If we are unsuccessful in choosing or finding high-quality partners, if we fail to negotiate cost-effective relationships with them, or if we ineffectively manage these relationships, it could have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance. 

Further, our operations depend on the continuing and efficient operation of our information technology and communications systems and infrastructure, and specifically on &#8220;cloud-based&#8221; platforms. These platforms are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, vandalism, sabotage, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power outages, telecommunications failures, and computer viruses or other deliberate attempts to harm the systems. The occurrence of a natural or intentional disaster, any decision to close a facility we are using without adequate notice, or particularly an unanticipated problem at our cloud-based virtual server facility, could result in harmful interruptions in our service, resulting in adverse effects to our business. 

Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property 

Our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. 

Our success will depend in part on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Other entities may have or obtain patents or proprietary rights that could limit our ability to make, use, sell, offer for sale or import our future approved products or impair our competitive position. For example, certain patents and patent applications held by third parties cover Fab and Fc region engineering methods for bispecific antibodies, and antibodies having mutations in Fab heavy and light chain regions and Fc regions to generate correctly paired bispecific antibodies. If our products or our strategic partners&#8217; products incorporate any Fab or Fc region mutations covered by any claims of these patents or patents that may issue from these applications, and if licenses for them are not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and we are unable to invalidate or render unenforceable those patents, our business could be materially harmed. 

There is no assurance that there are not third-party patents or patent applications of which we are aware, but which we do not believe are relevant to our business, which may, nonetheless, ultimately be found to limit our ability to make, use, sell, offer for sale or import our future approved products or impair our competitive position. 

Patents that we may ultimately be found to infringe could be issued to third parties. Third parties may have or obtain valid and enforceable patents or proprietary rights that could block us from developing product candidates using our technology. Our failure to obtain a license to any patent covering any technology that we require may materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, our failure to maintain a license to any patent covering any technology that we require may also materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we would be exposed to a threat of litigation. 

In the pharmaceutical industry, significant litigation and other proceedings regarding patents, patent applications, trademarks and other intellectual property rights are commonplace. Any such lawsuits and proceedings could be costly and could affect our results of operations and divert the attention of our management and scientific personnel. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the cost of such litigation and proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater resources. There is a risk that a court would decide that we or our strategic partners are infringing a third party&#8217;s patents and would order us or our strategic partners to stop the activities or stop the manufacture, use, or sale of any product covered by the 

Table of Contents 

patents. In that event, we or our strategic partners may not have a viable alternative to the technology protected by the patent and may need to halt work on the affected product candidate or cease commercialization of an approved product. In addition, there is a risk that a court would order us or our strategic partners to pay third-party damages or some other monetary award, depending upon the jurisdiction. An adverse outcome in any litigation or other proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, potentially including treble damages and attorneys&#8217; fees if we are found to have willfully infringed, and we may be required to cease using the technology that is at issue or to license the technology from third parties. We may not be able to obtain any required licenses on commercially acceptable terms or at all. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

If we are unable to obtain, maintain and enforce patent and trade secret protection for our product candidates and related technology, our business could be materially harmed. 

Our strategy depends on our ability to identify and seek patent protection for our discoveries. This process is expensive and time consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner or in all jurisdictions where protection may be commercially advantageous. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, in some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology that we have licensed from third parties. Therefore, our owned or in-licensed patents and patent applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. Our patent applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless, and until, patents issue from such applications, and then only to the extent the issued claims cover the technology. The patent applications that we own or in-license may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover our current and future product candidates in the United States or in other countries. 

Moreover, the patent position of biopharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has been the subject of much litigation. The issuance of a patent does not ensure that it is valid or enforceable. Third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of our issued patents, and such patents may be narrowed, invalidated, circumvented, or deemed unenforceable. In addition, changes in law may introduce uncertainty in the enforceability or scope of patents owned by biotechnology companies. If our patents are narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, third parties may be able to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us without payment to us. There is no assurance that all potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found, and such prior art could potentially invalidate one or more of our patents or prevent a patent from issuing from one or more of our pending patent applications. There is also no assurance that there is not prior art of which we are aware, but which we do not believe affects the validity or enforceability of a claim in our patents and patent applications, which may, nonetheless, ultimately be found to affect the validity or enforceability of a claim. 

Furthermore, even if our patents are unchallenged, they may not adequately protect our intellectual property, provide exclusivity for our product candidates, prevent others from designing around our claims or provide us with a competitive advantage. The legal systems of certain countries do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents, and the laws of other countries may not allow us to protect our inventions with patents to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Because patent applications in the United States and many other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all, and because publications of discoveries in scientific literature lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our issued patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for protection of the inventions set forth in our patents or patent applications. As a result, we may not be able to obtain or maintain protection for certain inventions. Therefore, the issuance, validity, enforceability, scope and commercial value of our patents in the United States and in other countries cannot be predicted with certainty and, as a result, any patents that we own or license may not provide sufficient protection against competitors. We may not be able to obtain or maintain patent protection from our pending patent applications, from those we may file in the future, or from those we may license from third parties. Moreover, even if we are able to obtain patent protection, such patent protection may be of insufficient scope to achieve our business objectives. In addition, the issuance of a patent does not give us the right to practice the patented invention. Third parties may have blocking patents that could prevent us from marketing our own patented product and practicing our own patented technology. 

Our patents covering one or more of our products or product candidates could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged. 

Any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged or invalidated despite measures we take to obtain patent and other intellectual property protection with respect to our product candidates and proprietary technology. These challenges could be 

Table of Contents 

initiated in the courts or administratively in various patent offices. For example, if we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid and/or unenforceable or file an administrative action to invalidate our patent. In patent litigation in the United States and in some other jurisdictions, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, for example, lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld material information from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (&#8220;USPTO&#8221;) or the applicable foreign counterpart, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. A litigant or the USPTO itself could challenge our patents on this basis even if we believe that we have conducted our patent prosecution in accordance with the duty of candor and in good faith. The outcome following such a challenge is unpredictable. 

With respect to challenges to the validity of our patents, for example, there might be invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on a product candidate. Even if a defendant does not prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, our patent claims may be construed in a manner that would limit our ability to enforce such claims against the defendant and others. The cost of defending such a challenge, and any resulting loss of patent protection, could have a material adverse impact on one or more of our product candidates and our business. 

Enforcing our intellectual property rights against third parties may also cause such third parties to file other counterclaims against us, which could be costly to defend and could require us to pay substantial damages, cease the use, manufacture, or sale of certain products or enter into a license agreement and pay royalties (which may not be possible on commercially reasonable terms or at all). Any efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights are also likely to be costly and may divert the efforts of our scientific and management personnel. 

Our intellectual property rights will not necessarily provide us with competitive advantages. 

The degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative: 

&#8226; others may be able to make compounds that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we or our strategic partners own or have exclusively licensed; 

&#8226; others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights; 

&#8226; issued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors; 

&#8226; we may obtain patents for certain compounds many years before we obtain marketing approval for products containing such compounds, and because patents have a limited life, which may begin to run prior to the commercial sale of the related product, the commercial value of our patents may be limited; 

&#8226; our competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets; 

&#8226; we may fail to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; 

&#8226; the laws of certain countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, or we may fail to apply for or obtain adequate intellectual property protection in all the jurisdictions in which we operate; and 

&#8226; the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business, for example by preventing us from marketing one or more of our product candidates for one or more indications. 

Any of the aforementioned threats to our competitive advantage could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Table of Contents 

We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents and trade secrets, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful. 

Third parties may seek to market biosimilar versions of any approved products. Alternatively, third parties may seek approval to market their own products similar to or otherwise competitive with our product candidates. In these circumstances, we may need to defend or assert our patents, including by filing lawsuits alleging patent infringement. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. In any of these types of proceedings, a court or agency with jurisdiction may find our patents invalid or unenforceable. Even if we have valid and enforceable patents, these patents still may not provide protection against competing products or processes sufficient to achieve our business objectives. 

Even after they have issued, our patents and any patents that we license may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented. If our patents are invalidated or otherwise limited or will expire prior to the commercialization of our product candidates, other companies may be better able to develop products that compete with ours, which could adversely affect our competitive business position, business prospects and financial condition. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates. 

The following are examples of litigation and other adversarial proceedings or disputes that we could become a party to involving our patents or patents licensed to us: 

&#8226; we or our strategic partners may initiate litigation or other proceedings against third parties to enforce our patent or trade secret rights; 

&#8226; third parties may initiate litigation or other proceedings seeking to invalidate patents owned by or licensed to us or to obtain a declaratory judgment that their product or technology does not infringe our patents or patents licensed to us; 

&#8226; third parties may initiate opposition or reexamination proceedings challenging the validity or scope of our patent rights, requiring us or our strategic partners and/or licensors to participate in such proceedings to defend the validity and scope of our patents; 

&#8226; there may be a challenge or dispute regarding inventorship or ownership of patents or trade secrets currently identified as being solely or co-owned by us or by a licensor who has granted a license to us; 

&#8226; the USPTO may initiate an interference between patents or patent applications owned by or licensed to us and those of our competitors, requiring us or our strategic partners and/or licensors to participate in an interference proceeding to determine the priority of invention, which could jeopardize our patent rights; or 

&#8226; third parties may seek approval to market biosimilar versions of our future approved products prior to expiration of relevant patents owned by or licensed to us, requiring us to defend our patents, including by filing lawsuits alleging patent infringement. 

These lawsuits and proceedings would be costly and could affect our results of operations and divert the attention of our managerial and scientific personnel. Adversaries in these proceedings may have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to prosecuting these legal actions than we or our licensors can. There is a risk that a court or administrative body would decide that our patents are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed or trade secrets not misappropriated by a third party&#8217;s activities, or that the scope of certain issued claims must be further limited. An adverse outcome in a litigation or proceeding involving our own patents or trade secrets could limit our ability to assert our patents or trade secrets against these or other competitors, affect our ability to receive royalties or other licensing consideration from our licensees, and may curtail or preclude our ability to exclude third parties from making, using and selling similar or competitive products. Any of these occurrences could adversely affect our competitive business position, business prospects and financial condition. 

We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors or licensees, infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. Any litigation or other proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights may fail, and even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. 

Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock.

The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. For example: 

&#8226; others may be able to develop a platform that is similar to, or better than, ours in a way that is not covered by the claims of our patents; 

&#8226; others may be able to make compounds that are similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of our patents; 

&#8226; we might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by patents or pending patent applications; 

&#8226; we might not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions; 

&#8226; any patents that we obtain may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may ultimately be found invalid or unenforceable; or 

&#8226; we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable or that afford meaningful trade secret protection. 

Patent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time. 

Patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. Various extensions may be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired, we may be open to competition from competitive products, including biosimilars. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. Further, judicial decisions in the United States raised questions regarding the award of patent term adjustment (&#8220;PTA&#8221;) for patents in families where related patents have issued without PTA. Thus, it cannot be said with certainty how PTA will be viewed in the future and whether patent expiration dates may be impacted. 

If we do not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and similar legislation in other countries for extending the term of patents covering each of our product candidates, our business may be materially harmed. 

Depending upon the timing, duration and conditions of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years for a patent covering an approved product as compensation for effective patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, we may not receive an extension if we fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we can enforce our patent rights for that product will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval to market competing products sooner. As a result, our revenue from applicable products could be reduced, possibly materially. Further, if this occurs, our competitors may take advantage of our investment in development and trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case. 

If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected. 

In addition to patent protection, we also rely on other proprietary rights, including protection of trade secrets, and other proprietary information. For example, we treat our confidential and proprietary computational technologies, including unpatented know-how and other proprietary information, as trade secrets. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, strategic partners and others upon the commencement of their relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual&#8217;s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. Our agreements with employees and our personnel policies also provide that any inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us shall be our exclusive property. However, we may not obtain these agreements in all circumstances, and individuals with whom we have these agreements may not comply with their terms. We cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party that has or may have had access to, or houses or hosts, our trade secrets or proprietary information or that has 

Table of Contents 

been involved in the development of intellectual property. Further, despite such agreements, such inventions or confidential information may become disclosed or assigned to third parties. Monitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures is difficult and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary technologies will be effective. In the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or proprietary information, these agreements, even if obtained, may not provide meaningful protection, particularly for our trade secrets or other confidential information. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use technology or know-how owned by third parties in their work for us, disputes may arise between us and those third parties as to the rights in such technology or know-how or in related inventions. To the extent that an individual who is not obligated to assign rights in intellectual property to us is rightfully an inventor of intellectual property, we may need to obtain an assignment or a license to that intellectual property from that individual, or a third party or from that individual&#8217;s assignee. Such assignment or license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 

We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems and cloud storage sources, but such security measures may be breached, including through cyber-hacking or cyberattacks, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. 

Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. The disclosure of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and may materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent such third party, or those to whom they communicate such technology or information, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, or if we otherwise lose protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, the value of this information may be greatly reduced and our business and competitive position could be harmed. Adequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary information. 

As is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, we employ individuals who were previously or concurrently employed at research institutions and/or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may be subject to claims that these employees, or we, have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers, or that patents and applications we have filed to protect inventions of these employees, even those related to one or more of our product candidates, are rightfully owned by their former or concurrent employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Such trade secrets or other proprietary information could be awarded to a third party, and we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to commercialize our technology or products. Such license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. 

Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, documentary, fee payment and other requirements imposed by regulations and governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for noncompliance with these requirements. 

Periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents or applications will be due to the USPTO and various foreign patent offices at various points over the lifetime of our patents or applications. We have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and we rely on our outside patent annuity service to pay these fees when due. Additionally, the USPTO and various foreign patent offices require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with rules applicable to the particular jurisdiction. However, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If such an event were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

We may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship of our patents and other intellectual property. 

Although we are not currently experiencing any claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents, we may in the future be subject to claims that former employees, strategic partners or other third parties have an interest in our patents or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. While it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be 

Table of Contents 

involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. For example, the assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing or the assignment agreements may be breached, or we may have inventorship disputes arise from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees. 

Patent protection and patent prosecution for some of our product candidates may be dependent on, and the ability to assert patents and defend them against claims of invalidity may be maintained by, third parties. 

There may be times when certain patents that relate to our product candidates or any approved products are controlled by our licensees or licensors. Although we may, under such arrangements, have rights to consult with our strategic partners on actions taken as well as back-up rights of prosecution and enforcement, we have in the past and may in the future relinquish rights to prosecute and maintain patents and patent applications within our portfolio as well as the ability to assert such patents against infringers. 

If any current or future licensee or licensor with rights to prosecute, assert or defend patents related to our product candidates fails to appropriately prosecute and maintain patent protection for patents covering any of our product candidates, or if patents covering any of our product candidates are asserted against infringers or defended against claims of invalidity or unenforceability in a manner that adversely affects such coverage, our ability to develop and commercialize any such product candidate may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products. 

Changes in patent laws or patent jurisprudence could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products. 

The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. Changes in either the patent laws or in the interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property. We cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or found to be enforceable in our patents, in our strategic partners&#8217; patents or in third-party patents. U.S. Supreme Court rulings have either narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this has created uncertainty with respect to the validity, scope and value of patents, once obtained. 

In September 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, also known as the America Invents Act (&#8220;AIA&#8221;), was signed into law. An important change introduced by the AIA is that, as of March 16, 2013, the United States transitioned to a &#8220;first-to-file&#8221; system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties disclosing or claiming the same invention. A third party that has filed, or files a patent application in the USPTO after March 16, 2013, but before us, could be awarded a patent covering a given invention, even if we had made the invention before it was made by the third party. This requires us to be cognizant of the time from invention to filing of a patent application. 

Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the U.S. federal courts, the USPTO or similar authorities in foreign jurisdictions, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that may weaken our and our licensors&#8217; ability to obtain new patents or to enforce existing patents we and our licensors or partners may obtain in the future. For example, the U.S. Supreme Court held in Amgen v. Sanofi (2023) that a functionally claimed genus was invalid for failing to comply with the enablement requirement of the Patent Act. As such, any of our patent rights with functional claims may be vulnerable to third party challenges seeking to invalidate these claims for lacking enablement or adequate support in the specification. 

We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world. 

Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries 

Table of Contents 

outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our current or future products, if any, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. U.S. Supreme Court cases have narrowed the scope of what is considered patentable subject matter, for example, in the areas of software and diagnostic methods involving the association between treatment outcome and biomarkers. This could impact our ability to patent certain aspects of our technology in the United States. 

Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in jurisdictions other than the United States. The legal systems of certain countries do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license. 

The requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain sufficient claim scope to protect our products in those jurisdictions. India, certain countries in Europe and developing countries, including China, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we and our licensors may have limited remedies if patents are infringed or if we or our licensors are compelled to grant a license to a third party, which could materially diminish the value of those patents. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we own or license. 

Geo-political actions in the United States and in foreign countries could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution or maintenance of our patent applications or those of any current or future licensors or licensees and the maintenance, enforcement or defense of our issued patents or those of any current or future licensors or licensees. Accordingly, our competitive position may be impaired, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected. 

As another example, the complexity and uncertainty of European patent laws have increased in recent years. In Europe, a new unitary patent system was introduced on June 1, 2023, which will significantly impact European patents, including those granted before the introduction of this system. Under the unitary patent system, European applications have the option, upon grant of a patent, of becoming a Unitary Patent which is subject to the jurisdiction of the Unitary Patent Court (the &#8220; UPC &#8221; ). As the UPC is a new court system, there is no precedent for the court, increasing the uncertainty of any litigation. Patents granted before the implementation of the UPC have the option of opting out of the jurisdiction of the UPC and remaining as national patents in the UPC countries. Patents that remain under the jurisdiction of the UPC are potentially vulnerable to a single UPC-based revocation challenge that, if successful, could invalidate the patent in all countries who are signatories to the UPC. We cannot predict with certainty the long-term effects of any potential changes. 

We use open source software in connection with our internal research and development programs, which could negatively affect our ability to develop products and subject us to litigation or other actions. 

We use open source software in connection with our internal research and development programs. The terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts or courts outside of the United States, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to use this software. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software, or claiming that software we developed using such open source software is a derivative work of open source software and demanding the release of portions of our source code, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our platform and offerings. 

If we were to combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to relea se the source code of our proprietary software to the public. If we inappropriately use open 

Table of Contents 

source software, or if the license terms for open source software that we use change, we may be required to re-engineer our platform, incur additional costs, discontinue the use of some or all of our platform or take other remedial actions. 

In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or assurance of title or controls on origin of the software. Many of the risks associated with usage of open source software, such as the lack of warranties or assurances of title, cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage and, if not addressed, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We will need to obtain FDA approval for any proposed product candidate names, and any failure or delay associated with such approval may adversely affect our business. 

Any proprietary name or trademark we intend to use for our product candidates will require approval from the FDA regardless of whether we have secured a formal trademark registration from the USPTO. The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed product candidate names, including an evaluation of the potential for confusion with other product names. The FDA may also object to a product name if it believes the name inappropriately implies certain medical claims or contributes to an overstatement of efficacy. If the FDA objects to any product candidate names we propose, we may be required to adopt an alternative name for our product candidates. If we adopt an alternative name, we would lose the benefit of any existing trademark applications for such product candidate and may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable product name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA. We may be unable to build a successful brand identity for a new trademark in a timely manner or at all, which would limit our ability to commercialize our product candidates. 

Risks Related to Additional Legal and Compliance Matters 

Our employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, insider trading, and noncompliance with our policies and procedures. 

We are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, to provide accurate information to the FDA, to comply with federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations, to report financial information or data accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the health care industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a Code of Conduct and Business Ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions. In addition, employees may become subject of allegations of gender discrimination and other misconduct that are not in compliance with our policies and procedures, which, regardless of the ultimate outcome, may result in adverse publicity that could materially harm our brand, reputation and business. 

If we or our contractors or agents market products in a manner that violates healthcare fraud and abuse laws, or if we violate government price reporting laws and transparency laws, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties. 

In addition to FDA restrictions on the marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state healthcare laws restrict certain business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. If our product candidates are approved and we begin commercialization, we will be subject to additional healthcare laws and regulations enforced by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. These state and federal healthcare laws, commonly referred to as &#8220;fraud and abuse&#8221; laws, have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry, and include anti-kickback, false claims, data privacy and security and transparency statutes and regulations. 

Federal false claims laws prohibit, among other things, any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false 

Table of Contents 

claim paid. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. Most states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and federal false claims laws, which may apply to items such as pharmaceutical products and services reimbursed by private insurers. Administrative, civil and criminal sanctions may be imposed under these federal and state laws. 

The federal civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 

HIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services. 

We may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business, including HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable information. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways. These state laws may not have the same effect and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

The PPACA also included the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires applicable manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made in the previous year to covered recipients, including physicians and teaching hospitals, including certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians or their immediate family members. Failure to comply with the required reporting requirements could subject applicable reporting entities such as manufacturers to substantial civil monetary penalties. 

Many states have similar healthcare statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Certain states require pharmaceutical companies to implement a comprehensive compliance program that includes a limit or outright ban on expenditures for, or payments to, individual medical or health professionals and/or require pharmaceutical companies to track and report gifts and other payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. 

If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the healthcare laws or regulations described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal, civil or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion of products from reimbursement under government programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products will be sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 

If we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be adversely affected. 

Our research and development involves, and may in the future involve, the use of potentially hazardous materials and chemicals. Our operations may produce hazardous waste products. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards mandated by local, state and federal laws and regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. If an accident occurs, we could be held liable for resulting damages, which could be substantial. We are also subject to numerous environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations and fire and building codes, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens, use and storage of flammable agents and the handling of biohazardous materials. Although we maintain workers&#8217; compensation insurance as prescribed by certain jurisdictions in which we operate to cover us for costs and expenses we may 

Table of Contents 

incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of these materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us. Additional federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our operations may be adopted in the future. We may incur substantial costs to comply with, and substantial fines or penalties if we violate, any of these laws or regulations. 

We may be subject to certain costs and inefficiencies as a result of our 2022 Redomicile Transactions. 

We became a Delaware corporation in October 2022 as a result of the Redomicile Transactions. Pursuant to the agreements governing the Redomicile Transactions, we agreed to use reasonable efforts to take certain corporate steps and actions, as may be necessary or desirable, to effect and implement certain post-arrangement transactions, including the internal reorganization of certain subsidiaries (the &#8220;Post-Arrangement Transactions&#8221;). Following the entry into the Original Jazz Collaboration Agreement subsequent to the Redomicile Transactions, we determined that completing the Post-Arrangement Transactions as originally contemplated would result in negative tax consequences. As a result, we do not currently intend to complete the Post-Arrangement Transactions. While we expect to manage any tax and operational inefficiencies that may result under our current organizational structure, and we may pursue additional internal reorganizations in the future, certain tax and operational inefficiencies may persist notwithstanding our management and/or additional reorganization that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations (including, for example, the requirement to recognize certain income (such as interest income) under the &#8220;global intangible low-taxed income&#8221; regime). 

We incurred a number of non-recurring costs associated with the Redomicile Transactions, and the associated reorganization of our corporate structure may result in additional and unforeseen expenses in the future. While it is expected that benefits of the Redomicile Transactions will offset these transaction costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the short-term or at all. These combined factors could adversely affect our business and overall financial condition. 

Risks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth 

Our future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. 

We are highly dependent on key members of our senior management team, including Kenneth Galbraith, the Chair of our board of directors, President, and Chief Executive Officer, Leone Patterson, our Chief Business Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Paul Moore, our Chief Scientific Officer, Jeffrey Smith, our Chief Medical Officer, and other key members of our senior management, scientific and clinical teams. Although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers, each of them may terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of the services of our key senior managers and employees could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. 

Retention and any future recruitment of qualified scientific, technical, clinical, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel will also be critical to our success. If we are successful in advancing the development of our early-stage candidates, we will need to evaluate any organizational hiring needs. In addition, we will need to effectively manage our managerial, operational, financial, development and other resources in order to successfully pursue our research, development and commercialization efforts for our existing and future product candidates. Furthermore, replacing key senior managers and employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited talent pool in our industry due to the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products. Intense competition for attracting key skill-sets and the impact of inflationary pressure on wages may limit our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel on acceptable terms. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, our ability to pursue our business strategy will be limited. 

As we advance our development and commercialization plans and strategies, we may need to grow or modify our organization, and we may experience difficulty in managing such change, which could disrupt our operations. 

As of December 31, 2024, we had 280 full-time employees. As we advance our development and commercialization plans and strategies in the future, we anticipate that we may need to expand or modify our employee base. As our product candidates enter and advance through preclinical studies and any clinical trials, we may need to expand or modify our development, manufacturing, regulatory sales and marketing capabilities or contract with other organizations to provide these capabilities for 

Table of Contents 

us. We believe the need for future expansion or modification in these areas will increase a s our product candidates reach later stages of preclinical and clinical development. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of their attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing any necessary growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage an expansion or modification of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational errors, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity amongst remaining employees. Any growth or organizational modification could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of existing and additional product candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage any needed growth or organizational modifications, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate or grow revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and compete effectively with others in our industry will depend on our ability to effectively manage any future growth or organizational modification. 

Risks Related to Our Common Stock 

Our stock price is likely to be volatile and the market price of our common stock may drop below the price paid by stockholders. 

Investors should consider an investment in our common stock as risky and invest only if they can withstand a significant loss and wide fluctuations in the market value of their investment. Investors may be unable to sell their common stock at or above the price they paid for such stock due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock arising from changes in our operating performance or prospects. Factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include: 

&#8226; results and timing of our clinical trials and clinical trials of our competitors&#8217; products; 

&#8226; failure or discontinuation of any of our development programs; 

&#8226; the success of our partnerships; 

&#8226; our ability to achieve milestones and receive associated milestone payments pursuant to the terms of our partnerships; 

&#8226; issues in manufacturing our product candidates or future approved products; 

&#8226; regulatory developments or enforcement in the United States and foreign countries with respect to our product candidates or our competitors&#8217; products; 

&#8226; competition from existing products or new products that may emerge; 

&#8226; developments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights; 

&#8226; introduction of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors; 

&#8226; announcements by us, our strategic partners or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments; 

&#8226; actions taken by industry or securities analysts that cover our company or common stock, including changes in estimates or recommendations, inaccurate or unfavorable research or a decision to drop coverage; 

&#8226; fluctuations in the valuation of companies in the biotechnology industry or otherwise perceived by investors to be comparable to us; 

&#8226; additional instances of stockholder activism, including unsolicited takeover proposals or proxy contests; 

&#8226; public concern over our product candidates or any future approved products; 

&#8226; litigation; 

&#8226; future sales of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur; 

&#8226; stock price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our common stock; 

&#8226; additions or departures of key personnel; 

&#8226; our ability to execute on our key strategic priorities; 

&#8226; changes in the structure of health care payment systems in the United States or other countries; 

&#8226; failure of zanidatamab or our product candidates, if approved, to achieve commercial success; 

Table of Contents 

&#8226; economic and other external factors or other disasters or crises, including pandemics; 

&#8226; period-to-period fluctuations in our financial condition and results of operations, including the timing of receipt of any milestone or other payments under commercialization or licensing agreements; 

&#8226; general market conditions and market conditions for biopharmaceutical stocks; 

&#8226; potential disagreements or disputes with certain of our stockholders; 

&#8226; our ability to effectively address environmental, social, and governance matters affecting our business that are a focus of certain investors, environmental activists, the media, and governmental and nongovernmental organizations; 

&#8226; overall fluctuations in U.S. equity markets; 

&#8226; purchases under our Repurchase Program; and 

&#8226; other factors that may be unanticipated or out of our control. 

The stock market in general, and the stock of biopharmaceutical companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the relevant companies, which has resulted in increased volatility and decreased stock prices for many companies notwithstanding the lack of a fundamental change in their underlying business models or prospects. Broad market and industry factors, including potentially worsening economic conditions and other adverse effects or developments, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following a decline in the market price of their securities. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management&#8217;s attention and resources, which could materially harm our business. The realization of any of the above risks or any of a broad range of other risks, including those described in this &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section, could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. 

An active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained. 

If an active market for our common stock does not continue, it may be difficult for our stockholders to sell their stock without depressing the market price for the common stock or sell their common stock at or above the prices at which they acquired their common stock or sell their common stock at the time they would like to sell. Any inactive trading market for our common stock may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund our operations by selling common stock and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our common stock as consideration. 

We may fail to meet the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (&#8220;Nasdaq&#8221;). If Nasdaq delists our shares of common stock from trading on its exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: 

&#8226; significant impairment of the liquidity for our common stock, which may substantially decrease the market price of our common stock; 

&#8226; a limited availability of market quotations for our securities; 

&#8226; a determination that our common stock qualifies as a &#8220;penny stock&#8221; which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our common stock; 

&#8226; a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and 

&#8226; a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. 

Our management team has broad discretion to use the net proceeds from our financing activities as well as funds received pursuant to our strategic collaborations, and its investment of these proceeds may not yield a favorable return. They may invest the proceeds in ways with which our stockholders disagree. 

Our management team has broad discretion in the applicatio n of the proceeds we receive from our financing activities and from our strategic collaborations, and we could spend or invest the proceeds in ways with which our stockholders disagree. Accordingly, stockholders will need to rely on our management team&#8217;s judgment with respect to the use of these proceeds. The failure by management to apply these funds effectively could negatively affect our ability to operate and grow our business. We cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds received from our fundraising efforts or for funds received pursuant to our strategic collaborations and our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors. Until the net proceeds are used, they may be placed in investments that do not produce significant income or that may lose value. 

Table of Contents 

We do not anticipate paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future, and accordingly, stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment. 

We have never paid any dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business and do not anticipate that we will declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain on investment in our common stock for the foreseeable future. Investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in our common stock. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, and, as a result, future dividends payable to investors are not guaranteed. 

Our principal stockholders, in aggregate, could exert substantial influence over us which could delay or prevent a change in corporate control or result in the entrenchment of management or the board of directors. 

Our principal stockholders, being our stockholders that beneficially own 5% or more of our common stock, together with their affiliates and related persons, in aggregate, beneficially owned approximately 53.9% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2024. Our directors and executive officers beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 2.3% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2024. Our principal stockholders, if acting together (with or without our directors and executive officers), may have the ability to exert substantial influence over the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and remova l of directors and any merger or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, our principal stockholders, if acting together (with or without our directors and executive officers), may have the ability to exert substantial influence over the management and affairs of our company. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership could harm the market price of our common stock by: 

&#8226; delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control; 

&#8226; entrenching our management or the board of directors; 

&#8226; impeding a merger, takeover, or other business combination involving us; or 

&#8226; discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. 

We qualify as a smaller reporting company, and any decision on our part to comply only with certain reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to such companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors. 

We qualify as a &#8220;smaller reporting company,&#8221; as defined under the Exchange Act, and, for as long as we continue to be a smaller reporting company, we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies. 

In addition, we are a &#8220;non-accelerated filer&#8221; as defined under the Exchange Act. For as long as we continue to be a non-accelerated filer, we are eligible to take advantage of an exemption from the requirement that our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404. For this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2024, we are relying on this exemption and have not obtained an attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm. Our decision to rely on this exemption may have a detrimental impact on our ability to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, and any failure to maintain adequacy, or inability to produce accurate financial statements or other reports on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and could materially impair our ability to operate our business. As a result of our decision to rely on certain of these disclosure exemptions, the information we provide stockholders will be different than the information that is available with respect to other public companies and some investors may find our shares of common stock less attractive, which may result in a less active trading market for our common stock. 

If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock. 

Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and adequate disclosure controls and procedures. Effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Even if our management concludes that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, our independent registered public accounting firm may conclude that there are material weaknesses with respect to our internal controls or the 

Table of Contents 

level at which our internal controls are documented, designed, implemented or reviewed. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal controls could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation. 

We plan to transition to a new enterprise resource planning system in 2025, which we believe will lead to improvements in our internal control over financial reporting; however, the full impact of this transition is not yet known. If, during the evaluation and testing process of our internal controls, we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting in the future. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets. Furthermore, if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, including as a result of remote working by our employees, our business and results of operations would likely be materially and adversely affected. 

Holders of our Exchangeable Shares are subject to additional risks. 

Pursuant to the Redomicile Transactions, certain holders of common shares of our predecessor company exchanged their common shares for exchangeable shares (&#8220;Exchangeable Shares&#8221;) in the capital of our subsidiary Zymeworks ExchangeCo Ltd. (&#8220;ExchangeCo&#8221;). Exchangeable Shares are exchangeable at the option of the holder for shares of our common stock. 

Exchangeable Shares are subject to additional risks, including: 

&#8226; The Exchangeable Shares are not and will not be listed on any stock exchange. There is no market through which the Exchangeable Shares may be sold, and holders may not be able to sell their Exchangeable Shares. 

&#8226; Holders of Exchangeable Shares who request an exchange may not receive shares of our common stock until a period of time after the applicable request is received. During this period, the market price of our common stock may increase or decrease. Any such increase or decrease would affect the value of the consideration to be received by such a holder of Exchangeable Shares upon a subsequent sale of shares of our common stock received in the exchange. 

&#8226; Exchangeable Shares may be subject to different tax consequences under Canadian law depending on whether the exchangeable shares are disposed of in a redemption or an acquisition by one of our subsidiaries, and such transaction may not be within the control of the holder. 

&#8226; The tax treatment of Exchangeable Shares for non-Canadian tax purposes, including U.S. federal income tax purposes, is uncertain. 

Delaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws might delay, discourage or prevent a change in control of Zymeworks or changes in our management, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. 

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of Zymeworks more difficult or delay or prevent changes in control of its management. Among other things, these provisions: 

&#8226; authorize our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval; 

&#8226; permit only the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill vacancies and newly created directorships on the board, provided that the board of directors&#8217; ability to increase the size of the board and fill vacancies and newly created directorships will be subject to the restrictions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws; 

&#8226; establish that members of our board of directors serve in one of three staggered terms of three years each; 

&#8226; provide that our directors may only be removed by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of the shares cast on such proposal; 

&#8226; permit stockholders to only take actions at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent; 

Table of Contents 

&#8226; require that stockholders give advance notice to nominate directors or submit proposals for consideration at stockholder meetings; 

&#8226; not provide for cumulative voting rights in the election of directors; 

&#8226; provide that special meetings of Zymeworks&#8217; stockholders may be called only by the board of directors, the chairperson of the board of directors, Zymeworks&#8217; chief executive officer, president or the secretary upon request from holders of no less than 20% of our outstanding voting stock, subject to the limitations and requirements set forth in our amended and restated bylaws; and 

&#8226; require a super-majority vote of stockholders to amend some of the provisions described above. 

In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any &#8220;interested stockholder&#8221; for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an &#8220;interested stockholder&#8221; unless certain conditions are met. 

These provisions, alone or together, could delay, discourage or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of Zymeworks. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause Zymeworks to take other corporate actions they desire, any of which, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. 

Our amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between Zymeworks and its stockholders, and also provide that the federal district courts are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act, each of which could limit our stockholders&#8217; ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with Zymeworks or its directors, officers, stockholders or employees. 

Our amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, stockholders, officers or other employees to Zymeworks or our stockholders, (3) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or (4) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another State court in Delaware or the federal district court for the District of Delaware), except for any claim as to which such court determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of such court (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of such court within ten days following such determination), which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than such court or for which such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction. This provision does not apply to any action brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. 

Section 22 of the Securities Act establishes concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over Securities Act claims. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to hear such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States will be the sole and exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. 

Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding or owning (or continuing to hold or own) any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing bylaw provisions. Although we believe these exclusive forum provisions benefit us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law and federal securities laws in the types of lawsuits to which each applies, the exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder&#8217;s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our current or former directors, officers, stockholders or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our current and former directors, officers, stockholders and other employees. Our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder as a result of our exclusive forum provisions. 

The enforceability of similar exclusive forum provisions in other companies&#8217; organizational documents have been challenged in legal proceedings, and, while certain courts have determined these provisions are enforceable, it is possible that a court of law 

Table of Contents 

could rule that these types of provisions are inapplicable or unenforceable if they are challenged in a proceeding or otherwise. If a court were to find either exclusive forum provision contained in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our financial condition and results of operations. 

There can be no assurance that we will repurchase additional shares of our common stock or that we will repurchase shares at favorable prices. 

In August 2024, our board of directors approved the Repurchase Program, pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase up to $60.0 million of our common stock from time to time through open market transactions, or other means in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. As of December 31, 2024, we have repurchased 2,545,402 shares of our common stock under the Repurchase Program. The timing, number of shares repurchased, and prices paid for any additional shares of stock repurchased under this program will depend on general business and market conditions as well as corporate and regulatory limitations, prevailing stock prices, and other considerations. Our Repurchase Program may be suspended or discontinued at any time, and does not obligate us to acquire any additional shares of common stock. 

Our ability to make share repurchases will depend upon market conditions, cash balances and future capital requirements, results of operations, financial condition, compliance with applicable legal requirements and other factors that we may deem relevant and which may be beyond our control. In addition, we can provide no assurance that we will repurchase stock at favorable prices. As a result, there can be no guarantee around the timing of our share repurchases. Any failure to repurchase additional shares of stock, a reduction in the frequency of repurchases, or the completion of our Repurchase Program could have a negative effect on our reputation, investor confidence in us and our stock price. 

The existence of our Repurchase Program could cause our stock price to be higher than it otherwise would be and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Although our Repurchase Program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance that it will do so because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchase shares, and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the effectiveness of the program. 

Repurchasing our common stock reduces the amount of cash we have available, and we may fail to realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of any share repurchase program.

You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in our other public filings. The occurrence of any of these risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or growth prospects or cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements we have made in this report and those we may make from time to time. You should consider all of the risk factors described in our public filings when evaluating our business. 

Risks Related to the Discovery, Development and Regulation of Our Product Candidates 

If we fail to complete the preclinical or clinical development of, or to obtain regulatory approval for, our product candidates, our business would be significantly harmed. 

All of our product candidates are currently in research or early clinical development. We have not completed clinical development of or obtained regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. Only a small percentage of research and development programs ultimately result in commercially successful products, and we cannot assure you that any of our product candidates will demonstrate the safety, purity and potency, or efficacy profiles necessary to support further preclinical study, clinical development or regulatory approval. In addition, we have historically focused on the development of cell therapies for cancer. We have limited prior experience in developing treatments for autoimmune diseases, and there are no cell therapies approved in the United States to treat autoimmune diseases. 

We may experience delays in, or cancel our ongoing and planned clinical development activities or research and development activities for any of our product candidates for a variety of reasons, including: 

&#8226; difficulties in optimizing the right dose and dosing schedule for our product candidates, which might result in a determination that a product candidate is ineffective, causes harmful side effects, or otherwise presents unacceptable safety risks during clinical trials or has an unfavorable toxicity profile in preclinical studies or early clinical trials to support initiating or continuing clinical investigation; 

&#8226; difficulties in manufacturing or distributing a product candidate, including the inability to manufacture and distribute a product candidate in a sufficient quantity, suitable form, or in a cost-effective manner, or under protocols and processes and with materials and facilities acceptable to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for the conduct of clinical trials or for marketing approval; 

&#8226; our prioritization of certain of our product candidates for advancement or the emergence of competing product candidates developed by others, including a decision to cease research and development of any existing product candidate due to the potential obsolescence of our product candidate by a competing product or product candidate or our determination that another of our existing or future product candidates has greater potential for clinical development, regulatory approval, or commercialization, including potentially greater therapeutic benefit, a more favorable safety or efficacy profile, a more consistent or more cost effective manufacturing process, or a more favorable commercial profile, including greater market acceptance or commercial potential, or more advantageous intellectual property position; 

&#8226; challenges and delays in trial execution which may result from our testing of multiple product candidates in the same indication in different clinical trials, as well as competition from biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, universities, and other research institutions for patients, qualified investigators and clinical trial sites; 

&#8226; the proprietary rights of third parties, which may preclude us from developing, manufacturing or commercializing a product candidate; 

&#8226; determining that a product candidate may be uneconomical to develop, manufacture, or commercialize, or may fail to achieve market acceptance or an adequate pricing and reimbursement profile; 

&#8226; our inability to secure or maintain relationships with strategic partners that may be necessary for advancement of a product candidate into or through clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization in any particular indication(s) or geographic territory(ies); and 

&#8226; difficulty establishing predictive preclinical models for demonstration of safety and efficacy of a product candidate in one or more potential therapeutic areas for clinical development. 

For example, in January 2023, we announced the discontinuation of our FT516, FT596, FT538, and FT536 NK cell programs to focus our resources on advancing our most innovative and differentiated programs. We also announced the termination of the Collaboration and Option Agreement we entered into with Janssen Biotech, Inc. (Janssen) on April 20, 2020 (the Janssen Agreement), 

&#160; 

&#160; 

which termination took effect on April 3, 2023. As a result of the termination, we discontinued the development of two product candidates that had been expected to enter the clinic in 2023. 

Additionally, we will only be able to obtain regulatory approval to market a product candidate if we can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, in well-designed and conducted clinical trials that such product candidate is manufactured in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, is safe, pure and potent, or effective, and otherwise meets the appropriate standards required for approval for a particular indication. Our ability to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates depends on, among other things, completion of additional preclinical studies, process development and manufacturing activities, and clinical trials, whether our clinical trials demonstrate statistically significant efficacy with safety profiles that do not potentially outweigh the therapeutic benefit, and whether regulatory agencies agree that the data from our clinical trials and our manufacturing operations are sufficient to support approval. In addition, the approval by the FDA of new products in the same indications that we are studying may change the standard of care, and this may result in the FDA or other regulatory agencies requesting that we conduct additional studies to show that our product candidate is superior to the new standard of care. Securing regulatory approval also requires the submission of information about product manufacturing operations to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the relevant regulatory authority. The results of our current and future clinical trials may not meet the FDA&#8217;s or other regulatory agencies&#8217; requirements to approve a product candidate for marketing, and the regulatory agencies may otherwise determine that our manufacturing operations are insufficient to support approval. We may need to conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials that we currently do not anticipate, including as a result of changes in the standard of care. If we fail to complete preclinical or clinical development of, or obtain regulatory approval for, our product candidates, we will not be able to generate any revenues from product sales and our ability to receive milestone or other payments under any collaboration agreements may be impaired, which will harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. 

We may face delays in initiating, conducting or completing our clinical trials, and we may not be able to initiate, conduct or complete them at all. 

We are heavily dependent on our ability to complete the clinical development of, and obtain regulatory approval for, our product candidates. We have not completed the clinical trials necessary to support an application for approval to market any of our product candidates. We, or any investigators who initiate or conduct clinical trials of our product candidates, may experience delays in our current or future clinical trials, and we do not know whether we or our investigators will be able to initiate, enroll patients in, or complete, clinical trials of our product candidates on time, if at all. Current and future clinical trials of our product candidates may be delayed, unsuccessful or terminated, or not initiated at all, as a result of many factors, including factors related to: 

&#8226; difficulties in identifying eligible patients for participation in clinical trials of our product candidates; 

&#8226; difficulties enrolling a sufficient number of suitable patients to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates, including difficulties resulting from patients enrolling in studies of therapeutic product candidates sponsored by us or our competitors and difficulties resulting from patient availability as a result of any measures taken by governmental authorities, hospitals, or clinical trial sites in response to any future public health crises or other serious disasters or similar events; 

&#8226; difficulties determining suitable doses and schedules of our novel cell product candidates for evaluation in clinical trials; 

&#8226; difficulties in obtaining agreement from regulatory authorities on study endpoints and/or study duration, achieving study endpoints, the amount and sufficiency of data demonstrating efficacy and safety, and completing data analysis in clinical trials for any of our product candidates; 

&#8226; delays in filing an Investigational New Drug (IND) application or IND amendment with the FDA to initiate or amend clinical trials of our current product candidates and any other product candidates that we may identify; 

&#8226; difficulties in obtaining agreement with regulatory authorities on the preclinical safety and efficacy data, the manufacturing requirements, and the clinical trial design and parameters necessary for an IND application to go into effect to initiate and conduct clinical trials for any of our current product candidates and any other product candidates that we may develop; 

&#8226; the occurrence of unexpected safety issues or adverse events in any ongoing or future clinical trials of our product candidates, including in trials of our product candidates conducted by investigator-sponsors; 

&#8226; securing and maintaining the support of clinical investigators and investigational sites, including investigators and sites who may conduct clinical trials under an investigator-sponsored IND with our financial support, and obtaining institutional review board (IRB) approval at each site for the conduct of our clinical trials; 

&#8226; reaching agreement on acceptable terms with third-party service providers and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different service providers and clinical trial sites; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; failure to manufacture certain of our product candidates consistently, and at acceptable quality levels and costs, in accordance with our protocol-specified manufacturing requirements and applicable regulatory requirements; 

&#8226; failure or delays in obtaining sufficient quantities of suitable raw materials, components, and equipment necessary for the conduct of our clinical trials or the manufacture of any product candidate, including any inability to obtain materials as a result of supply chain issues related to any future public health crises or other serious disasters or ongoing or emerging global geopolitical tensions, including wars and other armed conflicts, or other factors; 

&#8226; failure or delays by us or by our clinical sites to obtain sufficient quantities of components and supplies necessary for the conduct of our clinical trials, including any inability to obtain agents such as cyclophosphamide or fludarabine which may be required to condition patients for treatment with our product candidates, or certain monoclonal antibodies which are intended for administration to patients in combination with many of our product candidates in certain of our clinical trials; 

&#8226; challenges in distributing our product candidates to clinical trial sites, or failure to establish effective protocols for the supply and transport of our product candidates; 

&#8226; the costs of conducting clinical trials or manufacturing of our product candidates being greater than we anticipate, including due to rising inflation rates, or the timelines for these activities being longer than we anticipate; 

&#8226; our failure, or the failure of investigators, third-party service providers, or clinical trial sites, to ensure the proper and timely conduct of and analysis of data from clinical trials of our product candidates; 

&#8226; inability to reach agreement on clinical trial design and parameters with regulatory authorities, investigators, and IRBs; 

&#8226; imposition of a temporary or permanent clinical hold by data monitoring committees or regulatory agencies for a number of reasons, including after review of an IND submission or amendment, a new safety finding that presents unreasonable risk to clinical trial participants, a negative finding from an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites, developments in trials conducted by us or our competitors that raise concerns about the safety risk to patients of novel therapeutics derived from pluripotent or genome edited therapies and/or negative public perception of the same, or if the FDA finds that the investigational protocol or plan is clearly deficient to meet its stated objectives; 

&#8226; the serious, life-threatening diseases of the patients in our oncology clinical trials, who may die or suffer adverse medical events during the course of the trials for reasons that may not be related to our product candidates; 

&#8226; failure of patients to complete clinical trials or adhere to study protocols due to safety issues, side effects, disruptions in study conduct, or other reasons; 

&#8226; approval of competitive agents or changes in the standard of care or treatment landscape on which a clinical development plan was based, which may require new or additional trials, or render our product candidates or clinical trial designs obsolete; 

&#8226; clinical trials of our product candidates producing negative or inconclusive results, which may result in our deciding, or regulators requiring us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs; 

&#8226; governmental or regulatory delays, including any delays due to limitations on the availability of governmental and regulatory agency personnel to review regulatory filings, conduct site inspections or engage in discussions with us as a result of the change in administration following the 2024 U.S. presidential election, any future public health crisis or other serious disaster or similar events, failure to obtain regulatory approval, or uncertainty or changes in U.S. or foreign regulatory requirements, policy or guidelines; and 

&#8226; limitations on clinical trial conduct at our clinical trial sites resulting from prioritization of hospital and other medical resources toward other efforts, such as any future public health crisis or other serious disaster or similar events, policies and procedures implemented at clinical sites with respect to the conduct of clinical trials including those relating to site initiation, study monitoring, and data collection and analysis, and other precautionary measures taken in treating patients or in practicing medicine in response to various public health concerns. 

If there are delays in initiating or conducting any clinical trials of our product candidates or any of these clinical trials are terminated before completion, the commercial prospects of our product candidates will be harmed. In addition, any delays in initiating, conducting or completing our clinical trials or adjustments to certain of our study protocols and procedures, including as a result of any shortage of materials or agents necessary to conduct our studies or as a result of any future public health crisis or other public health concerns or other factors, will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and regulatory approval process, and jeopardize our ability to gain regulatory approval, commence product sales and generate revenues. Furthermore, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the initiation, conduct or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial 

&#160; 

&#160; 

of regulatory approval of our product candidates. Any of these occurrences would significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and market price of shares of our common stock. 

The manufacture and distribution of our cell product candidates, particularly our induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cell product candidates, is complex and subject to a multitude of risks. These risks could substantially increase our costs and limit the clinical and commercial supply of our product candidates, and the development and commercialization of our product candidates could be substantially delayed or restricted if the FDA or other regulatory authorities impose additional requirements on our manufacturing operations or if we are required to change our manufacturing operations to comply with regulatory requirements. 

The manufacture and supply of our cell product candidates involves novel processes that are more complex than those required for most small molecule drugs and other cellular immunotherapies, and accordingly present significant challenges and are subject to multiple risks. For our iPSC-derived product candidates, these complex processes include reprogramming human fibroblasts to obtain iPSCs, in some cases genetically engineering these iPSCs, and differentiating the iPSCs to obtain the desired cell product candidate. As a result of the complexities in manufacturing biologics and distributing cell therapies, the cost to manufacture and distribute biologics and cell therapies in general, and our cell product candidates in particular, is generally higher than for traditional small molecule chemical compounds. In addition, our cost of goods development is at an early stage. The actual cost to manufacture and process our product candidates could be greater than we expect and could materially and adversely affect the commercial viability of our product candidates. 

We have limited experience in the manufacture of cell-based therapies. We are still developing optimized and reproducible manufacturing processes for clinical and commercial-scale manufacturing of our product candidates, and none of our manufacturing processes have been validated for commercial production of our product candidates. We may face multiple challenges as we scale our manufacturing for large-scale clinical trials or commercial-scale including, among others, cost overruns, potential problems with process scale-up, process reproducibility, stability issues, compliance with good manufacturing practices, lot consistency and timely availability of raw materials. In addition, we are continuing to optimize our protocols for the supply and transport of our product candidates for distribution to clinical trial sites. Although we are working to develop reproducible and commercially viable manufacturing processes for our product candidates, and effective protocols for the supply and transport of our product candidates, doing so is a difficult and uncertain task. 

We may make changes or be required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities to make changes to our manufacturing processes, including materials and equipment used in manufacturing our product candidates, as we continue to develop and refine the manufacturing and distribution processes for our product candidates for advanced clinical trials and commercialization, and we cannot be sure that even minor changes in these processes, materials, and equipment will not cause our product candidates to perform differently and affect the results of our ongoing and planned clinical trials or the performance of the product once commercialized. In some circumstances, changes in our manufacturing operations, including to our protocols, processes, materials or facilities used, may require us to perform additional preclinical or comparability studies, or to collect additional clinical data from patients prior to undertaking additional clinical studies or filing for regulatory approval for a product candidate. These requirements may lead to delays in our clinical development and commercialization plans for our product candidates, and may increase our development costs substantially. 

The manufacturing processes for any products that we may develop are subject to FDA and foreign regulatory authority approval requirements, and we and any contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) or other third-party manufacturers that we may engage for manufacturing our product candidates will need to meet all applicable FDA and foreign regulatory authority requirements on an ongoing basis. Our existing product candidates are currently manufactured by us and our current manufacturing operations, including protocols, processes, materials, and facilities, may not support regulatory approval of our existing product candidates. We may be required to identify alternative protocols, processes, materials or facilities for the manufacture of any of these product candidates in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. In addition, we may be required to make changes to our protocols for the supply and transport of our product candidates to enable effective distribution of our product candidates. Any modifications to our manufacturing and supply protocols, processes, materials or facilities, and any delays in, or inability to, establish acceptable manufacturing and supply operations for our product candidates could require us to incur additional development costs or result in delays to our clinical development. If we or any CMOs or other third-party manufacturers that we may engage for manufacturing our product candidates are unable to reliably produce products to specifications acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory authorities, we may not obtain or maintain the regulatory approvals we need to commercialize such products. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, there is no assurance that either we or any CMOs or other third-party manufacturers that we may engage for manufacturing our product candidates will be able to manufacture the approved product to specifications acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory authorities, to produce it in sufficient quantities and on the requisite timelines to meet the requirements for the potential launch of the product, or to meet potential future demand. Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements may require us or any third-party manufacturers that we may engage for manufacturing our product candidates to perform additional studies or to modify protocols, processes, materials or facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or any components thereof. Any of these challenges could delay initiation or completion of clinical trials, require bridging clinical trials or the repetition of one or more 

&#160; 

&#160; 

clinical trials, increase clinical trial costs, delay approval of our product candidates, impair commercialization efforts, increase our cost of goods, and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 

A disruption to our manufacturing operations, or the inability by us or our third-party suppliers or manufacturers to manufacture sufficient quantities of our product candidates at acceptable quality levels or costs, or at all, would materially and adversely affect our business. 

Developing manufacturing processes to support clinical studies and commercialization requirements is a difficult and uncertain task, and there are risks associated with scaling to the level required for clinical trials or commercialization, including, among others, cost overruns, potential problems with process scale-out, process reproducibility, stability and purity issues, lot consistency, and timely availability of acceptable reagents and raw materials. If we are unable to scale to the level required for the conduct of clinical trials or commercialization, we may not be able to produce our product candidates in a sufficient quantity to conduct our ongoing and planned clinical trials, or to meet demand if any product candidates are approved for commercialization. We have not yet caused any of our product candidates to be manufactured or processed on a commercial scale and may not be able to do so for any of our product candidates. 

We are substantially dependent on our own internal manufacturing facilities in San Diego, California for the production of our product candidates, and we rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of certain components to manufacture our product candidates for use in conducting clinical trials. The facilities used to manufacture our product candidates, including our own facilities, must be evaluated by the FDA or other foreign regulatory agencies pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit an application to the FDA or other foreign regulatory agencies. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority finds deficiencies with or does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it later finds deficiencies or withdraws any such approval in the future, we may not be able to locate additional or replacement facilities to produce such product candidates or materials in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. This would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved. 

Because we rely on our own manufacturing facilities to produce our product candidates and on third parties for the manufacture of certain components, we are required to transfer certain manufacturing process know-how and certain intermediates to third parties, including larger-scale facilities operated by a CMO or by us, to facilitate manufacture of our product candidates for clinical trials and commercialization. Transferring manufacturing testing and processes and know-how is complex and involves review and incorporation of both documented and undocumented processes that may have evolved over time. In addition, transferring production to different facilities may require utilization of new or different processes to meet the specific requirements of a given facility. We and any CMOs or third parties that we engage to manufacture our product candidates will need to conduct significant development work to transfer these processes and manufacture each of our product candidates for clinical trials and commercialization. In addition, we may be required to demonstrate the comparability of material generated by any CMO or third parties that we engage for manufacturing our product candidates with material previously produced and used in testing. Any inability to manufacture comparable drug product by us or any CMOs or third parties that we engage to manufacture our product candidates could delay the continued development of our product candidates. 

In addition to relying on third parties for the manufacture of certain components for the manufacture of our product candidates, we manufacture our product candidates ourselves, and intend to manufacture some or all of the clinical supply of our iPSC-derived NK-cell and T-cell product candidates for our ongoing and planned clinical trials. To do so, we will need to scale up our own manufacturing operations, as we do not currently have the infrastructure or capability internally to manufacture sufficient quantities of each of our product candidates to support the conduct of each of our clinical trials or commercialization of each of our product candidates, if approved. Accordingly, we will be required to make significant investments to maintain and expand our existing Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) manufacturing capabilities and facilities, establish additional GMP manufacturing facilities, conduct GMP production, and process and scale up development and technology transfer activities for the manufacture of our product candidates, and our efforts to scale our own manufacturing operations may not succeed. 

Even if we are successful in developing manufacturing capabilities sufficient for clinical and commercial supply, problems with our manufacturing operations or those of the third-party manufacturers upon which we rely, including difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, stability of the product, quality assurance testing, operator error, shortages of qualified personnel, shortages of materials and supplies, facility shutdowns, global pandemics or other public health concerns, global geopolitical tensions, including wars and other armed conflicts, natural disasters (including due to the effects of climate change) or other reasons, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations, could result in product defects or manufacturing failures that result in lot failures, product recalls, product liability claims or insufficient supplies of our product candidates for our ongoing and planned clinical trials or eventual commercialization. Further, delays in regulatory inspections, commissioning and receiving regulatory approvals for our manufacturing capabilities or facilities, including any new facilities could delay our development plans, 

&#160; 

&#160; 

including the initiation and conduct of our ongoing and planned clinical trials. In addition, we and our third-party manufacturers may have limited manufacturing capacity for certain product candidates or components used in manufacturing our product candidates, and we may fail to locate suitable additional or replacement manufacturing capacity, including for the manufacture of our product candidates in compliance with current GMP (cGMP) or current Good Tissue Practice (cGTP), on a reasonable basis or at all. Any such failure could be the basis for the FDA or other regulatory authorities to issue a warning letter, withdraw approvals for product candidates previously granted to us, or take other regulatory or legal action, including recall or seizure of outside supplies of the product candidate, total or partial suspension of production, suspension of ongoing clinical trials, refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, detention of product, refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunction or imposing civil and criminal penalties. 

Furthermore, certain of the components currently used in manufacturing our product candidates are research-grade only, and we may encounter problems obtaining or achieving adequate quantities and quality of clinical grade materials that meet FDA, European Medicines Agency, or other standards or specifications applicable in the United States or in other countries with consistent and acceptable production yields and costs. In addition, if contaminants are discovered in our supply of product candidates or in our manufacturing facilities or those of our third-party suppliers and manufacturers, such manufacturing facilities may be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination. Any such events could delay or prevent our ability to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. 

Because our approach to the development of product candidates is based on novel and unproven technologies, it is subject to a substantial degree of technological uncertainty and we may not succeed in developing any of our product candidates. 

All of our current product candidates are based on our novel iPSC platform, and some of our product candidates utilize novel genome editing technologies. To date, no iPSC-derived therapeutic product candidates have been approved in the United States or worldwide, and there have been only a limited number of regulatory approvals of genome edited therapeutics, and similarly a limited number of clinical trials involving the use of a therapeutic product candidate manufactured using a master iPSC line or genome edited cells. The development of such complex cell therapies is a relatively new and emerging field, and the scientific research that forms the basis of our efforts to discover and develop iPSC-derived and genome edited cellular immunotherapies is ongoing; this is particularly true in relation to the development of cell therapies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases where there is limited clinical data available and where we have limited prior experience. We may determine to incorporate information learned from this research into the design of our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials of our iPSC product candidates, as well as our planned future clinical trials, which could delay or impair our clinical development activities. We may ultimately discover that our product candidates do not possess certain properties required for therapeutic effectiveness or protection from toxicity in our target patient populations, or they may exhibit undesirable side effects as more patient data become available. In addition, our product candidates may demonstrate different chemical and pharmacological properties in patients than they do in laboratory studies. It may take many years before we develop a full understanding of the pharmacological properties of our product candidates, and we may never know precisely how they function in vivo. As with any new biologic or product developed using novel technologies, our product candidates have an unknown immunogenicity profile. As a result, our cellular immunotherapy product candidates may trigger immune responses that inhibit their therapeutic effects or cause adverse side effects. In addition, one or more of our product candidates may: 

&#8226; be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects during preclinical studies or clinical trials; 

&#8226; fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all; 

&#8226; be precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of third parties; 

&#8226; be difficult to manufacture on a large scale; or 

&#8226; be uneconomical to commercialize or fail to achieve market acceptance. 

Any such problems that affect one of our product candidates may have an unfavorable impact on all of our product candidates. As a result, we may never succeed in developing a marketable product and we may never become profitable, which would have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and market price of shares of our common stock. 

We anticipate that our current product candidates and any future product candidates may be used in combination with third-party drugs or biologics, some of which may still be in development, and we have limited or no control over the supply, regulatory status, or regulatory approval of such drugs or biologics. 

Certain of our product candidates are being developed for use in combination with one or more other cancer therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies, and other current or future product candidates may be used in combination with other biologics or drugs, both 

&#160; 

&#160; 

approved and unapproved, such as fludarabine. Our ability to develop and ultimately commercialize our current product candidates and any future product candidates used in combination with another drug or biologic will depend on our ability, or the ability of third-party clinical trial sites on which we rely, to access such drugs or biologics on commercially reasonable terms for the clinical trials and their availability for use with the commercialized product, if approved. We cannot be certain that we, or third-party clinical trial sites on which we rely, will be able to secure a steady supply of such drugs or biologics on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 

Any failure by us, or by third-party clinical trial sites on which we rely, to secure a steady supply of such drugs or biologics may delay our development timelines, increase our costs and jeopardize our ability to develop our current product candidates and any future product candidates as commercially viable therapies. If any of these occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects may be materially harmed. 

Moreover, the development of product candidates for use in combination with another product or product candidate may present challenges that are not faced for single agent product candidates. For example, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to use more complex clinical trial designs in order to evaluate the contribution of each product and product candidate to any observed effects. It is possible that the results of such trials could show that any positive previous trial results are attributable to the combination therapy and not our current product candidates or any of our future product candidates. Moreover, following product approval, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require that products used in conjunction with each other be cross labeled for combined use. To the extent that we do not have rights to the other product, this may require us to work with a third party to satisfy such a requirement. Moreover, developments related to the other product may impact our clinical trials for the combination as well as our commercial prospects should we receive marketing approval. Such developments may include changes to the other product&#8217;s safety or efficacy profile, changes to the availability of the approved product, quality, manufacturing and supply issues, and changes to the standard of care. 

In the event that any collaborator or supplier cannot continue to supply their products on commercially reasonable terms, we would need to identify alternatives for accessing such products. Additionally, should the supply of products from any collaborator or supplier be interrupted, delayed or otherwise be unavailable, our clinical trials may be delayed. In the event we are unable to source an alternative supply or are unable to do so on commercially reasonable terms, our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects may be materially harmed. 

In addition, to the extent a third-party clinical trial site on which we rely sources a combination therapy itself and does not submit the costs of such therapy to government programs or patients&#8217; insurance, the costs of such therapy may be passed on to us, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price and prospects. 

If we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials, including as a result of challenges in identifying and recruiting eligible patients to participate in our trials or competition for patients, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected. 

We are required to identify and enroll a sufficient number of patients with the disease under investigation for each of our ongoing and planned clinical trials of our product candidates, and we may not be able to identify and enroll a sufficient number of patients, or those with required or desired characteristics and who meet certain criteria, in a timely manner. In addition, we will be competing with other clinical trials of product candidates being developed by our competitors in the same therapeutic areas, and potential patients who might be eligible for enrollment in one of our clinical trials may instead choose to enroll in a trial being conducted by one of our competitors. We may also face an unwillingness of sites to participate in our clinical trials. A number of cell therapy companies have recently commenced clinical trials for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, which has increased competition for investigators and for patients for our ongoing and any future clinical trials that we may initiate for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. 

Our ability, and the ability of investigators, to enroll patients in our ongoing and planned clinical trials of our product candidates is affected by factors including: 

&#8226; our ability to identify clinical trial sites and recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate capabilities, competencies and experience; 

&#8226; our ability to open clinical trial sites; 

&#8226; the ability to identify, solicit and recruit a sufficient number of patients; 

&#8226; severity of the disease under investigation; 

&#8226; the design of the clinical trial and whether the FDA agrees to the design and implementation of the trial; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; the relatively small size and nature of the patient populations for certain of our clinical trials; 

&#8226; eligibility criteria for the clinical trials in question; 

&#8226; clinicians&#8217; and patients&#8217; perceptions as to the potential risks and benefits of the product candidate under study, including any perceived risks associated with our iPSC-derived product candidates, which we believe are the first ever iPSC-derived cell therapies cleared by the FDA for clinical investigation in the United States, or with our chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies broadly following FDA&#8217;s investigation into reports of T-cell malignancies for B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)- and CD19-directed autologous CAR T cell therapies, and perceived risks associated with the novel use of cell therapies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, where there are no FDA-approved cell therapies and limited clinical precedent; 

&#8226; changing medical practice patterns or guidelines related to the indications we are investigating; 

&#8226; the availability of competing therapies and clinical trials; 

&#8226; efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials; 

&#8226; the availability of time and resources at the limited number of institutions at which our clinical trials are or will be conducted, including any constraints on resources, or policies and procedures implemented, at hospitals and clinical trial sites as a result of any natural disaster or public health crisis; 

&#8226; the availability of cells suitable for the manufacture of our clinical product candidates from eligible and qualified donors for certain of our product candidates; 

&#8226; the availability of components and agents necessary to enroll and treat prospective patients in our clinical trials, including agents which may be required to condition patients or monoclonal antibodies which are intended for administration to patients in combination with our product candidates, in certain of our clinical trials; 

&#8226; the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment, including through remote monitoring if required as a result of precautionary changes implemented at clinical trial sites as a result of any public health crisis; and 

&#8226; the proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients. 

Moreover, development of certain of our product candidates as treatment for autoimmune diseases represents a novel approach, and no cell therapies have been approved for commercial use for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. As a consequence, use of cell therapies such as our product candidates for the treatment of autoimmune diseases may not gain the acceptance of the public or medical community. Our ability to enroll patients in our clinical trials for treatment of autoimmune diseases will depend upon the treatment practices of physicians who specialize in the treatment of autoimmune diseases targeted by our product candidates, and enrollment in our clinical trials may be impaired if physicians are reluctant to enroll patients into our clinical trials in lieu of, or in addition to, using existing treatments with which they are more familiar and for which more clinical data may be available. In addition, patient populations targeted for autoimmune diseases by our product candidates are typically not at risk of near-term death, even if they may suffer life-threatening symptoms, so these patients will need to deem the potential benefits of our cell therapy product candidates to be worth the risk of unknown potential adverse side effects. Furthermore, autoimmune disease patients and their physicians may choose to use conventional therapies, such as corticosteroids or systemic immunosuppressive medications, rather than participate in our clinical trials. 

In addition, certain of our clinical trial sites at times have delayed or paused patient enrollment in clinical trials as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain shortages, and may do so again in the future for a variety of reasons. The extent and duration of such delays and disruptions, and the overall impact on the timing and conduct of our clinical trials, are uncertain. If we have difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients to conduct our clinical trials as planned, we may need to delay or terminate ongoing or planned clinical trials, either of which would have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and market price of shares of our common stock. 

The clinical development of our product candidates could be substantially delayed if we are required to conduct unanticipated studies, including preclinical studies or clinical trials, or if the FDA imposes other requirements or restrictions including on the manufacture, of our product candidates. 

The FDA may require us to generate additional preclinical, product, manufacturing, or clinical data as a condition to continuing our current clinical trials, or initiating and conducting any future clinical trials of our current product candidates or other cell product candidates that we may identify. Additionally, the FDA may in the future have comments, or impose requirements, on the conduct of our clinical trials or the initiation of clinical trials or any of our other iPSC-derived cell product candidates, including the protocols, 

&#160; 

&#160; 

processes, materials and facilities we use to manufacture our product candidates and potential future product candidates in support of clinical trials. Any requirements to generate additional data, or redesign or modify our protocols, processes, materials or facilities, or other additional comments, requirements or impositions by the FDA, may cause delays in the initiation or conduct of the current or future clinical trials for our product candidates and subsequent development activities for our product candidates, and could require us to incur additional development or manufacturing costs and resources, seek funding for these increased costs or resources or delay our timeline for, or cease, our preclinical or clinical development activities for our product candidates, or could create uncertainty and additional complexity in our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. 

Further, if the results of our clinical trials are inconclusive, or if there are safety concerns or adverse events associated with our existing product candidates or any other product candidates we may identify, we may: 

&#8226; be delayed in obtaining, or unable to obtain, regulatory approval for such product candidates; 

&#8226; be required to amend the protocols for our clinical trials, perform additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials to support approval or be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; 

&#8226; obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired; 

&#8226; obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings or contraindications; or 

&#8226; in the event a product candidate is approved, have regulatory authorities withdraw their approval of the product or impose restrictions on its use. 

Even if our current and planned clinical trials are successful, we will need to conduct additional clinical trials, which may include registrational trials, trials in additional patient populations or under different treatment conditions, and trials using different manufacturing protocols, processes, materials or facilities or under different manufacturing conditions, before we are able to seek approvals for our product candidates from the FDA and regulatory authorities outside the United States to market and sell these product candidates. In addition, changes in regulatory policies or the administration as a result of the 2024 U.S. presidential election may result in delays in the regulatory review and approval process and cause uncertainty regarding approval pathways. If we fail to meet the requirements to support continued clinical development, our clinical development activities for any of our product candidates are delayed or suspended, or we fail to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals with an acceptable scope, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed. 

We are pursuing multiple programs and product candidates in our novel cell therapy development pipeline using an approach that is designed to enable rapid incorporation of new product features. If we elect to incorporate these new features into next-generation product candidates, this may render our existing product candidates obsolete, and we may devote our limited resources in pursuit of a particular program for which there is a greater potential for success and fail to capitalize on development opportunities or product candidates including those which may be more advanced in development. 

We focus on the development of programmed cellular immunotherapies for patients with cancer and autoimmune diseases, including off-the-shelf NK- and T-cell product candidates derived from clonal master engineered iPSC lines. Because our iPSC product platform is designed to enable rapid incorporation of novel functional product features in an evolving clinical setting, we may elect to incorporate these discoveries into next-generation product candidates that render our existing product candidates, including product candidates under clinical development, obsolete. Additionally, because we have limited financial and personnel resources, we may elect or be required to abandon or delay the pursuit of opportunities with existing or future product candidates, including those that may be more advanced in development than those we ultimately elect to pursue. For example, in January 2023, we announced the discontinuation of our FT516, FT596, FT538, and FT536 NK cell programs to focus our resources on advancing our most innovative and differentiated programs. We have also expanded our research and development efforts into areas outside of our initial focus in oncology, such as autoimmune diseases, where we have limited or no experience. Due to these factors, our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates and the scientific innovation arising from these expenditures, may not yield commercially viable product candidates. 

Our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit their commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences following any potential marketing approval. 

During the conduct of clinical trials, patients may report changes in their health, including illnesses, injuries and discomforts, to their doctor. Often, it is not possible to determine whether or not the product candidate being studied caused these conditions. Regulatory authorities may draw different conclusions and may require us to pause our clinical trials or require additional testing to 

&#160; 

&#160; 

confirm these determinations, if they occur. Drug-related side effects could also affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. 

In addition, it is possible that as we test our product candidates in larger, longer and more extensive clinical trials, or as use of these product candidates becomes more widespread if they receive regulatory approval, illnesses, injuries, discomforts and other adverse events that were not observed in earlier trials, as well as conditions that did not occur or went undetected in previous trials, may be reported by subjects or patients. Many times, drug-related side effects are only detectable after investigational products are tested in large-scale pivotal trials or, in some cases, after they are made available to patients on a commercial scale after approval. Furthermore, because certain autoimmune diseases we seek to treat may be less serious than the later stage cancers traditionally being treated with cell therapies or other immunotherapy products, we believe the FDA and other regulatory authorities will apply a different benefit-risk threshold such that any potential harmful side effects may outweigh the benefits of our product candidates and require us to cease clinical trials or result in denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates in autoimmune disease indications. Tolerance for adverse events in the autoimmune disease patient populations being pursued with cell-based therapies, such as in SLE patients in our FT819 clinical trial, is expected to be lower than it is in oncology, and the risks of negative impacts from these toxicities may therefore be greater for our autoimmune programs than for our oncology programs or the oncology programs of others. If any of our product candidates cause undesirable side effects or have unfavorable benefit-risk profiles, this may cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay, or halt clinical trials, and the development of the product candidate may fail or be delayed. If the product candidate receives regulatory approval, such undesirable side effects could result in a more restrictive label than anticipated or in the regulatory approval being revoked. Any such delay or failure as a result of undesirable side effects would harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 

Certain of our product candidates are being developed for the treatment of patient populations with significant comorbidities, particularly in the case of oncology patients, that may result in deaths or serious adverse events or unacceptable side effects and require us to abandon or limit our clinical development activities. 

Patients treated with our current product candidates, particularly in our clinical trials in oncology indications, may also receive chemotherapy, radiation, and/or other high dose or myeloablative treatments in the course of treatment of their disease, and may therefore experience side effects or adverse events, including death, that are unrelated to our product candidates. While these side effects or adverse events may be unrelated to our product candidates, they may still affect the success of our clinical studies. In particular, the oncology diseases we are studying have complex comorbidities and the patients enrolled in those studies are often critically ill. The inclusion of critically ill patients in our clinical studies may result in deaths or other adverse medical events due to underlying disease or to other therapies or medications that such patients may receive. Any of these events could prevent us from advancing our product candidates through clinical development, and from obtaining regulatory approval, and would impair our ability to commercialize our product candidates. Any inability to advance our existing product candidates or any other product candidate through clinical development would have a material adverse effect on our business, and the value of our common stock would decline. 

Because our product candidates are based on novel technologies, it is difficult to predict the regulatory approval process and the time, the cost and our ability to successfully initiate, conduct and complete clinical development, and obtain the necessary regulatory and reimbursement approvals, required for commercialization of our product candidates, if approved. 

Our cell programming technology and platform for generating cell therapy products using iPSCs represent novel therapeutic approaches, and to our knowledge there are currently no iPSC-derived cell products approved anywhere in the world for commercial sale. As such, it is difficult to accurately predict the type and scope of challenges we may incur during development of our product candidates, and we face uncertainties associated with the preclinical and clinical development, manufacture and regulatory requirements for the initiation and conduct of clinical trials, regulatory approval, and reimbursement required for successful commercialization of these product candidates. In addition, because our iPSC-derived cell product candidates are all in the early clinical or preclinical stage, we are currently assessing safety in humans and have not yet been able to assess the long-term effects of treatment. Animal models and assays may not accurately predict the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in our target patient populations, and appropriate models and assays may not exist for demonstrating the safety and purity of our product candidates, as required by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for ongoing clinical development and regulatory approval. 

The preclinical and clinical development, manufacture, and regulatory requirements for approval of novel product candidates such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than for other more well-known or extensively studied pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical product candidates due to a lack of prior experiences on the side of both developers and regulatory agencies. Additionally, due to the uncertainties associated with the preclinical and clinical development, manufacture, and regulatory requirements for approval of our product candidates, we may be required to modify or change our preclinical and clinical development plans or our manufacturing activities and plans, or be required to meet stricter regulatory requirements for approval. Any such 

&#160; 

&#160; 

modifications or changes could delay or prevent our ability to develop, manufacture, obtain regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Cellular immunotherapies, and iPSC-derived cell therapies in particular, represent relatively new therapeutic areas, and the FDA has cautioned consumers about potential safety risks associated with cell therapies. For example, in November 2023, the FDA announced that it would be conducting an investigation into reports of T-cell malignancies following BCMA-directed or CD19-directed autologous CAR T-cell immunotherapies following reports of T-cell lymphoma in patients receiving these therapies. In January 2024, the FDA determined that new safety information related to T-cell malignancies should be included in the labeling with boxed warning language on these malignancies for all BCMA- and CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T-cell immunotherapies. To date, there are relatively few approved cell therapies as treatments for cancer, and no cell-based therapies have been approved for commercial use for the treatment of an autoimmune disease. Currently, all approved CAR T-cell immunotherapies are in oncology indications, and there can be no assurance that the FDA will find the risks of treatment with cell therapy acceptable in other indications, such as autoimmune diseases. The development of any cell therapy may be placed on hold by the FDA upon the detection of any unexpected safety event to evaluate the potential relevance of such novel technology to the occurrence of such safety event, highlighting the technical and regulatory risk of working with new technology. As a result, the regulatory approval process for product candidates such as ours is uncertain and may be more expensive and take longer than the approval process for cell therapy product candidates based on other, better known or more extensively studied technologies and therapeutic approaches. 

Regulatory requirements in the United States and in other countries governing the development of cell therapy products and therapeutic products created with gene editing technology have changed frequently and the FDA or other regulatory bodies may change the requirements, or identify different regulatory pathways, for approval for any of our product candidates. For example, as regulatory expectations regarding cell therapy products and products created with gene editing technology continue to evolve, the FDA could require additional testing or new testing of products created with gene editing technology, including our product candidates, and any such additional FDA requirements for approval for any of our product candidates may adversely impact or slow development of our product candidates. The FDA previously established the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies (OTAT) within the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) to consolidate the review of cell therapy and related products, and to advise CBER on its review. In September 2022, the FDA announced retitling of OTAT to the Office of Therapeutic Products (OTP) and elevation of OTP to a &#8220;Super Office&#8221; to meet its growing cell and gene therapy workload and new commitments under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act agreement for fiscal years 2023-2027. It is possible that over time new or different divisions may be established or be granted the responsibility for regulating cell and/or gene therapy products, including iPSC-derived cell products made with gene editing technology, such as ours. The regulatory review divisions and committees, and any new guidelines they promulgate, may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to perform additional studies or clinical trials, and delay or prevent development, approval, and commercialization of our product candidates. As a result, we may be required to change our regulatory strategy or to modify our applications for regulatory approval, which could delay and impair our ability to complete the preclinical and clinical development and manufacture of, and obtain regulatory approval for, our product candidates. Changes in regulatory authorities and advisory groups, or any new requirements or guidelines they promulgate, may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to perform additional studies, increase our development and manufacturing costs, lead to changes in regulatory pathways, positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of our product candidates or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. As we advance our product candidates, we will be required to consult with the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and our product candidates will likely be reviewed by an FDA advisory committee. We also must comply with applicable requirements, and if we fail to do so, we may be required to delay or discontinue development of our product candidates. Delays or unexpected costs in obtaining, or the failure to obtain, the regulatory approval necessary to bring a potential product to market could impair our ability to generate sufficient product revenues to maintain our business. 

Preliminary data and interim results we disclose may change as more patient data becomes available or as we make changes to our protocols or manufacturing processes, and such interim results and results from earlier studies may not be predictive of the final results, or of later studies or future clinical trials. 

We may from time to time disclose results from preclinical testing or preliminary data or interim results from clinical studies of our product candidates. Such results from preclinical testing, process development and manufacturing activities, and clinical studies, including interim clinical trial results as of specified data cutoff dates and results of earlier clinical studies with similar product candidates, are not necessarily predictive of future results, including later clinical trial results. 

The results of our current and future clinical trials may differ from results achieved in earlier preclinical and clinical studies for a variety of reasons, including: 

&#8226; we may not demonstrate the potency and efficacy benefits observed in previous studies; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; our efforts to improve, standardize and automate the manufacture and supply of our product candidates and any resulting deviations in the manufacture of our product candidates, may adversely affect the safety, purity, potency, stability, or efficacy of such product candidates; 

&#8226; differences in study design, including differences in conditioning regimens, eligibility criteria, and patient populations; 

&#8226; advancements in the standard of care may affect our ability to demonstrate efficacy or achieve study endpoints in our current or future clinical trials; and 

&#8226; safety issues or adverse events in patients who enroll in our current or future clinical trials. 

Additionally, some of the data from clinical trials of our product candidates performed to date were generated from open-label studies, and these studies are being conducted at a limited number of clinical sites on a limited number of patients. An &#8220;open-label&#8221; clinical trial is one where both the patient and investigator know whether the patient is receiving the investigational product candidate or either an existing approved drug or placebo. Most typically, open-label clinical trials test only the investigational product candidate and sometimes may do so at different dose levels. Open-label clinical trials are subject to various limitations that may exaggerate any therapeutic effect as patients in open-label clinical trials are aware when they are receiving treatment. Open-label clinical trials may be subject to a &#8220;patient bias&#8221; where patients perceive their symptoms to have improved merely due to their awareness of receiving an experimental treatment. In addition, open-label clinical trials may be subject to an &#8220;investigator bias&#8221; where those assessing and reviewing the physiological outcomes of the clinical trials are aware of which treatment regimen patients have received and may interpret the information of the treated group more favorably given this knowledge. Accordingly, the preliminary data from our Phase 1 clinical trials of certain of our product candidates may not be predictive of future clinical trial results for these or other product candidates when studied in a controlled environment or larger patient populations. 

From time to time, we also publish interim, &#8220;top-line,&#8221; or preliminary data from our clinical studies based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data. Preliminary or interim data from clinical trials that we are conducting are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues, the duration of treatment increases and more patient data become available. For example, although we have, from time to time, reported positive interim clinical data for certain of our clinical programs, we may encounter dose-limiting toxicities or unacceptable side effects for these product candidates as dose escalation and expansion progresses in our clinical trials and additional patient data become available. Our preliminary or interim results and related conclusions also are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. Preliminary or &#8220;top-line&#8221; data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, interim and preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. Material adverse changes between preliminary, &#8220;top-line,&#8221; or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations. 

Results of clinical testing of any of our existing or future product candidates may fail to show the necessary safety and efficacy required for regulatory approval. 

Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any of our product candidates, we must complete preclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy in humans of any such product candidates. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete, and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Our product candidates have a limited history of being evaluated in human clinical trials. Any of our product candidates may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy in later stages of clinical development despite having successfully advanced through initial clinical trials. 

There is a high failure rate for drugs and biologics proceeding through clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in later stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in earlier stage clinical trials. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are subject to varying interpretations, which may delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval. In addition, regulatory delays or rejections may be encountered as a result of many factors, including changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development. 

If our product candidates are ultimately not approved for any reason, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected. In addition, the standard of care may change with the approval of new products for the same indications that we are studying. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Even if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate, our products will remain subject to regulatory scrutiny. 

Any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing protocols, processes, materials and facilities, qualification testing, post-approval clinical data, labeling and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual and additional requirements of the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information, reports, registration and listing requirements, requirements relating to cGMP, applicable product tracking and tracing requirements, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, and recordkeeping. Even if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to conditions of approval, or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. Additionally, under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 (FDORA), sponsors of approved drugs and biologics must provide 6 months&#8217; notice to the FDA of any changes in marketing status, such as the withdrawal of a drug, and failure to do so could result in the FDA placing the product on a list of discontinued products, which would revoke the product&#8217;s ability to be marketed. The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical and biological products to ensure such products are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our product candidates, manufacturing operations, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may lead to various adverse conditions, including significant delays in bringing our product candidates to market and/or being precluded from manufacturing or selling our product candidates, any of which could significantly harm our business. 

We may seek regenerative medicine advanced therapy (RMAT) designation for certain of our product candidates, but such designation may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process and we may be unable to obtain or maintain the benefits associated with such designation. 

We may seek RMAT designation from the FDA for certain of our product candidates. A product candidate is eligible for RMAT designation if: (1) it is a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell or tissue product, or a combination product using any such therapies or products; (2) it is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and (3) there is preliminary clinical evidence that indicates that the product candidate has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. This program is intended to facilitate efficient development and expedite review of RMATs. A Biologics License Application (BLA) for a product candidate with RMAT designation may be eligible for priority review or accelerated approval through (1) surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit or (2) reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites. Benefits of such designation also include early interactions with the FDA to discuss any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoint to be used to support accelerated approval. A product candidate that has RMAT designation and is subsequently granted accelerated approval and is subject to post-approval requirements may fulfill such requirements through the submission of clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real-world evidence, such as electronic health records; the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to its approval. RMAT designation is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe one of our product candidates meets the criteria for RMAT designation, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to grant such designation. In any event, the receipt of RMAT designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to product candidates considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one or more of our product candidates qualifies for RMAT designation, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification. 

We may rely on orphan drug status to develop and commercialize certain of our product candidates, but orphan drug designations may not confer marketing exclusivity or other expected commercial benefits and we may not be able to obtain orphan drug designations for our other product candidates. 

We may rely on orphan drug exclusivity for product candidates that we may develop. Orphan drug status confers seven years of marketing exclusivity in the United States under the Federal Food Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and up to ten years of marketing exclusivity in Europe for a particular product in a specified indication, subject to certain conditions. However, we may be unable to obtain orphan drug designations for any of our product candidates that we are currently developing or may pursue. Even if we do obtain orphan drug designations and are the first to obtain marketing approval of our product candidates for the applicable indications, we will not be able to rely on these designations to exclude other companies from manufacturing or selling biological products using the same principal molecular structural features for the same indication beyond these time-frames. Furthermore, any marketing exclusivity in Europe can be reduced from ten years to six years if the initial designation criteria have significantly changed since the market authorization of the orphan product. 

For any product candidate for which we may be granted orphan drug designation in a particular indication, it is possible that another company also holding orphan drug designation for the same product candidate will receive marketing approval for the same 

&#160; 

&#160; 

indication before we do. If that were to happen, our applications for that indication may not be approved until the competing company&#8217;s period of exclusivity expires. Even if we are the first to obtain marketing authorization for an orphan drug indication in the United States, there are circumstances under which a competing product may be approved for the same indication during the seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, such as if the later product is shown to be clinically superior to our orphan product, or if the later product is deemed a different product than ours. Further, the seven-year marketing exclusivity would not prevent competitors from obtaining approval of the same product candidate as ours for indications other than those in which we have been granted orphan drug designation, or for the use of other types of products in the same indications as our orphan product. 

We may seek designation for our cell programming technology as a designated platform technology, but we might not receive such designation, and even if we do, such designation may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process. 

We may seek designation for our cell programming technology as designated platform technology. Under FDORA, a platform technology incorporated within or utilized by a drug or biological product is eligible for designation as a designated platform technology if (1) the platform technology is incorporated in, or utilized by, a drug approved under a BLA or New Drug Application (NDA); (2) preliminary evidence submitted by the sponsor of the approved or licensed drug, or a sponsor that has been granted a right of reference to data submitted in the application for such drug, demonstrates that the platform technology has the potential to be incorporated in, or utilized by, more than one drug without an adverse effect on quality, manufacturing, or safety; and (3) data or information submitted by the applicable person indicates that incorporation or utilization of the platform technology has a reasonable likelihood to bring significant efficiencies to the drug development or manufacturing process and to the review process. A sponsor may request the FDA to designate a platform technology as a designated platform technology concurrently with, or at any time after, submission of an IND application for a drug that incorporates or utilizes the platform technology that is the subject of the request. If so designated, the FDA may expedite the development and review of any subsequent original BLA or NDA for a drug that uses or incorporates the platform technology. Even if we believe our cell programming technology meets the criteria for such designation, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to grant such designation. In addition, the receipt of such designation for a platform technology does not ensure that a drug will be developed more quickly or lead to a faster FDA review or approval process and does not assure ultimate FDA approval of a drug. Moreover, the FDA may revoke a designation if the FDA determines that a designated platform technology no longer meets the criteria for such designation. 

We may seek approval of one or more of our product candidate into real-time oncology review (RTOR). This program may not lead to a faster regulatory review or approval process and does not increase the likelihood that our product candidate(s) will receive marketing approval. 

Participation in RTOR is voluntary. Our acceptance into RTOR does not guarantee or influence approval of our application, which is subject to the same statutory and regulatory requirements for approval as applications that are not included in RTOR. Although early approvals have occurred with applications selected for RTOR, this may not be the case for our application even if it is selected for RTOR. If at any time the FDA determines our participation in RTOR, if selected, is no longer appropriate, the FDA may rescind our acceptance and instruct us to follow routine submission procedures for marketing approval. 

We may be subject to certain regulations, including federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, physician payment transparency laws, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and health information privacy and security laws. Any actual or perceived failure to comply with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. 

If we obtain FDA approval for any of our product candidates and begin commercializing those products in the United States, our operations may be subject to various federal and state healthcare laws, including, without limitation, fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. Additionally, we may be subject to state and foreign equivalents of such healthcare laws and regulations, some of which may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of the payor, as well as patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge and may not comply under one or more of such laws, regulations, and guidance. Law enforcement authorities are increasingly focused on enforcing fraud and abuse laws, and it is possible that some of our practices may be challenged under these laws. Efforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements with third parties, and our business generally, will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. If our operations, including our arrangements with physicians and other healthcare providers are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and 

&#160; 

&#160; 

state healthcare programs (such as Medicare and Medicaid), and imprisonment, as well as additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. For more information, please see &#8220;Business&#8212;Government Regulation&#8212;Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements.&#8221; 

The scope and enforcement of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Ensuring that our internal operations and future business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. 

The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the European Union. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is also governed by the national anti-bribery laws of European Union Member States, such as the UK Bribery Act 2010. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and individual imprisonment. 

Payments made to physicians in certain European Union Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician&#8217;s employer, his or her competent professional organization and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual European Union Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the European Union Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or individual imprisonment. 

A variety of risks associated with conducting research and clinical trials abroad and marketing our product candidates internationally could materially adversely affect our business. 

We plan to develop and potentially commercialize our product candidates worldwide. Accordingly, we expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries, including: 

&#8226; differing regulatory requirements in foreign countries; 

&#8226; unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements; 

&#8226; increased difficulties in managing the logistics and transportation of storing and shipping product candidates produced in the United States and shipping the product candidate to the patient abroad; 

&#8226; import and export requirements and restrictions; 

&#8226; economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets; 

&#8226; compliance with data privacy regulations in foreign countries; 

&#8226; compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad; 

&#8226; foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes; 

&#8226; foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country; 

&#8226; difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations; 

&#8226; workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States; 

&#8226; differing payor reimbursement regimes, governmental payors or patient self-pay systems, and price controls; 

&#8226; potential liability under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or comparable foreign regulations; 

&#8226; challenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States; 

&#8226; production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and 

&#8226; business interruptions resulting from ongoing and emerging geopolitical tensions, including wars, armed conflicts or acts of terrorism. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

These and other risks associated with our potential international operations may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or maintain profitable operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 

We may decide to conduct clinical trials for our product candidates outside the United States, and the FDA may not accept data from trials conducted in such locations. 

To date, we have only conducted clinical trials in the United States. However, we may in the future choose to conduct one or more of our clinical trials or include sites in current or future clinical trials outside the United States. 

Although the FDA may accept data from sites or clinical trials outside the United States, acceptance of these data is subject to conditions imposed by the FDA. The FDA will generally not consider the data from a foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND unless (i) the trial was well-designed and well-conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements, including requirements for the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials in a way that provides assurance that the data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, safety, and well-being of trial subjects are protected, and (ii) the FDA is able to validate the data from the trial through an onsite inspection, if necessary. In cases where data from foreign clinical trials are intended to serve as the sole basis for marketing approval in the United States, the FDA will generally not approve the application on the basis of foreign data alone unless (i) the data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice; (ii) the trials were performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence; and (iii) the data may be considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection by the FDA or, if the FDA considers such as inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means. Additionally, the FDA&#8217;s clinical trial requirements, including sufficient size of patient populations and statistical powering must be met. Many foreign regulatory authorities have similar approval requirements. In addition, while these clinical trials or trial sites are subject to the applicable local laws where the trials are conducted, FDA acceptance of the data will depend on its determination that the trials or trial sites also complied with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that the FDA will accept data from trials conducted outside the United States. If the FDA does not accept the data from any trial or trial site outside the United States, it would likely result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and would delay or halt our development of the applicable product candidates. 

Existing regulatory policies may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. 

In June 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court overruled the Chevron doctrine, which gives deference to regulatory agencies&#8217; statutory interpretations in litigation against federal government agencies, such as the FDA, where the law is ambiguous. This decision may result in more lawsuits against the FDA to challenge longstanding decisions and policies of the FDA, which could undermine the FDA&#8217;s authority, lead to uncertainties in the industry, and disrupt the FDA&#8217;s normal operations, any of which could delay the FDA&#8217;s review of our regulatory submissions. We cannot predict the full impact of this decision, future judicial challenges brought against the FDA, or the nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained, and we may not achieve or sustain profitability. 

Risks Related to Our Financial Condition 

Our ongoing and planned operations, including the development of our product candidates, will require substantial additional funding, without which we will be unable to complete preclinical or clinical development of, or obtain regulatory approval for, or commercialization of our product candidates. 

We are currently advancing multiple product candidates through clinical development, and conducting preclinical research and development activities in other programs. Drug development is expensive, and we expect our research and development expenses to remain significant in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance our current product candidates in clinical trials and seek to initiate clinical development for additional product candidates. 

As of December 31, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents, and investments were $306.7 million. We intend to use our cash, cash equivalents, investments primarily to fund the advancement and clinical development of our current product candidates and our ongoing preclinical, discovery and research programs, and for working capital and general corporate purposes. However, our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings, government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic and licensing arrangements or a combination of these approaches. In any event, we will require additional capital to obtain regulatory approval for, and to commercialize our existing product candidates and any other 

&#160; 

&#160; 

product candidates we may identify and develop. Even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans, we may seek additional capital if market conditions are favorable or if we have specific strategic considerations. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to: 

&#8226; the progress, results, size, timing and costs of our ongoing and planned clinical trials, and any additional clinical trials we may initiate, conduct or support for our product candidates; 

&#8226; the progress, results, size, timing and costs of our preclinical, process development and manufacturing studies, and activities necessary to initiate and conduct clinical trials for our product candidates and to establish and maintain manufacturing capabilities necessary to support such trials; 

&#8226; continued progress in our research and development programs, including preclinical studies, process development, manufacturing and other research activities that may be necessary in order for an IND application to go into effect for a prospective clinical development candidate, as well as potential future clinical trials of any additional product candidates we may identify for development; 

&#8226; the extent to which we are required to pay milestone or other payments under our existing in-license agreements and any in-license agreements that we may enter into in the future, and the timing of such payments, including payments owed to Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) in connection with the stock price appreciation milestones; 

&#8226; our ability and the ability of our investigators to initiate and conduct, and the progress, results, size, timing and costs of, clinical trials of our product candidates that will be necessary to support any application for regulatory approval; 

&#8226; our ability to manufacture, or enter into arrangements with third parties for the manufacture of our existing product candidates, as well as potential future clinical development candidates, both for clinical development and commercialization, and the timing and costs associated with such manufacture; 

&#8226; our ability to maintain, expand and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, or other costs we may incur, in connection with the licensing, filing, prosecution, defense and enforcement of any patents or other intellectual property rights; 

&#8226; the cost of manufacturing, distribution, and commercialization activities and arrangements, including the manufacturing of our product candidates, establishment of effective protocols for the supply and transport of our product candidates, and the establishment of a sales and marketing organization either internally or in partnership with a third party; and 

&#8226; our ability to establish and maintain strategic arrangements and alliances with third-party collaborators including our existing collaborations with Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Ono), the University of Minnesota, and MSKCC, to advance the research, development and commercialization of therapeutic products. 

Any additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Moreover, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders and the issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline. The sale of additional equity or convertible securities would dilute all of our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment and interest obligations and we may be required to agree to certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. We could also be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or otherwise at a different stage than otherwise would be desirable and we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects. In addition, while the overall impacts of the ongoing and emerging geopolitical tensions, including wars and other armed conflicts, on the global economy remain unknown and difficult to predict, these events caused significant disruptions and created uncertainties in the global financial markets, and the economic impacts of these and other similar global events could materially and adversely affect our ability to raise capital through equity or debt financings in the future. 

If we cannot raise additional capital or obtain adequate funds, we may be required to curtail significantly our research and clinical programs or may not be able to continue our research or clinical development of our product candidates. Our failure to raise additional capital, or obtain adequate funds, will have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and market price of shares of our common stock. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We have a limited operating history, have incurred significant losses since our inception, and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. 

We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company formed in 2007 with a limited operating history. We have not yet obtained regulatory approval for any of our product candidates or generated any revenues from therapeutic product sales. Since inception, we have incurred significant net losses in each year and, as of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.4 billion. We expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to fund our ongoing and planned clinical trials of our product candidates and our other ongoing and planned research and development activities. We also expect to incur significant operating and capital expenditures as we continue our research and development of, and seek regulatory approval for, our product candidates, in-license or acquire new product candidates for development, implement additional infrastructure and internal systems, and hire additional scientific, clinical, and administrative personnel. We anticipate that our net losses for the next several years could be significant as we conduct our planned operations. 

Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical, biological, and cell therapy product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. In addition, our expenses could increase if we are required by the FDA, or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, to perform studies or trials in addition to those currently expected, or if there are any delays in completing our clinical trials, preclinical studies, process development, manufacturing activities, or the research and development of any of our product candidates. The amount of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of increase in our expenses, our ability to generate revenues and our ability to raise additional capital. These net losses have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our stockholders&#8217; equity and working capital. 

We have broad discretion over the use of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments and may not use them effectively. 

Our management has broad discretion to use our cash, cash equivalents, investments and any additional funds that we may raise to fund our operations and could spend these funds in ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our common stock. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could result in financial losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, cause the price of our common stock to decline or delay the development of our product candidates. We may invest our cash and cash equivalents in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value. 

Risks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties 

We are, and expect to continue to be, dependent on third parties to conduct some or all aspects of manufacturing of our product candidates for use in clinical trials and for commercial sale, if approved. Our business could be harmed if those third parties fail to perform satisfactorily. 

While we currently manufacture clinical supplies of our iPSC-derived cell product candidates at our cGMP facilities located in San Diego, California, we also rely on third parties to manufacture certain components required for the manufacture of our product candidates, and we may rely on third parties to conduct some or all aspects of manufacturing of our product candidates for use in conducting later stage clinical trials and for commercial sale upon approval of any of our product candidates. 

Reliance on third parties for manufacture of our product candidates and components utilized in manufacturing our product candidates entails certain risks, including reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, the possibility that the third-party manufacturer does not maintain the financial, personnel or other resources to meet its obligations, the possibility that the third party fails to manufacture such components, or our product candidates or any products we may eventually commercialize, in accordance with our specifications, misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how, and the possibility of termination of our manufacturing relationship by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or damaging to us. In addition, the FDA and other regulatory authorities require that our product candidates and any products that we may eventually commercialize be manufactured according to cGMP, cGTP and similar jurisdictional standards. These requirements include, among other things, quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. The FDA or similar foreign regulatory agencies may also implement new standards at any time, or change their interpretations and enforcement of existing standards for manufacture, packaging or testing of products. We have little control over our manufacturers&#8217; compliance with these regulations and standards. 

In some cases, the technical skills required to manufacture our product candidates may be unique or proprietary to a particular CMO, and we may have difficulty, or there may be contractual restrictions prohibiting us from, transferring such skills to a back-up or alternate supplier if needed, or we may be unable to transfer such skills at all. In addition, if we are required to change contract manufacturers for any reason, we will be required to verify that the new CMO maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations. We will also need to verify, such as through a manufacturing comparability 

&#160; 

&#160; 

study, that any new manufacturing process will produce our product candidate according to the specifications previously submitted to the FDA or another regulatory authority. The delays associated with the verification of a new CMO could negatively affect our ability to develop product candidates or commercialize our products in a timely manner or within budget. In addition, changes in manufacturers often involve changes in manufacturing procedures and processes, which could require that we conduct bridging studies between our prior clinical supply used in our clinical trials and that of any new manufacturer. We may be unsuccessful in demonstrating the comparability of clinical supplies produced by different manufacturers, which could require the conduct of additional clinical trials. 

Further, we depend in some instances on third party suppliers, including sole source suppliers, for the provision of reagents, materials, devices and equipment that are used by us and our third-party contract manufacturers in the production of our product candidates, including certain of our iPSC-derived cell therapy product candidates. Any disruption to or loss of supply from any of these suppliers could delay our clinical development and commercialization efforts, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. 

We depend on strategic partnerships and collaboration arrangements for the development and commercialization of certain of our product candidates in certain indications or geographic territories, and if these arrangements are terminated or are unsuccessful, this could result in delays and other obstacles in the development, manufacture or commercialization of any of our product candidates and materially harm our results of operations. 

Our strategy for fully developing and commercializing our product candidates is dependent upon maintaining our current arrangements and establishing new arrangements with research collaborators, corporate collaborators and other third parties. We currently have a corporate collaboration agreement with Ono; our collaboration with Janssen terminated effective April 2023. Our collaboration agreement with Ono provides for, among other things, research funding and significant future payments should certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones be achieved. Under our arrangement with Ono and any future corporate arrangements that we may form, our corporate collaborators may be responsible for: 

&#8226; electing to advance product candidates through preclinical and into clinical development; 

&#8226; conducting clinical development and obtaining required regulatory approvals for product candidates; and 

&#8226; commercializing any resulting products. 

As a result, we may not be able to conduct such corporate collaborations in the manner or on the time schedule we currently contemplate, which may negatively impact our business operations. 

Our lack of control over the research funding for, and the development and commercialization of, certain of our product candidates being developed under the collaboration and option agreement we entered into with Ono on September 14, 2018 (as amended to date, the Ono Agreement) and any other product candidates that we may develop under a future arrangement could cause delays or other difficulties in the development and commercialization of any of our product candidates, which may prevent completion of research and development activities and intended regulatory filings in a timely fashion, if at all. Because we expect to continue to rely on our current collaborator and to enter into new collaborations in the future, the development and commercialization of any of our product candidates could be substantially delayed, and our ability to receive future funding could be substantially impaired, if one or more of our current or future collaborators: 

&#8226; shifts its priorities and resources away from our collaborations due to a change in business strategies, or a merger, acquisition, sale or downsizing of its company or business unit; 

&#8226; ceases development in therapeutic areas which are the subject of our collaboration; 

&#8226; fails to select a product candidate for advancement into preclinical development, clinical development, or subsequent clinical development into a marketed product; 

&#8226; changes the success criteria for a particular product candidate, thereby delaying or ceasing development of such product candidate; 

&#8226; significantly delays the initiation or conduct of certain activities which could delay our receipt of milestone payments tied to such activities, thereby impacting our ability to fund our own activities; 

&#8226; develops a product candidate that competes, either directly or indirectly, with our product candidates; 

&#8226; does not obtain the requisite regulatory approval of a product candidate; 

&#8226; does not successfully commercialize a product candidate; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#8226; encounters regulatory, resource or quality issues and is unable to meet demand requirements; 

&#8226; exercises its rights under the agreement to terminate the collaboration, as Janssen did in January 2023, or otherwise withdraws support for, or otherwise impairs or delays development under the collaboration; 

&#8226; disagrees on the research, development or commercialization of a product candidate resulting in a delay in milestones, royalty payments or termination of such product candidate; and 

&#8226; uses our proprietary information or intellectual property in such a way as to jeopardize our rights in such property. 

In addition, the termination of the Ono Agreement or any future strategic partnership or collaboration arrangement that we enter into may prevent us from receiving any milestone, royalty payment, sharing of profits, and other benefits under such agreement. Furthermore, disagreements with these parties could require or result in litigation or arbitration, which would be time-consuming and expensive. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop and commercialize any of our product candidates and may adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Cell-based therapies depend on the availability of reagents and specialized materials and equipment which in each case are required to be acceptable to the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies, and such reagents, materials, and equipment may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. We rely on third-party suppliers for various components, materials and equipment required for the conduct of our clinical trials and the manufacture of our product candidates and do not have supply arrangements for certain of these components. 

The development and manufacturing of our product candidates requires many reagents and other specialty materials and equipment, some of which are manufactured or supplied by small companies with limited resources and experience to support commercial biologics production. To date, we and our CMOs have purchased equipment, materials and disposables used for the manufacture of our existing product candidates from third-party suppliers. Some of these suppliers may not have the capacity to support commercial products manufactured under cGMP by biopharmaceutical firms or may otherwise be ill-equipped to support our needs. Reagents and other key materials from these suppliers may have inconsistent attributes and introduce variability into our manufactured product candidates, which may contribute to variable patient outcomes and possible adverse events. We rely on the general commercial availability of materials and equipment required for the manufacture of our product candidates, and do not have supply contracts with many of these suppliers and may not be able to obtain supply contracts with them on acceptable terms or at all. Even if we are able to enter into such contracts, we may be limited to a sole third-party for the supply of certain required components and equipment. 

In addition, the clinical development of our product candidates depends on the availability of certain materials and agents used in our clinical trials. For example, we intend to develop certain of our product candidates as a combination therapy with other cancer therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies, requiring availability and use of these monoclonal antibodies in certain of our clinical trial protocols. Additionally, in October 2024, the FDA reported a shortage of certain intravenous solutions which are required for the conduct of our clinical trials. We cannot predict the extent and duration of this shortage of these intravenous solutions, although any failure or delays by us or by our clinical sites to obtain sufficient quantities of materials and agents required under our protocols, or other components and agents necessary for the conduct of our clinical trials, may delay our ability to enroll and treat patients in, or complete, our current or future clinical trials of our product candidates on time, if at all. 

As a result of any public health crises, the business and operations of our suppliers and other third parties which produce agents and materials used in our clinical trials or manufacturing of our product candidates may be disrupted or delayed, and we in turn may experience disruptions or delays in our supply chain. A delay or inability to continue to source product or materials from any of these suppliers or third parties, which could be due to the impacts of any public health crises, natural disasters (including due to the effects of climate change), ongoing and emerging global geopolitical tensions, including wars and other armed conflicts, regulatory actions or requirements affecting the supplier, adverse financial or other strategic developments experienced by a supplier, labor disputes or shortages, unexpected demands, or quality issues, could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our product candidates and our ability to conduct clinical trials, which could significantly harm our business. 

If we are required to change suppliers, or modify the components, equipment, materials or disposables used for the manufacture of our product candidates, we may be required to change our manufacturing operations or clinical trial protocols or to provide additional data to regulatory authorities in order to use any alternative components, equipment, materials or disposables, any of which could set back, delay, or increase the costs required to complete our clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates. Additionally, any such change or modification may adversely affect the safety, efficacy, stability, or potency of our product candidates, and could adversely affect our clinical development of our product candidates and harm our business. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We currently rely on third parties to conduct certain research and development activities and clinical trials of our product candidates. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to timely develop, manufacture, obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business could be substantially harmed. 

We rely upon third parties, including medical institutions, clinical investigators, and clinical research organizations (CROs) for the conduct of certain research and preclinical development activities, process development and manufacturing activities, and for the conduct, management, and supervision of clinical trials of our product candidates. We do not have direct control over the activities of these third parties, and may have limited influence over their actual performance. Our reliance on these third parties and CROs does not relieve us of our responsibilities to ensure that our clinical studies are conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal and regulatory requirements and scientific standards. 

We are responsible for complying, and we are responsible for ensuring that our third-party service providers and CROs comply, with applicable GCP for conducting activities for all of our product candidates in clinical development, including conducting our clinical trials, and recording and reporting data from these trials. Regulatory authorities enforce these regulations through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. We cannot assure that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with applicable GCP requirements. In addition, our registrational clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under applicable regulatory requirements. 

If these third parties and CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations, meet expected deadlines or successfully complete activities as planned, or if the quality or accuracy of the research, preclinical development, process development, manufacturing, or clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to applicable regulatory and manufacturing requirements or for other reasons, our research, preclinical development, process development and manufacturing activities, and clinical trials, and the development of our product candidates, may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. Further, if our agreements with third parties or CROs are terminated for any reason, the development of our product candidates may be delayed or impaired, and we may be unable to advance our product candidates. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed or impaired. 

If conflicts arise between us and our collaborators or strategic partners, these parties may act in a manner adverse to us and could limit our ability to implement our strategies. 

If conflicts arise between our corporate or academic collaborators or strategic partners and us, the other party may act in a manner adverse to us and could limit our ability to implement our strategies. Some of our academic collaborators and strategic partners are conducting multiple product development efforts within each area that is the subject of the collaboration with us. Our collaborators or strategic partners, however, may develop, either alone or with others, products in related fields that are competitive with the products or potential products that are the subject of these collaborations. Competing products, either developed by the collaborators or strategic partners or to which the collaborators or strategic partners have rights, may result in the withdrawal of our collaborators&#8217; or partners&#8217; support for our product candidates. 

Some of our collaborators or strategic partners could also become our competitors in the future. Our collaborators or strategic partners could develop competing products, preclude us from entering into collaborations with their competitors, fail to obtain timely regulatory approvals, terminate their agreements with us prematurely, or fail to devote sufficient resources to the development and commercialization of our product candidates. Any of these developments could harm our product development efforts. 

We may also rely on certain third-party vendors located in China or who are owned by or are associated with certain Chinese companies to assist in non-clinical or clinical trials or provide laboratory services. It is unknown how current or future geopolitical relationships with China or specific Chinese-owned or associated vendors may affect our ability to complete our non-clinical or clinical trials. 

We currently, and may in the future, do business with one or more companies located in China, or that are owned or operated by Chinese companies to provide non-clinical or clinical trial support services. The process of changing these vendors could have an adverse impact on our current clinical development programs if they were no longer permitted to provide services or products due to geopolitical pressures, including legislative activities or executive orders aimed at prohibiting certain Chinese or Chinese-owned biotechnology companies from engaging in biotechnology or biopharmaceutical research activities. We could experience delays in finding suitable replacement service providers located outside China or not otherwise owned by or associated with Chinese companies, which could have a material adverse effect on our development activities and our business. We are unable to predict whether or when proposed legislative or executive actions would be effective, and whether such changes would materially and 

&#160; 

&#160; 

adversely affect our liquidity, access to capital and our ability to conduct business. Any failure on our part to comply with changing government regulations and policies could result in the loss of our ability to manufacture and develop our product candidates. 

Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property 

If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and product candidates, other companies could develop products based on our discoveries, which may reduce demand for our products and harm our business. 

Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our product candidates, the operations used to manufacture them and the methods for using them, and also for our cell programming technology in order to prevent third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our product candidates or otherwise exploiting our cell programming approach. The scope of patent protection in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. One aspect of the determination of patentability of our inventions depends on the scope and content of the &#8220;prior art,&#8221; information that was or is deemed available to a person of skill in the relevant art prior to the priority date of the claimed invention. There may be prior art of which we are not aware that may affect the patentability of our patent claims or, if issued, affect the validity or enforceability of a patent claim. Further, we may not be aware of all third-party intellectual property rights potentially relating to our product candidates or their intended uses, and as a result the impact of such third-party intellectual property rights upon the patentability of our own patents and patent applications, as well as the impact of such third-party intellectual property upon our freedom to operate, is highly uncertain. Because patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for typically a period of 18 months after filing, or may not be published at all, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to our product candidates. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability, and commercial value of our patent rights are uncertain. We own and have exclusive licenses to patent portfolios for our product candidates and cell programming technology, although we cannot be certain that our existing patents and patent applications provide adequate protection or that any additional patents will issue to us with claims that provide adequate protection of our other product candidates. Further, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be enforced in our patents if we attempt to enforce them or if they are challenged in court or in other proceedings. If we are unable to secure and maintain protection for our product candidates and cell programming technology, or if any patents we obtain or license are deemed invalid and unenforceable, our ability to commercialize or license our technology could be adversely affected. 

Others have filed, and in the future are likely to file, patent applications covering products and technologies that are similar, identical or competitive to ours or important to our business. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, and some remain so until issued, we cannot be certain that any patent application owned by a third party will not have priority over patent applications filed or in-licensed by us, or that we or our licensors will not be involved in interference, opposition, reexamination, review, reissue, post grant review or invalidity proceedings before U.S. or non-U.S. patent offices. The scope, validity or enforceability of our patents or the patents of our licensors may be challenged in such proceedings in either the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad, and our business may be harmed if the coverage of our patents or the patents of our licensors is narrowed, or if a patent of ours or our licensors is judged invalid or unenforceable, in any such proceedings. 

Furthermore, our intellectual property rights may be subject to a reservation of rights by one or more third parties. For example, the research resulting in certain of the patent rights and technology that we own or have licensed was funded in part by the U.S. government. As a result, the government has certain rights, including march-in rights, to such patent rights and technology. When new technologies are developed with government funding, the government generally obtains certain rights in any resulting patents, including a non-exclusive license authorizing the government to use the invention or to have others use the invention on its behalf. These rights may permit the government to disclose our information to third parties and to exercise march-in rights to use or allow third parties to use our technology. The government can exercise its march-in rights if it determines that action is necessary because we fail to achieve practical application of the government-funded technology, because action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs, to meet requirements of federal regulations, or to give preference to U.S. industry. In addition, our rights in such inventions may be subject to certain requirements to manufacture products embodying such inventions in the United States. Any exercise by the government of such rights or by any third party of its reserved rights could harm our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 

We depend on our licensors to prosecute and maintain patents and patent applications that are material to our business. Any failure by our licensors to effectively protect these intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business and operations. 

Certain rights to our key technologies and product candidates, including intellectual property relating to our iPSC technology, are licensed from third parties. As a licensee of third-party intellectual property, we rely on our licensors to file and prosecute patent 

&#160; 

&#160; 

applications and maintain patents, and otherwise protect the licensed intellectual property under some of our license agreements. We have not had and do not have primary control over these activities for certain of our licensed patents, patent applications and other intellectual property rights, and we cannot be certain that such activities will result in valid and enforceable patents and other intellectual property rights. Additionally, our licensors may have the right to control enforcement of our licensed patents or defense of any claims asserting the invalidity of these patents and we cannot be certain that our licensors will allocate sufficient resources or prioritize enforcement of such patents or defense of such claims to protect our interests in the licensed patents. Even if we are not a party to these legal actions, an adverse outcome could harm our business because it might prevent us from continuing to license intellectual property that we may need to operate our business. 

If we fail to comply with our obligations under our license agreements, we could lose rights to our product candidates or key technologies. 

We have obtained rights to develop, market and sell some of our product candidates through intellectual property license agreements with third parties. These license agreements impose various diligence, milestone payment, royalty and other obligations on us. In particular, under our Amended MSKCC License with MSKCC, in the event a licensed product achieves a specified clinical milestone, MSKCC is eligible to receive from us certain milestone payments totaling up to $75.0 million based on the price of our common stock, where the amount of such payments owed to MSKCC is contingent upon certain increases in the price of our common stock following the date of achievement of such clinical milestone. If we fail to comply with our obligations under our license agreements, including any payment obligations, we could lose some or all of our rights to develop, market and sell products covered by these licenses, and our ability to form collaborations or partnerships may be impaired. In addition, disputes may arise under our license agreements with third parties, which could prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms and to develop and commercialize the affected product candidates. 

We are and may become involved in litigation or other proceedings from time to time relating to the enforcement or defense of patent and other intellectual property rights, which could cause us to divert our resources and could put our intellectual property at risk. 

To prevent infringement or unauthorized use of our intellectual property, we have in the past, and may in the future, need to file infringement claims. For example, in May 2022, we filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the Southern District of California against Shoreline Biosciences, Inc. (see &#8220;Item 3. Legal Proceedings&#8221; for a more detailed description of this matter). When we pursue litigation to stop another party from using the inventions claimed in any patents we own or control, that party has the right to ask the court to rule that such patents are invalid or should not be enforced against that third party. In addition to patent infringement lawsuits, we may decide to file interferences, oppositions, ex parte reexaminations, post-grant review, or inter partes review proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the USPTO) and corresponding foreign patent offices. Litigation and other proceedings relating to intellectual property are unpredictable and expensive and may consume time and resources and divert the attention of managerial and scientific personnel. Such litigations and proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for research, development, and other activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings or may be required to divert such resources from our ongoing and planned research and development activities. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating or successfully challenging our intellectual property rights. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. 

There also is a risk that a court or patent office in such proceeding will decide that our patents or the patents of our licensors are not valid or are not enforceable, and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the inventions. Additionally, even if the validity of such patents is upheld, the court may refuse to stop the other party on the ground that such other party&#8217;s activities do not infringe our rights to such patents. If we are not successful in enforcing or defending our intellectual property, our competitors could develop and market products based on our discoveries and technologies, which may reduce the commercial viability of, and demand for, our product candidates and any future products. 

We or our strategic partners may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may prevent or delay our product development efforts and stop us from commercializing, or increase the costs of commercializing, our product candidates. 

Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions, ex parte reexaminations, post-grant review, and inter partes review proceedings before the USPTO and corresponding foreign patent offices. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are developing product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights or misappropriation of other intellectual property rights of third parties. 

We cannot be certain that any of our patent searches or analyses, including the identification of relevant patents, the scope of patent claims or the expiration of relevant patents, are complete or thorough, nor can we be certain that we have identified each and every third-party patent and pending application in the United States and abroad that is relevant to or necessary for the commercialization of our product candidates in any jurisdiction. The scope of a patent claim is determined by an interpretation of the law, the written disclosure in a patent and the patent&#8217;s prosecution history. Our interpretation of the relevance or the scope of a patent or a pending application may be incorrect, which may negatively impact our ability to market our products. We may incorrectly determine that our products are not covered by a third-party patent or intellectual property rights or may incorrectly predict whether a third-party&#8217;s pending application will issue with claims of relevant scope. Our determination of the expiration date of any patent in the United States or abroad that we consider relevant may be incorrect, which may negatively impact our ability to develop and market our product candidates. Our failure to identify and correctly interpret relevant patents may negatively impact our ability to develop and market our products. 

We cannot guarantee that the manufacture, use or marketing of our existing product candidates or any other product candidates that we develop, or the use of our cell programming technology, will not infringe third-party patents. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, cell compositions, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates. Our competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering products and technologies similar to ours. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. 

Third parties asserting their patent or other intellectual property rights against us may seek and obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of management and other employee resources from our business, cause development delays, and may impact our reputation. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys&#8217; fees for willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, pay royalties, or redesign our infringing products, which may be impossible on a cost-effective basis or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. In that event, we would be unable to further develop and commercialize our product candidates, which could harm our business significantly. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business. 

We may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining necessary rights to product components and processes for development or manufacture of our product candidates which may cause us to operate our business in a more costly or otherwise adverse manner that was not anticipated. 

We own or license from third parties certain intellectual property rights necessary to develop and manufacture our product candidates. The growth of our business will likely depend in part on our ability to acquire or in-license additional proprietary rights, including to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates. In that event, we may be required to expend considerable time and resources to develop or license replacement technology. For example, our programs may involve additional technologies or product candidates that may require the use of additional proprietary rights held by third parties. Furthermore, other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies and academic institutions may also have filed or may be planning to file patent applications potentially relevant to our business. From time to time, in order to avoid infringing these third-party patents, we may be required to license technology from additional third parties to further develop or commercialize our product candidates. We may be unable to acquire or in-license any relevant third-party intellectual property rights, including any such intellectual property rights required to manufacture, use or sell our product candidates, that we identify as necessary or important to our business operations. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all, and as a result we may be unable to develop or commercialize the affected product candidates, which would harm our business. We may need to cease use of the compositions or methods covered by such third-party intellectual property rights, and may need to seek to develop alternative approaches or technology that do not infringe on such intellectual property rights which may entail additional costs and development delays, even if we were able to develop such alternatives, which may not be feasible. Even if we are able to obtain a license under such intellectual property rights, any such license may be non-exclusive, which may allow our competitors&#8217; access to the same technologies licensed to us. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Additionally, we sometimes collaborate with academic institutions to accelerate our preclinical research or development under written agreements with these institutions. Typically, these institutions provide us with an option to negotiate a license to any of the institution&#8217;s rights in technology resulting from the collaboration. Regardless of such option, we may be unable to negotiate a license within the specified timeframe or under terms that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to do so, the institution may offer the intellectual property rights to other parties, potentially blocking our ability to pursue our program. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property or to maintain the existing intellectual property rights we have, we may have to abandon development of such program and our business and financial condition could suffer. 

The licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive practice, and companies that may be more established, or have greater resources than we do, may also be pursuing strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider necessary or attractive in order to commercialize our product candidates. More established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their larger size and cash resources or greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, it may be more costly for us to secure and maintain the necessary patent protection to block third parties from using our technology than to negotiate out-licenses or similar agreements with these parties to provide them with limited rights to use our technology. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete any such negotiations and ultimately acquire or maintain, on commercially viable terms, the rights to the intellectual property required for the successful development and commercialization of our product candidates. 

Intellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage. 

The degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations and may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. For example: 

&#8226; others may be able to make product candidates that are similar to ours but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed; 

&#8226; we or our licensors or future collaborators might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we own or have exclusively licensed; 

&#8226; we or our licensors or future collaborators might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions; 

&#8226; others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights; 

&#8226; it is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents; 

&#8226; issued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors; 

&#8226; our competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets; 

&#8226; we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; 

&#8226; we cannot predict the scope of protection of any patent issuing based on our patent applications, including whether the patent applications that we own or in-license will result in issued patents with claims that cover our product candidates or uses thereof in the United States or in other foreign countries; 

&#8226; the claims of any patent issuing based on our patent applications may not provide protection against competitors or any competitive advantages, or may be challenged by third parties; 

&#8226; if enforced, a court may not hold that our patents are valid, enforceable and infringed; 

&#8226; we have initiated, and may from time to time initiate, litigation or administrative proceedings to enforce and/or defend our patent rights which will be costly whether we win or lose; 

&#8226; we may choose not to file a patent in order to maintain certain trade secrets or know-how, and a third party may subsequently file a patent covering such intellectual property; 

&#8226; we may fail to adequately protect and police our trademarks and trade secrets; and 

&#8226; the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business, including if others obtain patents claiming subject matter similar to or improving that covered by our patents and patent applications. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Should any of these events occur, they could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects. 

We may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets. 

In conducting our business operations, we have obtained confidential and proprietary information from third parties. In addition, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants and independent contractors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers or other parties. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we could lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, which could adversely affect our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. 

We may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship of our patents and other intellectual property. 

We may be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators, or other third parties have an interest in our patents or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. If we fail in defending any such claims, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. We may also be subject to monetary damages, and any of these outcomes could have a material adverse impact on our business. 

Proprietary information and invention assignment agreements with our employees and third parties may not prevent unauthorized disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information. 

In addition to the protection afforded by patents, we also rely upon unpatented trade secrets and improvements, proprietary know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position, which we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants. We also have invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and some, but not all, of our collaborators and consultants. Because we expect to rely on third parties in the development and manufacture of our product candidates, we must, at times, share trade secrets with them, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our trade secrets will be misappropriated or disclosed. 

Trade secrets, however, may be difficult to protect, and any disclosure, either intentional or unintentional, by our employees or third-party consultants and vendors that we engage to perform research, clinical trials or manufacturing activities, or misappropriation by third parties (such as through a cybersecurity breach) of our trade secrets or proprietary information could enable competitors to duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, thus eroding our competitive position in our market. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees or former employees, consultants, outside scientific advisors, contractors, and collaborators might intentionally or inadvertently disclose our trade secret information to competitors. In addition, competitors may otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor or other third-party, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad. If we are unable to prevent unauthorized material disclosure of our intellectual property to third parties, or misappropriation of our intellectual property by third parties, we will not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. 

We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world. 

Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on our product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop 

&#160; 

&#160; 

their own products and may also export infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with any products that we may develop and commercialize, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. 

Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology and pharmaceutical products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license. 

Changes in the patent law in the United States could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our product candidates and technology. 

As is the case with other biotechnology companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property rights, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biotechnology industry involve both technological and legal complexity, and therefore obtaining and enforcing biotechnology patents is costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the United States has recently enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. 

The term of our patents may not be sufficient to effectively protect our market position and products. 

Patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after it is filed. Various extensions may be available; however, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if we obtain patents covering our product candidates, once the patent life has expired for a product, we may be open to competition from other products. If the lives of our patents are not sufficient to effectively protect our products and business, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected. 

Risks Related to the Commercialization of Our Product Candidates 

We do not have experience marketing any product candidates and do not have a sales force or distribution capabilities, and if our products are approved, we may be unable to commercialize them successfully. 

We currently have no experience in marketing and selling therapeutic products, including obtaining and maintaining adequate pricing and reimbursements. If any of our product candidates are approved for marketing, we intend to establish marketing and sales capabilities internally or we may selectively seek to enter into partnerships with other entities to utilize their marketing and distribution capabilities. If we are unable to develop adequate marketing and sales capabilities on our own or effectively partner with third parties, our ability to generate product revenues will suffer. 

The commercial success of our product candidates will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payers and others in the medical community. 

The commercial success of our products, if approved for marketing, will depend in part on the medical community, patients and third-party payers accepting our product candidates as effective and safe. If these products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenue and may not become profitable. For example, in November 2023, the FDA announced that it would be conducting an investigation into reports of T-cell malignancies following BCMA-directed or CD19-directed autologous CAR T-cell immunotherapies following reports of T-cell lymphoma in patients receiving these therapies. In January 2024, the FDA determined that new safety information related to T-cell malignancies should be included in the labeling with boxed warning language on these malignancies for all BCMA- and CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T-cell immunotherapies. FDA&#8217;s investigation into CAR T-cell therapies and other similar actions could result in increased government 

&#160; 

&#160; 

regulation, unfavorable public perception and publicity, stricter labeling requirements for those product candidates that are approved, and a decrease in demand for any such product candidates. The degree of market acceptance of our products, if approved for marketing, will depend on a number of factors, including: 

&#8226; the safety and efficacy of the products, and advantages over alternative treatments; 

&#8226; the labeling of any approved product; 

&#8226; the prevalence and severity of any side effects, including any limitations or warnings contained in a product&#8217;s approved labeling; 

&#8226; the clinical indications for which any product candidate is approved; 

&#8226; the emergence, and timing of market introduction, of competitive products; 

&#8226; the effectiveness of our marketing strategy; 

&#8226; the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies; 

&#8226; obtaining and maintaining adequate pricing and reimbursement; and 

&#8226; sufficient third-party insurance coverage or governmental reimbursement, which may depend on our ability to provide compelling evidence that a product meaningfully improves health outcomes to support such insurance coverage or reimbursement. 

The patient populations targeted by our autoimmune product candidates are also typically not at risk of near-term death, even if they may suffer life-threatening symptoms, so those patients will need to deem the benefits of cell therapy to be worth the risk of unknown potential adverse side effects. Our success in this space will depend upon physicians who specialize in the treatment of autoimmune diseases targeted by our product candidates prescribing treatments that involve the use of our product candidates in lieu of, or in addition to, existing treatments with which they are more familiar and for which greater clinical data may be available. 

Even if a potential product displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile in preclinical studies and clinical trials, market acceptance of the product will not be known until after it is launched. Any failure to achieve market acceptance for our product candidates will harm our business, results and financial condition. 

We expect to face uncertainty regarding the pricing of our existing product candidates and any other product candidates that we may develop. If pricing policies for our product candidates are unfavorable, our commercial success will be impaired. 

Due to the novel nature of our cellular immunotherapy product candidates, we face significant uncertainty as to the pricing of any such products for which we may receive marketing approval. While we anticipate that pricing for any cellular immunotherapy product candidates that we develop will be relatively high due to their anticipated use in the prevention or treatment of life-threatening diseases where therapeutic options are limited, the biopharmaceutical industry has recently experienced significant pricing pressures. In particular, drug pricing and other healthcare costs continue to be subject to intense political and societal pressures, which we anticipate will continue and escalate on a global basis. These pressures may result in harm to our business and reputation, cause our stock price to decline or experience periods of volatility and adversely affect results of operations and our ability to raise funds. 

The insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newly-approved products is uncertain. Failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates could limit our product revenues. 

Our ability to commercialize any of our product candidates successfully will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement for these products from third-party payors, including government health administration authorities, private health insurers, and other managed care organizations. The availability and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payors is essential for most patients who generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs of their care, including treatments such as cellular immunotherapy. Because our product candidates represent new approaches to the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases, there is significant uncertainty as to the insurance coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private payors tend to follow CMS determinations to a substantial degree. If reimbursement or insurance coverage is not available for our product candidates, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be sufficient to allow us to establish or maintain pricing to generate income. Factors payors consider in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is: (i) a 

&#160; 

&#160; 

covered benefit under its health plan; (ii) safe, effective and medically necessary; (iii) appropriate for the specific patient; (iv) cost-effective; and (v) neither experimental nor investigational. For more information, please see &#8220;Business&#8212;Government Regulation&#8212;Coverage and Reimbursement.&#8221; 

In addition, reimbursement agencies in foreign jurisdictions may be more conservative than those in the United States. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenues and profits. Moreover, increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payors, in the United States and abroad, to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and level of reimbursement for new products approved and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates. Failure to obtain or maintain adequate reimbursement for any products for which we receive marketing approval will adversely affect our ability to achieve commercial success, and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products, and our overall financial condition. 

If the market opportunities for our product candidates are restricted or smaller than we believe they are, our revenues may be adversely affected and our business may suffer. Because the target patient populations of our product candidates may be small and variable, we must be able to successfully identify patients and capture a significant market share to achieve and maintain profitability. 

We focus our research and development on product candidates for rare diseases, including cancer and autoimmune diseases. The FDA often approves new therapies initially for use in patients with relapsed or refractory disease. We expect to initially seek approval of our product candidates in these settings. Subsequently, for those products that prove to be sufficiently beneficial, if any, we would expect to seek approval in earlier lines of treatment. There is no guarantee that our product candidates, even if approved, would be approved for earlier lines of therapy, and, prior to any such approvals, we will have to conduct additional clinical trials, including potentially comparative trials against approved therapies. Certain of our product candidates also target similar patient populations as autologous cell therapy product candidates, including approved autologous CAR T products. Our therapies may not be as safe and effective as approved autologous CAR T therapies and as a result, such product candidates may only be approved for patients who are ineligible for autologous CAR T therapy. 

Our projections of the number of people who have or will have the diseases we may be targeting, as well as the subset of patients with these cancers in a position to receive second or later lines of therapy and who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our product candidates, may prove to be incorrect. Further, new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases. The number of patients in the United States, Europe and elsewhere may turn out to be lower than expected, or the potentially addressable patient population for our product candidates may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with our product candidates, all of which would adversely affect our results of operations and our business. Additionally, because our target patient populations may be small and variable, we may never achieve profitability without capturing a significant market share or obtaining regulatory approval for additional indications for our products. 

Healthcare legislative or regulatory reform measures may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. 

In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Payors, whether domestic or foreign, or governmental or private, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the health care system that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. Additional changes that may affect our business include those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, rules regarding prescription drug benefits under the health insurance exchanges and fraud and abuse and enforcement. Continued implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the passage of additional laws and regulations may result in the expansion of new programs such as Medicare payment for performance initiatives, and may impact existing government healthcare programs, such as by improving the physician quality reporting system and feedback program. For more information regarding the risks related to recently enacted and future legislation please see &#8220;Business &#8211; Government Regulation &#8211; Healthcare Reform and Other Regulatory Changes.&#8221; 

There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices.&#8239; Specifically, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, and review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payers of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect: 

&#8226; the demand for any of our product candidates, if approved; 

&#8226; the ability to set a price that we believe is fair for any of our product candidates, if approved; 

&#8226; our ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability; 

&#8226; the level of taxes that we are required to pay; and 

&#8226; the availability of capital. 

We expect that additional U.S. federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that the U.S. federal government will pay for healthcare drugs and services, which could result in reduced demand for our drug candidates or additional pricing pressures. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain drug access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce the ultimate demand for our drugs or put pressure on our drug pricing, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 

In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court&#8217;s 2024 decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo overruled the Chevron doctrine, which for 40 years required federal courts to defer to permissible agency interpretations of statutes that are silent or ambiguous on a particular topic. In Loper Bright, the Supreme Court held that the U.S. Administrative Procedure Act requires courts to exercise their independent judgment when deciding whether an agency has acted within its statutory authority, and that courts may not defer to an agency interpretation solely because a statute is ambiguous. This landmark Supreme Court decision may invite more companies and other stakeholders to bring lawsuits against the FDA to challenge longstanding decisions and policies of the FDA, which could undermine the FDA&#8217;s authority, lead to uncertainties in the industry, and disrupt the FDA&#8217;s normal operations, any of which could delay the FDA&#8217;s review of our regulatory submissions. We cannot predict the full impact of this decision, future judicial challenges brought against the FDA, or the nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action. Any such challenges, if successful, could have an impact on our business, and any such impact could be material. In addition to potential changes to regulations and agency guidance as a result of legal challenges, these decisions may result in increased regulatory uncertainty and delays in and other impacts to the agency rulemaking process, any of which could adversely impact our business and operations. 

Risks Related to Our Business and Industry 

The success of our existing product candidates is substantially dependent on developments within the field of cellular immunotherapy, and specifically developments relating to the use of pluripotent or genome edited cells for the manufacture of cellular therapeutics, the majority of which are beyond our control. 

Our product candidates are designed and are being developed as therapeutic entities for use as cellular immunotherapies, and all of our current product candidates are based on our novel iPSC product platform. Additionally, some of our product candidates utilize novel genome editing technologies. To date, there is limited clinical trial experience testing iPSC-derived therapeutic product candidates using genome edited cells. The fields of cellular and genome edited therapies are evolving, and as more therapeutic product candidates derived from pluripotent and genome edited cells are reviewed by regulatory authorities, regulatory authorities may impose additional requirements for approval that were not previously anticipated. There have also been several significant adverse events from gene therapy treatments in the past, including reported cases of leukemia and death. Additionally, in November 2023, the FDA announced that it would be conducting an investigation into reports of T-cell malignancies following BCMA-directed or CD19-directed autologous CAR T-cell immunotherapies following reports of T-cell lymphoma in patients receiving these therapies. In January 2024, the FDA determined that new safety information related to T-cell malignancies should be included in the labeling with boxed warning language on these malignancies for all BCMA- and CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T-cell immunotherapies. There can be no assurance that any product candidates developed from or related to our iPSC product platform or any of our research programs will not cause severe or undesirable side effects or result in significant delays or unanticipated costs, or that such development problems can be solved. Any adverse developments in the fields of cellular immunotherapy or genome edited 

&#160; 

&#160; 

therapy, such as FDA&#8217;s investigation into CAR T-cell therapies and other similar actions, could negatively affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. 

We face intense competition in an environment of rapid technological and scientific progress from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that are commercializing, have developed or may develop product candidates for the treatment of the diseases that we may target, including companies developing novel therapies and platform technologies. If these companies develop product candidates or platform technologies more rapidly than we do, if their commercialized products or product candidates are more effective, more cost effective, or have fewer side effects, or if they compete in various other aspects of our business, our ability to develop and successfully commercialize product candidates and to execute on our business plans will be adversely affected. 

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid and significant innovation, particularly in the areas of immune-oncology and the development and commercialization of cell therapies. We compete with a variety of large pharmaceutical companies, multinational biopharmaceutical companies, other biopharmaceutical companies and specialized biotechnology companies, as well as technology and/or therapeutics being developed at universities and other research institutions. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources, such as larger research and development staff, more experienced manufacturing organizations and facilities and greater sales and marketing organizations. Third parties are commercializing, have developed, are developing or may develop product candidates, platform technologies and processes that compete with ours. Competitive therapeutic treatments include those that have already been approved and accepted by the medical community, as well as novel treatments that are currently in preclinical or clinical development or may otherwise enter the market. We believe that a significant number of product candidates are currently under development, including various cellular immunotherapies as well as multifunctional targeted antibodies, such as bi-specific and tri-specific T-cell engagers, which may become commercially available in the future for the treatment of indications, including a variety of cancers, for which we are developing or may try to develop our product candidates. Additionally, several companies with experience and knowledge in the development of CAR T-cell therapies for oncology indications have now commenced the development of cell therapies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases where B cells may play a role in initiating or maintaining disease affected populations, and the product candidates these companies develop may be competitive with product candidates that we are developing for autoimmune diseases. Should one or more of these competing product candidates or other competing product candidates of which we are not aware receive regulatory approval or otherwise achieve clinical or commercial success, our regulatory strategy could be impaired, our ability to obtain regulatory approval could be delayed or prevented, or the market for our products may be reduced or eliminated, thereby harming or preventing our commercial success. 

Even if we successfully obtain approval for any product candidate, we will face competition based on many different factors, including the relative safety and efficacy of our product candidates, the actual or perceived quality of patient life while undergoing treatment with our product candidates, the ease with which our product candidates can be administered, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals for these product candidates, the availability and cost of manufacturing, marketing and sales capabilities, pricing, reimbursement coverage and patent positions, and the relative prioritization of our product candidates by physicians and healthcare providers among available therapies. Competing products and product candidates could present superior treatment alternatives, including by being more effective, safer, less expensive or marketed and sold more effectively than any products we may develop. Competitive products and product candidates may also make any product we develop obsolete or noncompetitive before we recover the expense of developing and commercializing such product. We could also face competition from other companies for collaboration partners, employees, advisors and service providers, which could negatively impact our ability to execute our business plans. 

Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient, or are less expensive or more commercially viable than any products that we may develop. Furthermore, currently approved products could be discovered to have application for treatment of our targeted disease indications or similar indications, which could give such products significant regulatory and market timing advantages over our product candidates. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours and may obtain orphan product exclusivity from the FDA for indications that we are targeting, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Additionally, products or technologies developed by our competitors may render our product candidates uneconomical or obsolete and we may not be successful in marketing those product candidates, once approved, against competitors. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our ability to compete effectively with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies depends on our ability to distinguish our company and our product candidates from our competitors and their product candidates. 

Some of our competitors may have, and new competitors or alliances may emerge that have, greater name and brand recognition, greater market share, a larger customer base, more widely adopted proprietary technologies, greater marketing expertise, larger sales forces, and/or significantly greater resources than we do and may be able to offer solutions competitive with ours at a more attractive price. Further, our current or potential competitors may be acquired by third parties with greater available resources. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements and may have the ability to initiate or withstand substantial price competition. In addition, our competitors may in the future establish cooperative relationships with vendors of complementary products, technologies or services to increase the availability of their solutions in the marketplace. Our competitors could also be better positioned to serve certain segments of our market, which could create additional price pressure. In light of these factors, even if any products that we may develop are more effective than those of our competitors, current or potential customers may accept competitive products in lieu of purchasing our products. If we are unable to successfully compete, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 

The loss of any member of our senior management team or our inability to attract and retain key personnel and consultants could adversely affect our business. 

We are highly dependent upon the efforts of our senior management team and other key personnel. The loss of services of any of these individuals could delay or prevent the successful development of our product pipeline, initiation or completion of our preclinical studies and clinical trials or the commercialization of our product candidates. Although we have executed offer letters with each member of our senior management team, these agreements are terminable at will without notice and, therefore, we may not be able to retain their services as expected. Our former Chief Financial Officer resigned in June 2024. Our former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) retired on December 31, 2024, transitioning to an advisory role, and our former President of Research and Development assumed the role of CEO effective January 1, 2025. Management transitions may create uncertainty and involve a diversion of resources and management attention, be disruptive to our daily operations or impact public or market perception, any of which could negatively impact our ability to operate effectively or execute our strategies. 

We may not be able to retain or attract qualified management, finance, scientific and clinical personnel and consultants due to the intense competition for a limited number of qualified personnel and consultants among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses. We may also experience difficulties in attracting or retaining personnel with sufficient experience and skills in the complex and emerging field of cellular therapeutic development and manufacture to support our ongoing and planned clinical development activities. We currently rely, and for the foreseeable future will continue to rely, in substantial part on certain independent organizations, advisors and consultants. There can be no assurance that the services of independent organizations, advisors and consultants will continue to be available to us on a timely basis when needed, or that we can find qualified replacements. We may also be subject to penalties or other liabilities if we misclassify employees as consultants. In addition, if we are unable to effectively manage our outsourced activities or if the quality or accuracy of the services provided by consultants is compromised for any reason, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of our product candidates or otherwise advance our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our existing consultants or find other competent outside contractors and consultants on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Further, some of the qualified personnel that we hire and recruit are not U.S. citizens; changes to U.S. immigration policies, particularly to H-1B and other visa programs, could restrain the flow of technical and professional talent into the United States and may inhibit our ability to hire qualified personnel. 

To induce valuable employees to remain at our company, in addition to salary and cash incentives, we have provided stock options and restricted stock unit (RSU) awards that vest over time. The value to employees of stock options and RSU awards that vest over time has been significantly affected by movements in our stock price that are beyond our control and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. A significant number of our employee options remain underwater and may not provide the intended incentive for employees to remain at our company. 

Many of the biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that we compete against for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources and different risk profiles than we do. We may be required to provide compensation in excess of historical levels in order to recruit and retain personnel in the current market. If we are not able to retain and attract necessary personnel and consultants to perform the requisite operational roles and accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will significantly impede the achievement of our development objectives, our ability to raise additional capital and our ability to implement our business strategy. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

If we engage in an acquisition, reorganization or business combination, we will incur a variety of risks that could adversely affect our business operations or our stockholders. 

From time to time, we have considered, and we will consider in the future, strategic business initiatives intended to further the expansion and development of our business. These initiatives may include acquiring businesses, technologies or products or entering into business combinations with other companies. If we pursue such a strategy, we could, among other things: 

&#8226; issue equity securities that would dilute our current stockholders&#8217; percentage ownership; 

&#8226; incur substantial debt that may place strains on our operations; 

&#8226; spend substantial operational, financial and management resources to integrate new businesses, technologies and products; 

&#8226; assume substantial actual or contingent liabilities; 

&#8226; reprioritize our development programs and even cease development and commercialization of our product candidates; or 

&#8226; merge with, or otherwise enter into a business combination with, another company in which our stockholders would receive cash or shares of the other company on terms that certain of our stockholders may not deem desirable. 

Although we intend to evaluate and consider acquisitions, reorganizations and business combinations in the future, we have no agreements or understandings with respect to any acquisition, reorganization or business combination at this time. 

We face potential product liability exposure far in excess of our limited insurance coverage. 

The use of our product candidates in clinical trials, and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval, exposes us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by participants in clinical trials, hospitals, medical centers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies, and consumers, or by others selling, manufacturing or otherwise coming into contact with our product candidates. We carry product liability insurance and we believe our product liability insurance coverage is sufficient in light of our current clinical programs. In addition, if and when we obtain marketing approval for product candidates, we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products; however, we may be unable to obtain insurance coverage for any approved products on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. 

On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs or medical treatments that had unanticipated adverse effects. In addition, under some of our agreements with clinical trial sites, we are required to indemnify the sites and their personnel against product liability and other claims. A successful product liability claim, or a series of claims, brought against us or any third parties whom we are required to indemnify could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could adversely affect our results of operations and business. 

Patients with the diseases targeted by our product candidates are often already in severe and advanced stages of disease and have both known and unknown significant pre-existing and potentially life-threatening health risks. During the course of treatment, patients may suffer adverse events, including death, for a variety of reasons. Such events, whether or not resulting from our product candidates, could subject us to costly litigation, require us to pay substantial amounts of money to injured patients, delay, negatively affect or end our opportunity to receive or maintain regulatory approval to market our products, or require us to suspend or abandon our commercialization efforts. Even in a circumstance in which we do not believe that an adverse event is related to our products, the investigation into the circumstance may be time-consuming or inconclusive. These investigations may interrupt our development and commercialization efforts, delay our regulatory approval process, or impact and limit the type of regulatory approvals our product candidates receive or maintain. As a result of these factors, a product liability claim, even if successfully defended, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Our insurance policies are expensive and protect us from only some risks, which leaves us exposed to significant uninsured liabilities. 

We do not carry insurance for all categories of risk to which our business is or may be exposed. Some of the policies we maintain include general liability, product liability, property, employee benefits liability, employment practices, workers&#8217; compensation, cybersecurity, directors&#8217; and officers&#8217; insurance, and umbrella. We do not know, however, if we will be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts or scope to protect us against losses. Even if we obtain insurance, a claim could exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or it may be excluded from coverage under the terms of the policy. Any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would adversely affect our cash position and results of operations. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our employees or third party service providers may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading. 

We are exposed to the risk of employee or third party service provider fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees or third party service providers could include intentional failures to comply with the regulations of the FDA or foreign regulators, to provide accurate information to the FDA or foreign regulators, to comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, to report financial information or data accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. Employee or third party service provider misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. If any actions alleging such conduct are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant effect on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions. 

We face risks of potential liability related to the privacy of personal information, including health information we utilize in the development of our products, as well as information we obtain from clinical trials sponsored by us from research institutions and directly from individuals. 

We and our partners and vendors may be subject to various federal, state, and foreign data protection laws and regulations (i.e., laws and regulations that address privacy and data security). In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including federal health information privacy laws, state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our collaborators, including the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and privacy and security requirements under HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH). Depending on the facts and circumstances, we could be subject to civil, criminal, and administrative penalties if we knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. There is no certainty that all of our employees, agents, suppliers, manufacturers, contractors, or collaborators, or those of our affiliates, will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, particularly given the high level of complexity of these laws. Even when HIPAA does not apply, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers&#8217; personal information secure may constitute a violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act. In addition, certain of the materials we use as starting material in our iPSC-derived product candidates are derived from human sources, which potentially contain sensitive identifiable personal information regarding the donor. In addition, in conducting our clinical trials, we may maintain sensitive identifiable personal information, including health information, that we receive throughout the clinical trial process, in the course of our research collaborations, and directly from individuals (or their healthcare providers) who enroll in our clinical trials. As such, we may become subject to further obligations under HIPAA. Our collection of personal information generally (e.g., of employees currently and/or of patients in the future) may subject us to state data privacy laws governing the processing of personal information and requiring notification of affected individuals and state regulators in the event of a breach of such personal information. These state laws include the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (the CCPA), which establishes data privacy rights for residents of the State of California, with corresponding obligations on businesses related to transparency, deletion rights, and opt-out of the selling or sharing of personal information, and grants a private right of action for individuals in the event of certain security breaches. Similar laws relating to data privacy and security have passed in numerous other states, which may have potentially conflicting requirements that would make compliance challenging, require us to expend significant resources to come into compliance, and restrict our ability to process certain personal information. Moreover, some states have advanced privacy laws focused on protecting consumer health information, such as Washington&#8217;s My Health My Data Act, and this remains a rapidly changing legislative and regulatory environment. 

Certain state laws may be more stringent or broader in scope than the CCPA, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to confidential, sensitive and personal information than federal, international or other state laws, and such laws may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts. 

An increasing number of foreign data protection laws, regulations and industry standards may also apply to personal information we obtain from individuals outside of the United States. For example, the European Union&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) and the United Kingdom&#8217;s General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) impose strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the EEA and UK, including health-related data, and on the transfer of personal data out of the European Economic Area (EEA) and United Kingdom (UK) to non-adequate territories such as the United States; any inability to transfer personal data from the EEA and UK to the United States in compliance with data protection laws may impede our ability to conduct trials and may adversely affect our business and financial position. Failure to comply with the requirements of the EU GDPR 

&#160; 

&#160; 

may result in potential fines for companies of up to the greater of &#8364;20 million (&#163;17.5 million for the UK GDPR) or 4% of annual global revenue and other administrative penalties. In addition, under the EU GDPR and UK GDPR, companies may face private litigation related to processing of personal data brought by classes of data subjects or consumer protection organizations authorized at law to protect their interests. Although the EU GDPR and the UK GDPR currently impose substantially similar obligations, it is possible that over time the UK GDPR could become less aligned with the EU GDPR, particularly with the introduction of the new Data Reform Bill into the UK legislative process. In addition, EEA Member States have adopted national laws to supplement the EU GDPR, which may partially deviate from the EU GDPR, and the competent authorities in the EEA Member States may interpret EU GDPR obligations slightly differently from country to country, such that we do not expect to operate in a uniform legal landscape in the EEA and UK with respect to data protection regulations. The potential of the respective provisions and enforcement of the EU GDPR and UK GDPR further diverging in the future creates additional regulatory challenges and uncertainties for us. The lack of clarity on future UK laws and regulations and their interaction with EU laws and regulations could add legal risk, uncertainty, complexity and compliance cost to the handling of European personal data and our privacy and data security compliance, and could require us to amend our processes and procedures to implement different compliance measures for the UK and the EEA. 

In December 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice issued regulations implementing Executive Order (&#8220;EO&#8221;) 14117, &#8220;Preventing Access to Americans&#8217; Bulk Sensitive Personal Data and United Stated Government-Related Data by Countries of Concern,&#8221; which are expected to become effective in April 2025. These regulations prohibit transactions involving access to bulk sensitive data by countries of concern, such as China (including Hong Kong). In the life sciences sector, the regulations prohibit investment agreements, employment agreements, vendor agreements, and other transactions involving human genomic data and biospecimens, except where necessary for specified exempt activities. Tracking and complying with these regulations may require significant time and expense. 

We are likely to be required to expend significant capital and other resources to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable data privacy and security laws. Claims that we have violated individuals&#8217; privacy rights or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend, and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business. Moreover, even if we take all necessary action to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, we could be subject to a data breach or other unauthorized access of personal information, which could subject us to fines and penalties, as well as litigation and reputational damage. If we fail to keep apprised of and comply with applicable international, federal, state, or local regulatory requirements, we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions that could affect our or any collaborators&#8217; ability to seek to commercialize our clinical candidates. Any threatened or actual government enforcement action or litigation could also generate adverse publicity, damage our reputation, result in liabilities, fines and loss of business, and require that we devote substantial resources that could otherwise be used in other aspects of our business. 

We make public statements about our use and disclosure of personal information through our privacy policy information provided on our internet platform and press statements. Although we endeavor to comply with our public statements and documentation, we may at times fail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so. Moreover, despite our efforts, we may not be successful in achieving compliance if our employees or contractual partners fail to comply with our published policies, certifications and documentation. The publication of our privacy policy and other statements that provide promises and assurances about data privacy and security can subject us to potential government or legal action if they are found to be deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative of our actual practices. Any failure, real or perceived, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any legal or regulatory requirements, standards, certifications or orders or other privacy or consumer protection-related laws and regulations applicable to us could cause our prospective customers to reduce their use of our products and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In many jurisdictions, enforcement actions and consequences for non-compliance can be significant and are rising. In addition, from time to time, concerns may be expressed about whether our products or processes compromise the privacy of customers and others. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, retention, security, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal information or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Many statutory requirements, both in the United States and abroad, include obligations for companies to notify individuals of security breaches involving certain personal information, which could result from breaches experienced by us or our third-party service providers. For example, laws in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia require businesses to provide notice to consumers whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. These laws are not consistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach is difficult and may be costly. We also may be contractually required to notify customers or other counterparties of a security breach. Although we may have contractual protections with our third-party service providers, contractors and consultants, any actual or perceived security breach could harm our reputation and brand, expose us to potential liability or require us to expend significant resources on data security and in responding to any such actual or perceived breach or security incident. Any contractual protections we may have from our third-party service providers, contractors or consultants may not 

&#160; 

&#160; 

be sufficient to adequately protect us from any such liabilities and losses, and we may be unable to enforce any such contractual protections. 

In addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits, regulatory investigations, public censure, other claims and penalties, and significant costs for remediation and damage to our reputation, we could be materially and adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded in a manner that requires changes in our data processing practices and policies or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively impact our business. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business. Any inability to adequately address data privacy or security-related concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with applicable laws, regulations, standards and other obligations relating to data privacy and security, could result in additional cost and liability to us, harm our reputation and brand, damage our relationships with contract partners and the physician and patient community and have a material and adverse impact on our business. 

The increasing use of artificial intelligence-based software (including machine learning) may result in reputational harm or liability or could otherwise adversely affect our business. 

The use of artificial intelligence-based software is increasingly being used in the biopharmaceutical and global healthcare industries. As with many developing technologies, artificial intelligence-based software presents risks and challenges that could affect its further development, adoption, and use, and therefore our business. For example, algorithms may be flawed; data sets may be insufficient, of poor quality, or contain biased information; and inappropriate or controversial data practices by data scientists, engineers, and end-users could impair results. If the analyses that artificial intelligence (AI) applications assist in producing are deficient or inaccurate, we could be subjected to competitive harm, potential legal liability, and reputational harm. Furthermore, use of AI-based software may lead to the inadvertent release of confidential information which may impact our ability to realize the benefit of our intellectual property rights. 

A growing number of legislators and regulators are adopting laws and regulations and have focused enforcement efforts on the adoption of AI, and use of such technologies in compliance with ethical standards and societal expectations. For example, the EU&#8217;s Artificial Intelligence Act (&#8220;AI Act&#8221;) imposes significant obligations on providers and deployers of AI systems, and encourages providers and deployers of AI systems to account for EU ethical principles in their development and use of these systems. Likewise, in the United States, several states, including Colorado and California, passed laws to regulate various uses of AI, including to make consequential decisions. In addition, various federal regulators have issued guidance and focused enforcement efforts on the use of AI in regulated sectors. The FDA, for example, issued guidance on the use of AI in medical devices, requiring detailed risk management and review processes to obtain approvals. If we develop or use AI systems governed by these laws or regulations, we will need to apply significant resources to design, develop, test and maintain such systems in accordance with applicable law and regulation, with the potential for significant enforcement or litigation in the event of any perceived non-compliance. 

Our vendors may in turn incorporate AI tools into their offerings, and the providers of these AI tools may not meet existing or rapidly evolving regulatory or industry standards, including with respect to privacy and data security. Further, bad actors around the world use increasingly sophisticated methods, including the use of AI, to engage in illegal activities involving the theft and misuse of personal information, confidential information and intellectual property. Any of these effects could damage our reputation, result in the loss of valuable property and information, cause us to breach applicable laws and regulations, and adversely impact our business. 

Our internal computer systems, or those used by our third-party research institution collaborators, CROs or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches. 

Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our CROs and other contractors, vendors, and consultants may be vulnerable to damage from cybersecurity risks, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to and to harm sensitive or confidential information and networks, insider threats, and ransomware. These vulnerabilities may be heightened as a result of flexible work arrangements, including hybrid or remote work policies implemented by us and our third-party contractors, that were first adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and have continued by many businesses in an effort to attract and retain talent. 

Like other companies in our industry, we, and our third party vendors, have from time to time experienced, and will continue to experience in the future, cyberattacks on our information technology systems, including malware and computer virus attacks, despite our best efforts to prevent them. Although such incidents have been immaterial to our business to date, investigations into and remedial efforts in connection with any security incidents, even those with immaterial impact, can be costly and time-consuming, and any future incidents could be material, or cause significant disruption, to our business. Our technologies, systems, networks, or other proprietary information, and those of our vendors, suppliers and other business partners, may become the target of cyberattacks or data 

&#160; 

&#160; 

breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, or destruction of proprietary and other information, or could otherwise lead to the disruption of our business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed, ongoing or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on third parties for research and development, the manufacture and supply of drug product and drug substance and to conduct clinical trials. We depend on these third parties to implement adequate controls and safeguards to protect against and report cybersecurity incidents. If they fail to do so, we may suffer financial and other harm, including to our information, operations, performance, and reputation. To the extent that any cybersecurity incident or data breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or systems, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we may have an obligation to provide legal notifications and disclosures, and we could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed. 

We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure, including mobile technologies, to operate our business. Cybersecurity threats, both on premises and in the cloud, are evolving and could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, damage to our reputation, or financial loss. Such threats include, but are not limited to: malicious software, destructive malware, ransomware attacks, denial-of-service attacks, business email compromises, viruses, wrongful intrusions, social engineering (including phishing attacks), attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems or data, data breaches, the unauthorized release of confidential, personal or otherwise protected information, data corruption, the breakdown or damage or interruption of networks or systems from, among other things, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, and harm to individuals. In addition, we could be impacted by cybersecurity threats or other disruptions or vulnerabilities found in products or services we use that are provided to us by third-parties. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyberattacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, cyber criminals, hacktivists, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. The techniques used by criminal elements to attack computer systems are sophisticated, change frequently and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world. As a result, we may not be able to address these techniques proactively or implement adequate preventative measures. These events, if not prevented or effectively mitigated, could damage our reputation, require remedial actions and lead to loss of business, regulatory actions, potential liability and other financial losses. 

Certain data breaches must also be reported to affected individuals and various government and/or regulatory agencies, and in some cases to the media, under provisions of HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, other U.S. federal and state law, and requirements of non-U.S. jurisdictions, including the European Union Data Protection Directive, and financial penalties may also apply. 

Our contracts may not contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that limitations of liability in our contracts are sufficient to protect us from liabilities, damages, or claims related to our privacy and data security obligations. Further, although we maintain cyber liability insurance, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities related to any experienced cybersecurity incident or data breach. In addition, such insurance may not be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Further, our insurance may not cover all claims made against us and defending a suit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management&#8217;s attention. 

Inadequate funding for the FDA, the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other government agencies, including from government shut downs, or other disruptions to these agencies&#8217; operations, could hinder their ability to hire, retain or deploy personnel, and substantial leadership, personnel, and policy changes or otherwise, could prevent new products from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business. 

The ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result of these factors. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies, including substantial leadership, personnel and policy changes, may also slow the time necessary for new product candidates to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. In addition, government funding of the SEC and other government agencies on which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities, is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. 

Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new product candidates to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and the SEC, have had to furlough critical FDA, SEC and other government employees and stop critical activities. Currently, federal agencies in the U.S. are operating 

&#160; 

&#160; 

under a continuing resolution that is set to expire on March 14, 2025. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, disruptions at the NIH or changes to the NIH&#8217;s budget may negatively impact our operations and ongoing clinical trials. Further, future government shutdowns could impact our ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our operations. 

Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock 

Our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance. 

The market price of shares of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and could be subject to wide fluctuations in the future as a result of many risks listed in this section, and other risks beyond our control, including: 

&#8226; the timing of the initiation of, and progress in, our current and planned clinical trials and preclinical studies; 

&#8226; the results of our clinical trials and preclinical studies, and the results of clinical trials and preclinical studies by others for product candidates or indications similar to ours; 

&#8226; developments related to the FDA or to regulations applicable to cellular immunotherapies generally or our product candidates in particular including, but not limited to, regulatory pathways and clinical trial requirements for approvals; 

&#8226; announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments, such as our announcement in January 2023 of the termination of our collaboration with Janssen; 

&#8226; developments related to proprietary rights including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies; 

&#8226; additions or departures of key management or scientific personnel; 

&#8226; actual or anticipated changes in our research and development activities and our business prospects, including in relation to our competitors; 

&#8226; developments of technological innovations or new therapeutic products by us or others in the field of immunotherapy; 

&#8226; announcements or expectations of additional equity or debt financing efforts; 

&#8226; sales of our common stock by us or by our insiders or our other stockholders; 

&#8226; share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares; 

&#8226; comments by securities analysts; 

&#8226; fluctuations in our operating results (including changes related to stock-based compensation from performance-based awards); 

&#8226; acts of war or periods of widespread civil unrest, including the increasingly volatile global economic conditions resulting from the ongoing global geopolitical tensions, including wars and other armed conflicts; and 

&#8226; general economic and market conditions, including inflationary pressures and stock market volatility. 

These and other market and industry factors, including the effects of any future public health crises or other public health concerns, wars or other armed conflicts, changes in the regulatory landscape and governmental agency personnel in the United States or similar events resulting from the change in the U.S. presidential administration, and global economic conditions, may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially regardless of our actual operating performance, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. 

Changes in our stock price may also trigger financial obligations under our licensing arrangements. For example, pursuant to the terms of the Amended MSKCC License, MSKCC is eligible to receive from us certain milestone payments totaling up to $75.0 million based on the price of our common stock, where the amount of such payments owed to MSKCC is contingent upon certain increases in the price of our common stock following the date of achievement of a specified clinical milestone. In July 2021, we achieved the specified clinical milestone for a licensed product under the Amended MSKCC License and our ten-trading day trailing average common stock price exceeded the first, pre-specified threshold. Accordingly, MSKCC received the first milestone payment of 

&#160; 

&#160; 

$20.0 million in November 2021; however, uncertainty of the price of our common stock results in an inability to ascertain the precise timing of any remaining future milestone payments in advance. 

Additionally, a decrease in our stock price may cause our common stock to no longer satisfy the continued listing standards of Nasdaq. If we are not able to maintain the requirements for listing on Nasdaq, our common stock could be delisted, which could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to raise additional funds as well as the price and liquidity of our common stock. 

Our principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and may be able to exercise significant control over our company. 

As of February 25, 2025, our executive officers, directors and entities affiliated with our five percent stockholders beneficially own, in the aggregate, shares representing approximately 42.9% of our outstanding voting stock. If, in accordance with the CoD (as such term is defined in Note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements herewith) relating to the Class A Convertible Preferred Stock, Redmile (as such term is defined in Note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements herewith) elects to remove certain limitations on the percentage of our outstanding common stock that it may own such that the 2,755,086 shares of Class A Convertible Preferred Stock currently held by Redmile become fully convertible at Redmile&#8217;s option into 13,775,430 shares of common stock, the beneficial ownership of our executive officers, directors and entities affiliated with our five percent stockholders would increase to 46.7%. Although we are not aware of any voting arrangements in place among these stockholders, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, as a result of their stock ownership, they would be able to influence our management and affairs and control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company that our other stockholders may believe are in their best interests, or adversely affecting the liquidity, volatility, and market price of our common stock. For example, if any of our directors, executive officers or other entities affiliated with our five percent stockholders elect to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of a significant amount of shares of our common stock, this could result in a decrease in our stock price. Furthermore, any transferees or successors of all or a significant portion of our existing stockholders&#8217; ownership in us will be able to exert a similar amount of control over us through their ownership position. 

We may sell additional equity or debt securities or enter into other arrangements to fund our operations, which may result in dilution to our stockholders and impose restrictions or limitations on our business. Issuances of common stock or rights to purchase common stock under our equity incentive plans could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall. 

We expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations, and we may seek additional funding through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, state or government grants, strategic alliances, licensing and collaboration arrangements, or other third-party business arrangements. These financing activities may have an adverse effect on our stockholders&#8217; rights, the market price of our common stock and on our operations and may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies, intellectual property or product candidates, issue additional equity or debt securities, or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us. Further, in November 2023, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 pursuant to which we were initially eligible to issue and sell up to $300.0 million in common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and/or units, in one or more series or classes, including up to $100.0 million in shares of common stock that may be issued in sales deemed to be an &#8220;at the market offering&#8221; as defined by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). In March 2024, we issued and sold 14,545,454 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $5.50 per share in an underwritten offering pursuant to the shelf registration statement for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $80.0 million. Accordingly, we are currently eligible to issue an aggregate of approximately $220.0 million under the shelf registration statement (including the $100.0 million issuable in &#8220;at the market offerings&#8221;). Any sale or issuance of securities pursuant to a registration statement or otherwise may result in dilution to our stockholders and may cause the market price of our stock to decline, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders. In addition, any debt financings that we may enter into in the future may subject us to unfavorable repayment terms, including increased interest rates, impose restrictive covenants or otherwise adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders, and any additional equity financings will be dilutive to our stockholders. Furthermore, additional equity or debt financing might not be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all. 

Pursuant to our 2022 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (as amended and restated, the &#8220;2022 Plan&#8221;) we are authorized to grant stock options and other equity-based awards to our employees, officers, directors and consultants. The 2022 Plan authorizes the issuance of up to 17.5 million shares. We also make equity grants to new employees joining our company pursuant to an inducement plan, and our board of directors may elect to increase the number of shares available for future grants under the inducement plan without stockholder approval. If our board of directors elects in the future to increase the number of shares available for future grant 

&#160; 

&#160; 

and, in the case of the 2022 Plan, if our stockholders approve of any such future increase, our stockholders may experience additional dilution, and our stock price may fall. 

A significant portion of our total outstanding shares may be sold into the market in the near future, which could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly. 

Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. A significant portion of our outstanding shares of common stock are held by a small number of stockholders, including our directors, officers and significant stockholders. Sales by our stockholders of a substantial number of shares, or the expectation that such sales may occur, could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock. 

For example, we registered all of the 5,250,000 shares of common stock issued by us in our August 2016 private placement transaction for resale on a Form S-3, which was declared effective by the SEC in September 2016. We also registered all of the 6,766,915 shares of common stock issued by us and all 14,097,745 shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of an aggregate of 2,819,549 shares of Class A Convertible Preferred Stock issued by us in our November 2016 private placement transaction for resale on a Form S-3, which was declared effective by the SEC in January 2017. Additionally, we have registered the shares of common stock issued to Johnson &#38; Johnson Innovation &#8211; JJDC, Inc. under the stock purchase agreement entered into in June 2020 in connection with the Janssen Agreement pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3. Moreover, we registered all of the 5,380,117 shares of common stock issued by us and all of the 257,310 prefunded warrants to purchase common stock in our public offering in January 2021. We registered all of the 14,545,454 shares of common stock issued by us in our underwritten offering in March 2024. In addition, we registered for resale all of the 3,636,364 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the pre-funded warrants sold in the concurrent private placement in March 2024. 

We have also registered or intend to register all shares of our common stock subject to options, restricted stock units or other equity awards issued or reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans. As a result, these shares will be available for sale in the public market subject to vesting arrangements and exercise of options, and restrictions under applicable securities laws. In addition, certain of our executive officers, directors, employees and affiliates have established and may in the future establish programmed selling plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), for the purpose of effecting sales of our common stock. If any of these events cause a large number of our shares to be sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock and impede our ability to raise future capital. 

Provisions of Delaware law or our charter documents could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company, and could make it more difficult for you to change management. 

Provisions of Delaware law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, and our amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions may also prevent or delay attempts by stockholders to replace or remove our current management or members of our board of directors. These provisions include: 

&#8226; a classified board of directors with limitations on the removal of directors; 

&#8226; advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations; 

&#8226; the inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings; 

&#8226; the ability of our board of directors to make, alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws; and 

&#8226; the authority of our board of directors to issue preferred stock with such terms as our board of directors may determine. 

In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us. Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or discouraging a potential acquisition proposal or tender offer could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to achieve liquidity for their shares of our common stock, even if the acquisition proposal or tender offer is at a premium over the then-current market price for our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our amended and restated bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the U.S. federal district courts as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders&#8217; ability to litigate disputes with us in a different judicial forum. 

Pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty or other wrongdoing by any of our directors, officers, or employees to us or our stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision will not apply to any causes of action arising under the Securities Act. Unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternate forum, the U.S. federal district courts shall be the sole and exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. The forum selection clause in our amended and restated bylaws may limit our stockholders&#8217; ability to litigate disputes with us in a different judicial forum. While the Delaware courts have determined that these types of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we may incur significant additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions. 

A sustained decline in our stock price may result in an impairment indication which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 

Any significant change in market conditions, including a sustained decline in our stock price, that indicate a reduction in carrying value may give rise to indicators of impairment in the period that the change becomes known. For example, as of December 31, 2024, we identified an indicator of impairment of our long-lived assets due to a sustained decline in the trading price of our common stock over the preceding year, resulting in the our market capitalization being below its net asset value. As a result of the fair value analysis, we recorded a $13.4 million impairment charge against property and equipment and a $1.3 million impairment charge against the right-of-use asset in the statement of operations during the year ended December 31, 2024. 

We currently qualify as a &#8220;smaller reporting company&#8221; and a &#8220;non-accelerated filer,&#8221; and any decision on our part to comply only with certain reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to such companies could make our common shares less attractive to investors. 

As a result of our public float (the market value of our common shares held by non-affiliates) as of June 30, 2024, we qualify as a &#8220;smaller reporting company,&#8221; as defined under the Exchange Act. In addition, we are a &#8220;non-accelerated filer&#8221; as defined under the Exchange Act. For as long as we continue to be a smaller reporting company or a non-accelerated filer, we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies or non-accelerated filers, as applicable, including, but not limited to, an exemption from the requirement that our independent registered public accounting firm attest to the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 

If we choose to rely on any of these reporting and disclosure exemptions, the information we provide stockholders will be different than the information that is available with respect to many other public companies. Moreover, if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure or have an independent review and attestation of our internal control over financial reporting, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the market price of our common stock may be more volatile. 

Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax benefits may be limited and, as a result, our future tax liability may increase. 

As of December 31, 2024, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $689.2 million and $644.2 million, respectively, some of which begin to expire in various amounts in 2027 and 2028, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, we also had federal and California research and development tax credit carryforwards of $45.6 million and $37.8 million, respectively. The federal research and development tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2035 unless previously utilized, while the California carryforwards will carry forward indefinitely. These net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. In addition, in general, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, a corporation that undergoes an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses (NOLs) or tax credits, or NOLs or credits, to offset future taxable income or taxes. Generally, a change of more 

&#160; 

&#160; 

than 50 percentage points in the ownership of a corporation&#8217;s stock, by value, over a three-year period constitutes an ownership change for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We have determined that we triggered an ownership change limitation in November 2009 and again in May 2015. We have determined that we do not believe there were any ownership changes from May 2015 through December 2024. We have not analyzed periods subsequent to December 2024. We may experience additional ownership changes as a result of shifts in our stock ownership in the future. Limits on our ability to use our pre-change NOLs or credits to offset U.S. federal taxable income could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us if we earn net taxable income in the future. The amount of NOLs generated in taxable periods beginning after December 31, 2024, that we are permitted to deduct in any taxable year is limited to 80% of our taxable income in such year, where taxable income is determined without regard to the NOL deduction itself. U.S. federal and certain state NOLs generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 are not subject to expiration. 

General Risk Factors 

We are and could be further subject to securities class action litigation and other types of stockholder litigation. 

The stock market in general, and the Nasdaq Global Market and biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of a company&#8217;s securities. For example, in January 2023, a purported stockholder filed a lawsuit against us and certain of our officers captioned Hadian v. Fate Therapeutics, Inc. et al. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California and two derivative actions were filed in the same court in June 2023 and June 2024, respectively (see &#8220;Item 3. Legal Proceedings&#8221; for a more detailed description of this matter). We could also be subject to other types of litigation, which may involve claims of breach of fiduciary duties by our directors or officers for misuse/mismanagement of company assets/resources or conflicts of interest. Any such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management&#8217;s attention and resources, which would harm our business, operating results, or financial condition. Additionally, the dramatic increase in the cost of directors&#8217; and officers&#8217; liability insurance may cause us to opt for lower overall policy limits or to forgo insurance that we may otherwise rely on to cover significant defense costs, settlements, and damages awarded to plaintiffs. 

Our business operations may subject us to disputes, claims and lawsuits, which may be costly and time-consuming and could materially and adversely impact our financial position and results of operations. 

From time to time, we may become involved in disputes, claims and lawsuits relating to our business operations. For example, we have in the past and we may, from time to time, face or initiate claims related to intellectual property matters, employment matters, or commercial disputes. Any dispute, claim or lawsuit may divert management&#8217;s attention away from our business, we may incur significant expenses in addressing or defending any dispute, claim or lawsuit, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial results. Litigation related to these disputes may be costly and time-consuming and could materially and adversely impact our financial position and results of operations if resolved against us. In addition, the uncertainty associated with litigation could lead to increased volatility in our stock price. 

Unfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Our ability to invest in and expand our business and meet our financial obligations, to attract and retain third-party contractors and collaboration partners and to raise additional capital depends on our operating and financial performance, which, in turn, is subject to numerous factors, including the prevailing economic and political conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors beyond our control, such as the rate of unemployment, rate of inflation, the number of uninsured persons in the United States, political influences and inflationary pressures, and fluctuations in costs, particularly due to changes in labor costs and material costs. For example, an overall decrease in or loss of insurance coverage among individuals in the United States due to high levels of unemployment, underemployment or the repeal of certain provisions of the ACA may decrease the demand for healthcare services and pharmaceuticals. If fewer patients are seeking medical care because they do not have insurance coverage or are unable to obtain medical care for their conditions due to resource constraints on the healthcare system, we may experience difficulties in any eventual commercialization of our product candidates and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to manage cost fluctuations and inflationary pressures, including prices of materials, costs of labor, it may adversely impact our operating performance, expenses and results. 

In addition, our results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets upon which pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies such as us are dependent for sources of capital. In the past, global financial crises have caused extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. A severe or prolonged 

&#160; 

&#160; 

economic downturn, ongoing and emerging global geopolitical tensions, including wars or other armed conflicts, interest rate fluctuations, rising inflation rates or recession, could result in a variety of risks to our business, including a reduced ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all, and weakened demand for our product candidates. A weak or declining economy, and rising inflation could also strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which ongoing wars and other armed conflicts, current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business. 

Significant political, trade, regulatory developments, and other circumstances beyond our control, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 

We intend to expand our clinical operations to countries other than the U.S., and are developing products for regulatory approval and sale in countries throughout the world. Significant political, trade, or regulatory developments in the jurisdictions in which we may conduct clinical trials, develop, or sell our products, such as those stemming from the change in U.S. federal administration, are difficult to predict and may have a material adverse effect on us. Similarly, changes in U.S. federal policy that affect the geopolitical landscape could give rise to circumstances outside our control that could have negative impacts on our business operations. For example, on February 1, 2025, the U.S. imposed a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, which were subsequently suspended for a period of one month, and a 10% additional tariff on imports from China. Historically, tariffs have led to increased trade and political tensions. In response to tariffs, other countries have implemented retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. Political tensions as a result of trade policies could reduce trade volume, investment, technological exchange and other economic activities between major international economies, resulting in a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets. Any changes in political, trade, regulatory, and economic conditions, including U.S. trade policies, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 

Volatility in capital markets and lower market prices for our securities may affect our ability to access new capital through sales of shares of our common stock or issuance of indebtedness, which may harm our liquidity, limit our ability to grow our business, pursue acquisitions or improve our operating infrastructure and restrict our ability to compete in our markets. 

Our operations consume substantial amounts of cash, and we intend to continue to make significant investments to support our business growth, respond to business challenges or opportunities, develop new product candidates, retain or expand our current levels of personnel, improve our existing products, enhance our operating infrastructure, and potentially acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Our future capital requirements may be significantly different from our current estimates and will depend on many factors, including the need to: 

&#8226; finance unanticipated working capital requirements; 

&#8226; continue the research and development or our existing product candidates and develop or enhance our technological infrastructure; 

&#8226; pursue acquisitions, in-licenses or other strategic relationships; and 

&#8226; respond to competitive pressures. 

Accordingly, we may need to pursue equity or debt financings to meet our capital needs. With uncertainty in the capital markets and other factors, such financing may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, we could face significant limitations on our ability to invest in our operations and otherwise suffer harm to our business. 

Recent volatility in interest rates could affect our ability to obtain working capital through borrowings such as bank credit lines and public or private sales of debt securities, which may result in lower liquidity, reduced working capital and other adverse impacts on our business. 

To meet our liquidity needs, we have previously relied, in part, on borrowed funds, and may do so again in the future. Continued volatility in interest rates will impact the cost of new indebtedness and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from governments and third-parties relating to environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies and practices may cause us to incur additional costs, expose us to additional risks or impact our reputation. 

In recent years, there has been increasing public focus and scrutiny from certain investors, employees and other stakeholders concerning corporate responsibility, specifically related to ESG factors. In addition to the changing rules and regulations related to ESG matters imposed by governmental and self-regulatory organizations, a variety of third-party organizations, institutional investors and customers evaluate the performance of companies on ESG topics, and the results of these assessments are widely publicized. These changing rules, regulations and stakeholder expectations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and increased management time and attention spent complying with or meeting such regulations and expectations. Reduced access to or increased cost of capital may occur as financial institutions and investors increase expectations related to ESG matters. Third-party providers of ESG ratings and reports on companies have increased in number, resulting in varied and, in some cases, inconsistent standards and frameworks. Topics taken into account in such assessments include, among others, our efforts and impacts with respect to climate change and the role of our board of directors in supervising various sustainability issues. 

Developing and acting on initiatives within the scope of ESG, and collecting, measuring and reporting ESG-related information and metrics can be costly, difficult and time consuming and is subject to evolving reporting standards. We may also communicate certain initiatives and goals, regarding environmental matters, diversity, social investments and other ESG-related matters, in our SEC filings or in other public disclosures. These initiatives and goals within the scope of ESG could be difficult and expensive to implement, the technologies needed to implement them may not be cost effective and may not advance at a sufficient pace, and we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy or completeness of the disclosure. Furthermore, statements about our ESG-related initiatives and goals, and progress against those goals, may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope or nature of such initiatives or goals, or for any revisions to these goals. If our ESG-related data, processes and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail to achieve progress with respect to our goals, including our previously announced commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, within the scope of ESG on a timely basis, or at all, our reputation, business, financial performance and growth could be adversely affected. In addition, in recent years &#8220;anti-ESG&#8221; sentiment has gained momentum across the U.S., with several states and Congress having proposed or enacted &#8220;anti-ESG&#8221; policies, legislation, or initiatives or issued related legal opinions, and the President having recently issued an executive order opposing diversity equity and inclusion (&#8220;DEI&#8221;) initiatives in the private sector. Such anti-ESG and anti-DEI-related policies, legislation, initiatives, litigation, legal opinions, and scrutiny could result in the Company facing additional compliance obligations, becoming the subject of investigations and enforcement actions, or sustaining reputational harm. 

If our business practices do not meet evolving investor, government agency or other stakeholder expectations and standards with respect to ESG, then our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees and the market price of our securities could be negatively impacted. New governmental regulations could result in new directives and new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and disclosures which may lead to increased expenditures for sustainability initiatives, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline. 

Adverse developments affecting the financial services industry, such as actual events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults, or non-performance by financial institutions or transactional counterparties, could adversely affect our current and projected business operations and its financial condition and results of operations. 

Actual events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional counterparties or other companies in the financial services industry or the financial services industry generally, or concerns or rumors about any events of these kinds or other similar risks, have in the past and may in the future lead to market-wide liquidity problems. For example, on March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) was closed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, which appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as receiver. Similarly, on March 12, 2023, Signature Bank and Silvergate Capital Corp. were each swept into receivership. In these cases borrowers under credit agreements, letters of credit and certain other financial instruments with SVB, Signature Bank or any other financial institution that is placed into receivership by the FDIC may be unable to access undrawn amounts thereunder. We currently use deposit accounts to fund our operations and other financial instruments such as cash-collateralized letters of credit associated with our facilities leases. Our excess cash is invested according to a restrictive investment policy within custodial accounts at various financial institutions. If any of the financial institutions that hold our deposit accounts were to be placed into receivership, we may be unable to access the funds in those accounts, which could result in liquidity constraints or failures. In addition, if any of our collaboration partners, suppliers or other parties with whom we conduct business are unable to access funds pursuant to such instruments or lending arrangements with such a financial institution, such parties&#8217; ability to pay their obligations to us or to enter into 

&#160; 

&#160; 

new commercial arrangements requiring additional payments to us could be adversely affected. In this regard, counterparties to SVB credit agreements and arrangements, and third parties such as beneficiaries of letters of credit (among others), may experience direct impacts from the closure of SVB, or the sale of its assets, and uncertainty remains over liquidity concerns in the broader financial services industry. Similar impacts have occurred in the past, such as during the 2008-2010 financial crisis. 

Inflation and rapid increases in interest rates have led to a decline in the trading value of previously issued government securities. Although the U.S. Department of Treasury, FDIC and Federal Reserve Board have announced a program to provide up to $25 billion of loans to financial institutions secured by certain of such government securities held by financial institutions to mitigate the risk of potential losses on the sale of such instruments, widespread demands for customer withdrawals or other liquidity needs of financial institutions for immediately liquidity may exceed the capacity of such program. Additionally, there is no guarantee that the U.S. Department of Treasury, FDIC and Federal Reserve Board will provide access to uninsured funds in the future in the event of the closure of other banks or financial institutions, or that they would do so in a timely fashion. 

Although we assess our banking and other business relationships as we believe necessary or appropriate, our access to funding sources and other credit arrangements in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our current and projected future business operations could be significantly impaired by factors that affect us, the financial institutions with which we have credit agreements or arrangements directly, or the financial services industry or economy in general. These factors could include, among others, events such as liquidity constraints or failures, the ability to perform obligations under various types of financial, credit or liquidity agreements or arrangements, disruptions or instability in the financial services industry or financial markets or concerns or negative expectations about the prospects for companies in the financial services industry. These factors could involve financial institutions with which we have financial or business relationships but could also include factors involving financial markets or the financial services industry generally. 

The results of events or concerns that involve one or more of these factors could include a variety of material and adverse impacts on our current and projected business operations and our financial condition and results of operations. These could include, but may not be limited to, the following: 

&#8226; Delayed access to deposits or other financial assets or the uninsured loss of deposits or other financial assets; or 

&#8226; Delayed or lost access to, or reductions in borrowings available under working capital sources and/or delays, inability or reductions in our ability to refund, roll over or extend the maturity of, or enter into new working capital resources. 

In addition, investor concerns regarding the U.S. or international financial systems could result in less favorable commercial financing terms, including higher interest rates or costs and tighter financial and operating covenants, or systemic limitations on access to credit and liquidity sources, thereby making it more difficult for us to acquire financing on acceptable terms or at all. Any decline in available funding or access to our cash and liquidity resources could, among other risks, adversely impact our ability to meet our operating expenses, financial obligations or fulfill our other obligations, result in breaches of our financial and/or contractual obligations or result in violations of federal or state wage and hour laws. 

Any of these impacts, or any other impacts resulting from the factors described above or other related or similar factors not described above, could have material adverse impacts on our liquidity and our current and/or projected business operations and financial condition and results of operations. 

In addition, any further deterioration in the macroeconomic economy or financial services industry could lead to losses or defaults by our collaboration partners, suppliers or other parties with whom we do business, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our current and/or projected business operations and results of operations and financial condition. Any bankruptcy or insolvency of a collaboration partner, supplier or other party with whom we do business, or the failure of any such party to make payments when due, or any breach or default by any such party, or the loss of any significant commercial relationships, could result in material losses to us and may have a material adverse impact on our business. 

Geopolitical risks associated with ongoing wars and armed conflicts could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our clinical trials. 

There are ongoing and emerging geopolitical tensions, including wars and other armed conflicts, and although the conflicts have had little direct impact on our business to date, the uncertainty and ripple effects created by these conflicts may have unknown indirect impacts. For instance, the ongoing conflicts have resulted in significant volatility in certain equity, debt and currency markets, material increases in certain commodity prices, and economic uncertainty. Global conflicts, including Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East, and heightened tensions in the Pacific region, have significantly elevated global geopolitical tensions and security concerns. It is not possible to predict the broader or longer-term consequences of these conflicts, although a prolonged conflict may 

&#160; 

&#160; 

result in adverse effects on microeconomic conditions including inflation; disruptions to our global technology infrastructure, including through cyberattack, ransom attack, or cybersecurity-intrusion; adverse changes in international trade policies and relations; disruptions in global supply chains; our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations; and constraints, volatility, or disruption in the capital markets, any of which could negatively impact our business, financial performance and financial condition. Economic sanctions imposed by the United States, Canada, EU, and other countries in response to the ongoing conflicts and the potential response to such sanctions may also have an adverse impact our business, including our clinical trials and supply chain, the financial markets and the global economy. 

We continue to monitor any adverse impact that the outbreak of war and the subsequent institution of sanctions by the United States and other countries may have on the global economy in general, on our business and operations and on the businesses and operations of our suppliers and third parties with whom we conduct business. 

We or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by earthquakes, wildfires, power outages, or other natural disasters, including public health crises, and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster. 

Our facilities are located in San Diego, California, which is a seismically active region, and has also historically been subject to wildfires and electrical blackouts. Earthquakes, wildfires, power outages, or other natural disasters (including due to the effects of climate change or any public health crises) could severely disrupt our operations, or the operations of third parties upon whom we depend, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. If a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as our manufacturing facilities or those of our CMOs, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. For example, clinical supplies of our NK and T-cell therapeutic product candidates, as well as the working and master cell banks from which these product candidates are manufactured, are maintained in freezers at our manufacturing facility and at third-party biorepositories. If these materials are damaged at our facility or at the facilities of our third-party repositories, including as a result of a power outage or natural disaster, clinical supply of our product candidates may be impacted and our clinical trials may be delayed. Further, any measures taken by governmental authorities or businesses in response to any public health crisis, such as quarantines, stay-at-home orders or travel restrictions, could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, prospects or results of operations by restricting our ability to conduct our clinical trials and research and development activities, and limiting our and our third-party manufacturers&#8217; ability to manufacture product and forcing temporary closure of our facilities and facilities that we rely upon. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we and our third-party biorepositories have in place currently may be limited and may not prove adequate for protecting and continuing our business in the event that our business is disrupted as a result of a public health crisis or other serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any insurance we maintain against such risks may not be adequate to cover losses in any particular case. 

If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired. 

As a public company, we are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), and the related rules and regulations of the SEC, expanded disclosure requirements, accelerated reporting requirements and more complex accounting rules. Company responsibilities required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act include establishing and maintaining corporate oversight and adequate internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud. 

We cannot assure that we will not have material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to successfully remediate any material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, or identify any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies that may exist, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports in addition to applicable stock exchange listing requirements, and our stock price may decline materially as a result. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

If we fail to comply with environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including regulations governing the handling, storage or disposal of hazardous materials, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business. 

We are subject to numerous environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous materials, including chemicals, biological materials and infectious agents. Our operations also may produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We will not be able to eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from any use by us of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. 

Although we maintain workers&#8217; compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological or hazardous materials. 

In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development, or production efforts. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions. 

Changes in tax law may adversely affect us or our investors. 

The rules dealing with U.S. federal, state and local income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the U.S. Treasury Department. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect us or holders of our common stock. In recent years, many such changes have been made and changes are likely to continue to occur in the future. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted in 2017 and made significant changes to corporate taxation, including the reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, the limitation of the tax deduction for net interest expense to 30% of adjusted taxable income (except for certain small businesses), the limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and the elimination of net operating loss carrybacks (though any such net operating losses may be carried forward indefinitely), and the modification or repeal of many business deductions and credits. In addition, under Section 174 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021, expenses that are incurred for research and development in the U.S. will be capitalized and amortized, which may have an adverse effect on our cash flow. It cannot be predicted whether, when, in what form, or with what effective dates, tax laws, regulations and rulings may be enacted, promulgated or issued, which could result in an increase in our or our stockholders&#8217; tax liability or require changes in the manner in which we operate in order to minimize or mitigate any adverse effects of changes in tax law.

Investors should consider carefully the following risk factors that could cause our business, operating results and financial condition to be materially adversely affected. We routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be materially different than we presently anticipate. New risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our business or financial performance. The categories of risk we have identified in "" Item 1A. Risk Factors"" include risks associated with our operations, governmental regulation and laws, our indebtedness and financial condition. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other detailed information concerning IPALCO and AES Indiana set forth in the Notes to the Financial Statements and in &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K herein. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. 

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR OPERATIONS 

Our electric generating facilities are subject to operational risks that at times result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and/or maintenance expenses, increased fuel or power purchased costs and other liabilities, and these liabilities could become significant for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. 

We operate generating facilities, including those using coal, oil, natural gas, and renewable energy, which involve certain risks that can adversely affect energy costs, output and efficiency levels. These risks include: 

&#8226; unit or facility shutdowns due to a breakdown or failure of equipment or processes; 

&#8226; increased prices for fuel and fuel transportation as existing contracts expire or as such contracts are adjusted through price re-opener provisions or automatic adjustments; 

&#8226; disruptions in the availability or delivery of fuel and lack of adequate inventories; 

&#8226; shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment; 

&#8226; loss of cost-effective disposal options for solid waste generated by the facilities; 

&#8226; accidents and injuries; 

&#8226; reliability of our suppliers; 

&#8226; inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements; 

&#8226; operational restrictions resulting from environmental or permit limitations or governmental interventions; 

&#8226; construction delays and cost overruns; 

&#8226; disruptions in the delivery of electricity; 

&#8226; labor disputes or work stoppages by employees; 

&#8226; the availability of qualified personnel; 

&#8226; events occurring on third party systems that interconnect to and affect our system; 

&#8226; operator error; and 

&#8226; catastrophic events. 

We experience unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and/or maintenance expenses, increased capital expenditures and/or increased fuel and power purchased costs from time to time, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. These risks are partially mitigated by our ability to generally pass fuel and power purchased costs through to customers through the FAC. If unexpected plant outages occur frequently and/or for extended periods of time, this could result in adverse regulatory action that may have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

Additionally, as a result of the above risks and other potential hazards associated with the power generation industry, we may from time to time become exposed to significant liabilities for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. Power generation involves hazardous activities, including acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating large pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems. The control and management of these risks depend upon adequate development and training of personnel and on the existence of operational procedures, preventative maintenance plans and specific programs supported by quality control systems which reduce, but do not eliminate, the possibility of the occurrence and impact of these risks. 

The hazardous activities described above can also cause personal injury or loss of life, damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment, contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. The occurrence of any one of these events results in us from time to time being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for damages, environmental cleanup costs, personal injury and fines and/or penalties. We maintain an amount of insurance protection that we believe is adequate, but there can be no assurance that our insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. A successful claim that is significant for which we are not fully insured could adversely and materially affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, except for our large substations, transmission and distribution assets are not covered by insurance and are considered to be outside the scope of property insurance. Further, due to rising insurance costs and changes in the insurance markets, we cannot provide assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available on terms similar to those presently available to us or at all. Any such losses not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

We may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or a decline in the number of customers or in customer usage. 

Customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside our control, such as energy efficiency and DSM measures, population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity. A significant lack of growth, or a decline, in the number of customers in our service territory or in customer demand for electricity could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and may cause us to fail to fully realize anticipated benefits from investments and expenditures. 

The cost of fuel and other commodities have experienced and could continue to experience volatility and we may not be able to hedge the entire exposure of our operations from availability and price volatility. In addition, until our coal units are converted or retired, a portion of our electricity is generated by coal. 

Our business is sensitive to changes in the price of natural gas, coal, power purchased and emissions allowances. In addition, changes in the prices of steel, copper and other raw materials can have a significant impact on our costs. We also are dependent on power purchased, in part, to meet our seasonal planning reserve margins. Any changes in fuel prices could affect the prices we charge, our operating costs and our competitive position with respect to our products and services. The cost of fuel and other commodities has been volatile in recent years and we expect that volatility to continue. 

Our exposure to fluctuations in the price of fuel is limited because, pursuant to Indiana law, we apply to the IURC for a change in our FAC every three months to recover our estimated fuel costs, which may be above or below the levels included in our basic rates and charges. In addition, we apply to recover the energy portion of our power purchased costs in these quarterly FAC proceedings subject to a benchmark (please see Note 2, &#8220;Regulatory Matters &#8211; FAC and Authorized Annual Jurisdictional Net Operating Income&#8221; to the Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details regarding the benchmark and the process to recover fuel costs). As part of this cost-recovery process, we must present evidence in each proceeding that we have made every reasonable effort to acquire fuel and generate or purchase power or both so as to provide electricity to our retail customers at the lowest fuel cost reasonably possible. If we are unable to timely or fully recover our fuel and power purchased costs, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

Approximately 23% of the energy we produced in 2024 was generated by coal as compared to approximately 36% and 58% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. While we have approximately 86% of our forecasted coal requirements for 2025 currently in inventory or secured under contract for delivery in 2025 as of the date of this report, the balance is yet to be purchased and will be purchased under a combination of short-term contracts and the spot market. Prices can be highly volatile in both the short-term market and on the spot market. The coal market has experienced price volatility in the last several years. We are now in a global market for coal in which our domestic price is increasingly affected by international supply disruptions and demand balance. Coal exports from the U.S. have increased significantly at times in recent years. In addition, domestic developments such as government-imposed direct costs and permitting issues affect mining costs and supply availability. Moreover, the variable demand of retail customer load and the performance of our generation fleet have an impact on our fuel procurement operations over the remaining period of coal generation in our portfolio. 

As our coal usage is scheduled to end by June 2026 with the conversion of our last two coal fired units to natural gas, our exposure is shifting to natural gas to meet customer demand for electricity. Our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by unexpected price volatility in the gas market. Our dependence on natural gas also means that the output of our natural gas-fired generation units can be greatly affected by the costs of other facilities that compete with our natural-gas generation units, in particular renewable energy resources. The continued addition of renewable energy facilities to the MISO grid increases the uncertainty forecasting run hours for our existing and future natural gas fired facilities. 

While coal supply is largely procured via long term contracts with a degree of price certainty, natural gas is procured on a shorter term basis and balanced with consumption on a daily basis. In order to bring additional price certainty and enhance reliability of delivery the Company procures quantities of firm transportation on relevant pipelines and has an IURC approved structured natural gas hedging plan to offset the impact of price fluctuations. 

Catastrophic events could adversely affect our facilities, systems and operations. 

Catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, cyber-attacks, terrorist acts, acts of war, acts of sabotage or vandalism, pandemic events, or natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, severe winds, ice or snowstorms, droughts or other similar occurrences could adversely affect our generation facilities, transmission and distribution systems, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our Petersburg Plant, which is our largest source of generating capacity, as well as certain of our existing and proposed renewable energy projects, are located in the Wabash Valley seismic zone, adjacent to the New Madrid seismic zone, which are both areas of significant seismic activity in the central U.S. 

Our business is sensitive to weather and seasonal variations. 

Weather conditions significantly affect the demand for electric power, and accordingly, our business is affected by variations in general weather conditions and unusually severe weather. As a result of these factors, our operating revenue and associated operating expenses are not generated evenly by month during the year. We forecast electric sales on the basis of normal weather, which represents a long-term historical average. Significant variations from normal weather (such as warmer winters and cooler summers) could have a material impact on our revenue, operating income and net income and cash flows. In addition, severe or unusual weather, such as floods, tornadoes and ice or snowstorms, may cause outages and property damage that may require us to incur additional costs that may not be insured or recoverable from customers. While we are permitted to seek recovery of certain severe storm damage costs, if we are unable to fully recover such costs in a timely manner, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

Our membership in a RTO presents risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

We are a member of MISO, a FERC-regulated RTO. MISO serves the electrical transmission needs of a 15-state area including much of the Mid-U.S. and Canada and maintains functional operational control over our electric transmission facilities, as well as that of the other utility members of MISO. We retain control over our distribution facilities. As a result of membership in MISO and its operational control, our continued ability to import power, when necessary, and export power to the wholesale market has been, and may continue to be, impacted. We offer our generation and bid our load into this market on a day-ahead basis and settle differences in real time. Given the nature of MISO&#8217;s policies regarding use of transmission facilities, and its administration of the energy and ancillary services markets, it is difficult to predict near-term operational impacts. We cannot assure MISO&#8217;s reliable operation of the regional transmission system, or the impact of its operation of the energy and ancillary services markets. 

The rules governing the various regional power markets may also change from time to time which could affect our costs and revenue and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We may expand or otherwise change our transmission system according to decisions made by MISO in addition to our internal planning process. In addition, various proposals and proceedings before the FERC relating to MISO or otherwise may cause transmission rates to change from time to time. We also incur fees and costs to participate in MISO. 

To the extent that we rely, at least in part, on the performance of MISO to maintain the reliability of our transmission system, it puts us at some risk for the performance of MISO. In addition, actions taken by MISO to secure the reliable operation of the entire transmission system operated by MISO could result in voltage reductions, rolling 

blackouts, or sustained system-wide blackouts on AES Indiana&#8217;s transmission and distribution system, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See also &#8220;Item 1. Business - MISO Operations"" and &#8220;Item 1. Business - Regulation &#8211; Retail Ratemaking.&#8221; 

Our transmission and distribution system is subject to operational, reliability and capacity risks. 

The ongoing reliable performance of our transmission and distribution system is subject to risks due to, among other things, weather damage, intentional or unintentional damage, equipment or process failure, catastrophic events, such as fires and/or explosions, facility outages, labor disputes, accidents or injuries, operator error, or inoperability of key infrastructure internal or external to us and events occurring on third party systems that interconnect to and affect our system. The failure of our transmission and distribution system to fully operate and deliver the energy demanded by customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and if such failures occur frequently and/or for extended periods of time, could result in adverse regulatory action. In addition, the advent and quick adaptation of new products and services that require increased levels of electrical energy cannot be predicted and could result in insufficient transmission and distribution system capacity timely enough to accommodate the potential increased demand. As with all utilities, potential concern with the adequacy of transmission capacity on AES Indiana&#8217;s system or the regional systems operated by MISO could result in MISO, the NERC, the FERC or the IURC requiring us to upgrade or expand our transmission system through additional capital expenditures or share in the costs of regional expansion. Also, as a result of the above risks and other potential risks and hazards associated with transmission and distribution operations, we may from time to time become exposed to significant liabilities for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. Except for AES Indiana&#8217;s large substations, transmission and distribution assets are not covered by insurance and are considered to be outside the scope of property insurance. Otherwise, we maintain an amount of insurance protection that we believe is adequate, but there can be no assurance that our insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. Further, any increased costs or adverse changes in the insurance markets may cause delays or inability in maintaining insurance coverage on terms similar to those presently available to us or at all. A successful claim for which we are not fully insured could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

Current and future conditions in the economy may adversely affect our customers, suppliers and other counterparties in a way which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

Our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows have been and will continue to be affected by general economic conditions. Slowing economic growth, credit market conditions, fluctuating consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices, and other challenges affecting the general economy, have caused and may continue to cause some of our customers to experience deterioration of their businesses, cash flow shortages, and difficulty obtaining financing. As a result, existing customers may reduce their electricity consumption and may not be able to fulfill their payment obligations to us in the normal, timely fashion. In addition, some existing commercial and industrial customers may discontinue their operations. Sustained downturns, recessions or a sluggish economy generally affect the markets in which we operate and negatively influence our energy operations. A contracting, slow or sluggish economy could reduce the demand for energy in areas in which we are doing business. For example, during economic downturns, our commercial and industrial customers may see a decrease in demand for their products, which in turn may lead to a decrease in the amount of energy they require. Furthermore, projects which may result in potential new customers may be delayed until economic conditions improve. Some of our suppliers, customers and other counterparties, and others with whom we transact business experience financial difficulties, which may impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us. For example, our counterparties on forward purchase contracts and financial institutions involved in our credit facility may become unable to fulfill their contractual obligations to us or result in their declaring bankruptcy or similar insolvency-like proceedings. We may not be able to enter into replacement agreements on terms as favorable as our existing agreements. Reduced demand for our electric services, failure by our customers to timely remit full payment owed to us and supply delays or unavailability could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In particular, the projected economic growth and total employment in Indianapolis are important to the realization of our forecasts for annual energy sales. 

Economic conditions relating to the asset performance and interest rates of the Pension Plans could materially and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

Pension costs are based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, level of employer contributions, the expected life span of pension plan beneficiaries and the discount rate used to determine the present value of future pension obligations. Any of these assumptions could prove to be wrong, resulting in a shortfall of our Pension Plans&#8217; assets compared to pension obligations under the Pension Plans. Further, the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the Pension Plans. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below our projected return rates. A decline in the market value of the Pension Plans&#8217; assets will increase the funding requirements under the Pension Plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in value in the foreseeable future. Future pension funding requirements, and the timing of funding payments, may also be subject to changes in legislation. We are responsible for funding any shortfall of our Pension Plans&#8217; assets compared to obligations under the Pension Plans, and a significant increase in our pension liabilities could materially and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We are subject to the Pension Protection Act of 2006, which requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding. As a result, our required contributions to these plans, at times, have increased and may increase in the future. In addition, our pension and postemployment benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. If interest rates decrease, the discounted liabilities increase benefit expense and funding requirements. Further, changes in demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions, may also increase the funding requirements for the obligations related to the pension and other postemployment benefit plans. Declines in market values and increased funding requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Please see Note 9, &#8220; Benefit Plans&#8221; to the Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. 

Counterparties providing materials or services may fail to perform their obligations, which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

We enter into transactions with and rely on many counterparties in connection with our business, including for the purchase and delivery of inventory, including fuel and equipment components, for our capital improvements and additions and to provide professional services, such as actuarial calculations, payroll processing and various consulting services. If any of these counterparties fails to perform its obligations to us or becomes unavailable, our business plans may be materially disrupted, we may be forced to discontinue or delay certain operations if a cost-effective alternative is not readily available or we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements at then-current market prices that may exceed our contractual prices and cause delays. Although our agreements are designed to mitigate the consequences of a potential default by the counterparty, our actual exposure may be greater than the relief provided by these mitigation provisions. Any of the foregoing could result in regulatory actions, cost overruns, delays or other losses, any of which (or a combination of which) could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

Further, our construction program calls for extensive expenditures for capital improvements and additions, including the installation of environmental upgrades, additions and improvements to and replacements of generation, transmission and distribution facilities, as well as other initiatives. As a result, we have engaged, and will continue to engage, numerous contractors and have entered into a number of agreements to acquire the necessary materials and/or obtain the required construction related services. In addition, some contracts provide for us to assume the risk of price escalation and availability of certain metals and key components. This could force us to enter into alternative arrangements at then-current market prices that may exceed our contractual prices or cause construction delays in a significant manner. It could also subject us to enforcement action by regulatory authorities to the extent that such a contractor failure resulted in a failure by AES Indiana to comply with requirements or expectations, particularly with regard to the cost of the project. As a result of these events, we might incur losses or delays in completing construction. 

Highly infectious or contagious disease outbreaks could impact our business and operations. 

Regional or global outbreaks of infectious or contagious diseases, such as COVID-19 or another pandemic could have material and adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows due to, among other factors: 

&#8226; decline in customer demand as a result of general decline in business activity; 

&#8226; destabilization of the markets and decline in business activity negatively impacting our customer growth or the number of customers in our service territory as well as our customers&#8217; ability to pay for our services when due (or at all); 

&#8226; delay or inability in obtaining regulatory actions and outcomes that could be material to our business, including for recovery of COVID-19 related expenses and losses, such as uncollectible customer amounts, and the review and approval of our applications, rates and charges by the IURC; 

&#8226; difficulty accessing the capital and credit markets on favorable terms, or at all, a disruption and instability in the global financial markets, or deteriorations in credit and financing conditions which could affect our access to capital necessary to fund business operations or address maturing liabilities on a timely basis; 

&#8226; negative impacts on the health of our essential personnel, especially if a significant number of them are affected, and on our operations as a result of implementing stay-at-home, quarantine and other social distancing measures; 

&#8226; a deterioration in our ability to ensure business continuity during a disruption, including increased cybersecurity attacks related to a work-from-home environment; 

&#8226; delays or inability to access, transport and deliver fuel or other materials to our facilities due to restrictions on business operations or other factors affecting us and our third-party suppliers; 

&#8226; the inability to hedge sufficient exposure of our operations from availability and cost of fuel and other commodities that experience significant volatility; 

&#8226; delays or inability to access equipment or the availability of personnel to perform planned and unplanned maintenance, which can, in turn, lead to disruption in operations; 

&#8226; delays or inability in achieving our financial goals, growth strategy and digital transformation; and 

&#8226; delays in the implementation of expected rules and regulations. 

Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects. 

Failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements, the disallowance of cost recovery, or incorrect payment processing. 

Our internal controls, accounting policies and practices and internal information systems are designed to enable us to capture and process transactions and information in a timely and accurate manner in compliance with GAAP, laws and regulations, taxation requirements and federal securities laws and regulations in order to, among other things, disclose and report financial and other information in connection with the recovery of our costs and with our reporting requirements under federal securities, tax and other laws and regulations and to properly process payments. We have also implemented corporate governance, internal control and accounting policies and procedures in connection with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our internal controls and policies have been and continue to be closely monitored by management and our Board of Directors. While we believe these controls, policies, practices and systems are adequate to verify data integrity, the identification of significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls that we cannot remediate in a timely manner could lead to undetected errors that could result in material misstatements in our financial statements, the disallowance of cost recovery, or incorrect payment processing. The consequences of these events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

If we are unable to maintain a qualified and properly motivated workforce, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

One of the challenges we face is to retain a skilled, efficient and cost-effective workforce while recruiting new talent to replace losses in knowledge and skills due to resignations, terminations or retirements. This undertaking could require us to make additional financial commitments and incur increased costs. If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, we have employee compensation plans that reward the 

performance of our employees. We seek to ensure that our compensation plans encourage acceptable levels for risk and high performance through pay mix, performance metrics and timing. We also have policies and procedures in place to mitigate potential excessive risk-taking by employees to achieve performance targets which could result in events that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

We are subject to collective bargaining agreements that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

We are subject to collective bargaining agreements with employees who are members of a union. Approximately 68% of our employees are represented by a union in two bargaining units: a physical unit and a clerical-technical unit. While we believe that we maintain a satisfactory relationship with our employees, it is possible that labor disruptions affecting some or all of our operations could occur during the period of the collective bargaining agreements or at the expiration of the collective bargaining agreements before new agreements are negotiated. We may not be able to successfully train new personnel as current workers with significant knowledge and expertise retire. We also may be unable to staff our business with qualified personnel in the event of significant absenteeism related to a pandemic illness. Work stoppages by, or poor relations or ineffective negotiations with, our employees or other workforce issues could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

The use of non-derivative and derivative instruments in the normal course of business could result in losses that could materially and adversely impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 

We sometimes use non-derivative and derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, to manage commodity and financial risks. We may at times enter into forward contracts to hedge the risk of volatility in earnings from wholesale marketing activities. These trades are affected by a range of factors, including variations in power demand, fluctuations in market prices, market prices for alternative commodities and optimization opportunities. We have attempted to manage our commodities price risk exposure by establishing and enforcing risk limits and risk management policies. Despite our efforts, however, these risk limits and management policies may not work as planned and fluctuating prices and other events could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these instruments can involve management&#8217;s judgment or the use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of some of these contracts. We could also recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts, a counterparty failing to perform, or the underlying transactions which the instruments are intended to hedge failing to materialize, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

Cyber attacks and data security breaches could harm our business. 

Our business relies on electronic systems and network technologies to operate our generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure. We also use various financial, accounting and other infrastructure systems. We also store and use customer, employee, and other personal information and other confidential and sensitive information. Our infrastructure may be targeted by nation states, hacktivists, criminals, insiders or terrorist groups. In particular, there has been an increased focus on the U.S. energy grid believed to be related to the Russia/Ukraine conflict. Such an attack, by hacking, malware or other means, may interrupt our operations, cause property damage, affect our ability to control our infrastructure assets, cause the release of sensitive customer information or limit communications with third parties. Any loss or corruption of confidential or proprietary data through a breach of our systems or certain of our third party vendor systems may: 

&#8226; impact our operations, revenue, strategic objectives, customer and vendor relationships; expose us to negative publicity, legal claims, regulatory investigations and proceedings and associated penalties or liabilities; 

&#8226; require extensive repair and restoration costs for additional security measures to avert future attacks; 

&#8226; impair our reputation and limit our competitiveness for future opportunities; and 

&#8226; impact our financial and accounting systems and, subsequently, our ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. 

We have implemented measures to help prevent unauthorized access to our systems and facilities, including certain measures to comply with mandatory regulatory reliability standards. 

To date, cyber breaches have not had a material impact on our operations or financial results. We continue to assess potential threats and vulnerabilities and make investments to address them, including global monitoring of networks and systems, identifying and implementing new technology, improving user awareness through employee security training, and updating our security policies as well as those for third-party providers. 

We cannot guarantee the extent to which our security measures will prevent future cyber attacks and security breaches or that our insurance coverage will adequately cover any losses we may experience. 

Please see "" Item 1C. Cybersecurity "" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. 

Failure or disruption in our information systems or those of businesses we rely on, or implementation of new processes and information systems could, if significant, interrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in a material manner. 

Our business depends on numerous information systems to manage our operations and business processes, financial information, and customer billings. From time to time, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, damage or disruptions in our information technology and computer systems from various risks including, but not limited to, power outages, facility damage, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, vandalism, theft, natural disasters, catastrophic events, human error and potential cyber threats. Our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. 

In addition, we are currently making, and expect to continue to make, investments in our information technology systems and infrastructure, some of which are significant. In 2023, we implemented certain replacement information systems, including our customer information and billing system. Failure to manage the ongoing implementations associated with this initiative, including with respect to our systems for billing and collecting from our customers could continue to have adverse impacts on our business, operating results and financial condition. 

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION AND LAWS 

We may not always be able to recover our costs to deliver electricity to our retail customers. The costs we can recover and the return on capital we are permitted to earn for certain aspects of our business are regulated and governed by the laws of Indiana and the rules, policies and procedures of the IURC. 

We are currently obligated to supply electric energy to retail customers in our service territory. Even though rate regulation is premised on full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that the IURC will agree that all of our costs have been prudently incurred or are recoverable. There also is no assurance that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that will produce a full or timely recovery of our costs and authorized return. From time to time, the demand for electric energy required to meet our service obligations could exceed our available electric generating capacity. When our retail customer demand exceeds our generating capacity for units operating under MISO economic dispatch, recovery of our cost to purchase electric energy in the MISO market to meet that demand is subject to a stipulation and settlement agreement. The agreement includes a benchmark which compares hourly power purchased costs to daily natural gas prices. Power purchased costs above the benchmark must meet certain criteria in order for us to fully recover them from our retail customers, such as consideration of the capacity of units available but not selected by the MISO economic dispatch. We may not always have the ability to pass all of the power purchased costs on to our customers, and even if we are able to do so, there may be a significant delay between the time the costs are incurred and the time the costs are recovered. Since these situations most often occur during periods of peak demand, the market price for electric energy at the time we purchase it could be very high, and we may not be allowed to recover all of such costs through our FAC (please see Note 2, "" Regulatory Matters - FAC and Authorized Annual Jurisdictional Net Operating Income "" to the Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details regarding the benchmark and the process to recover power purchased costs). Even if a supply shortage were brief, we could suffer substantial losses that could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

Changes in, or reinterpretations of, the laws, rules, policies and procedures that set electric rates, permitted rates of return, changes in AES Indiana&#8217;s rate structure, regulations regarding ownership of generation assets and electric 

service, the supply or generation, reliability initiatives, fuel and power purchased (which account for a substantial portion of our operating costs), capital expenditures and investments and the recovery of these and other costs on a full or timely basis through rates, power market prices and changes to the frequency and timing of rate increases could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

Concerns about GHG &#160; emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change have led to increased regulation and other actions that could impact our business. 

One byproduct of burning coal and other fossil fuels is the emission of GHGs, including CO 2 . At the federal, state and regional levels, policies are under development or have been developed to regulate GHG emissions. In 2024, AES Indiana emitted approximately 9 million tons of C O 2 from our power plants. AES Indiana uses CO 2 emission estimation methodologies supported by &#8220;Th e Greenhouse Gas Protocol&#8221; reporting standard on GHG emissions. Our CO 2 emissions are determined from emissions monitoring data and calculations using actual fuel heat inputs and fuel type CO 2 emission factors. 

There currently is no U.S. federal legislation imposing mandatory GHG emission reductions (including for CO 2 ) that affects our electric power generation facilities. Following prior versions of CO 2 emissions regulations promulgated by EPA, on May 9, 2024, EPA published the final NSPS requiring carbon capture and sequestration for new and reconstructed baseload stationary combustion turbines, among other requirements. Also on May 9, 2024, EPA published the final rule regulating GHGs from existing EGUs pursuant to Section 111(d) of the CAA. 

In December 2015, the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change convened for the 21st Conference of the parties and the resulting Paris Agreement established a long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature well below 2&#176;C above pre-industrial levels. The international community has gathered and continues to gather annually for Conference to the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. We anticipate that the Agreement will continue the trend toward efforts to de-carbonize the global economy. The U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement became effective on November 4, 2020. On January 20, 2021, President Biden signed and submitted an instrument for the U.S. to rejoin the Paris Agreement, which became effective on February 19, 2021. On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued an Executive Order titled &#8220;Putting America First in International Environmental Agreements&#8221; directing the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations to formally withdraw from the Paris Agreement. 

Any existing or future international, federal, state or regional legislation or regulation of GHG emissions could have a material adverse impact on our financial performance. The actual impact on our financial performance will depend on a number of factors, including among others, the degree and timing of GHG emissions reductions required under any such legislation or regulations, of offsets, the extent to which market-based compliance options are available, if such options were available, the extent to which we would be entitled to receive GHG emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an auction or on the open market as well as the cost or availability of such allowances and the impact of such legislation or regulation on our ability to recover costs incurred through rate increases or otherwise. Our cost of compliance could be substantial. Although we would seek recovery of costs associated with new climate change or GHG regulations, our inability to fully or timely recover such costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, concerns over GHG emissions and their effect on the environment have led, and could lead further, to reduced demand for coal-fired power, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

Furthermore, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, physical risks from climate change could include, but are not limited to, increased runoff and earlier spring peak discharge in many glacier and snow-fed rivers, warming of lakes and rivers, an increase in sea level, changes and variability in precipitation and in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. Physical impacts may have the potential to significantly affect our business and operations. For example, extreme weather events could result in increased downtime and operation and maintenance costs at our electric power generation facilities and our support facilities. Variations in weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity, would also be expected to affect the energy needs of customers. A decrease in energy consumption could decrease our revenue. In addition, while revenue would be expected to increase if the energy consumption of customers increased, such increase could prompt the need for additional investment in generation capacity. Changes in the temperature of lakes and rivers and changes in precipitation that result in drought could adversely affect the operations of our fossil-fuel fired electric power generation facilities. 

If any of the foregoing risks materialize, we expect our costs to increase or revenue to decrease and there could be a material adverse effect on our business and on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and reputation if such changes are significant. Please see &#8220;Item 1. Business - Environmental Matters&#8221; for additional information of environmental matters impacting us, including those relating to regulation of GHG emissions. 

We are subject to numerous environmental laws, rules and regulations that require capital expenditures, increase our cost of operations, may expose us to environmental liabilities or make continued operation of certain generating units unprofitable. 

We are subject to various federal, state, regional and local environmental protection and health and safety laws, rules and regulations governing, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use, disposal and transportation of regulated materials, including CCR; the use and discharge of water used in generation boilers and for cooling purposes; the emission and discharge of hazardous and other materials into the environment; and the health and safety of our employees. Such laws, rules and regulations can become stricter over time, and we could also become subject to additional environmental laws, rules and regulations and other requirements in the future. Environmental laws, rules and regulations also generally require us to comply with inspections and obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, and other governmental authorizations. These laws and regulations often require a lengthy and complex process of obtaining and renewing licenses, permits and other governmental authorizations from federal, state and local agencies. If we are not able to timely comply with inspections and obtain, maintain or comply with all environmental laws, rules and regulations, and all licenses, permits, and other government authorizations required to operate our business, then our operations could be prevented, delayed or subject to additional costs. A violation of environmental laws, rules, regulations, permits or other requirements can result in substantial fines, penalties, other sanctions, permit revocation, facility shutdowns, the imposition of stricter environmental standards and controls or other injunctive measures affecting operating assets. Compliance with these laws, regulations and other requirements requires us to expend significant funds and resources and could at some point become prohibitively expensive or result in our shutting down (temporarily or permanently) or altering the operation of our facilities. Under certain environmental laws, we could also be held responsible for costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites. We could also be held strictly, jointly and severally liable for investigation or remediation of such contamination, human exposure to hazardous substances or for other environmental damage. From time to time, we are subject to enforcement and litigation actions for claims of noncompliance with environmental laws, rules and regulations or other environmental requirements. We cannot assure that we will be successful in defending against any claim of noncompliance. Any actual or alleged violation of environmental laws, rules, regulations and other requirements also may require us to expend significant resources to defend against any such alleged violations and expose us to unexpected costs. Our costs and liabilities relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

In addition, we are subject to potentially significant remediation expenses, enforcement initiatives, private party lawsuits and reputational risk associated with CCR, which consists of bottom ash, fly ash, and air pollution control wastes generated at our current and former coal-fired generation plant sites . We expect to incur substantial costs to comply with CCR rules and requirements and any changes to existing CCR rules or requirements or other new rules or requirements addressing CCR may require us to incur additional costs. Also, we may become subject to CCR-related lawsuits or involved in other CCR-related litigation from time to time that may require us to incur other costs or expose us to unexpected liabilities, which could be significant. In addition, CCR and its production at our facilities have been the subject of interest from environmental non-governmental organizations and the media. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. While we maintain insurance for certain of these costs and liabilities, there can be no assurance that our insurance will be available, sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all of our claimed liabilities. 

Please see &#8220;Item 1. Business - Environmental Matters&#8221; for additional information of environmental matters impacting us, including our current CCR-related insurance coverage litigation. 

If we were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, we could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates. 

As an owner and operator of a bulk power transmission system, AES Indiana is subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the NERC and enforced by the FERC. The standards are based on the functions that 

need to be performed to ensure the bulk power system operates reliably and is guided by reliability and market interface principles. Compliance with reliability standards may subject us to higher operating costs or increased capital expenditures. Although we expect to recover costs and expenditures from customers through regulated rates, there can be no assurance that the IURC will approve full recovery in a timely manner. If we were found not to be in compliance with the mandatory reliability standards, we could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, which likely would not be recoverable from customers through regulated rates and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

We are subject to extensive laws and local, state and federal regulation, as well as litigation and other proceedings that affect our operations and costs. 

We are subject to extensive regulation at the federal, state and local levels. For example, at the federal level, AES Indiana, as an electric utility, is regulated by the FERC and the NERC and, at the state level, we are regulated by the IURC. The regulatory power of the IURC over AES Indiana is both comprehensive and typical of the traditional form of regulation generally imposed by state public utility commissions. We face the risk of unexpected or adverse regulatory action. Regulatory discretion is reasonably broad in Indiana. AES Indiana is subject to regulation by the IURC as to our services and facilities, the valuation of property, the construction, purchase, or lease of electric generating facilities, the classification of accounts, rates of depreciation, the increase or decrease in retail rates and charges, the issuance of securities and long-term debt, the acquisition and sale of some public utility properties or securities and certain other matters. 

AES Indiana&#8217;s tariff rates for electric service to retail customers consist of basic rates and charges which are set and approved by the IURC after public hearings. In addition, AES Indiana&#8217;s rates typically include various adjustment mechanisms and we must seek approval from the IURC through such public proceedings of our rate adjustment mechanism factors to reflect changes in certain costs. There can be no assurance that we will be granted approval of rate adjustment mechanism factors that we request from the IURC. The failure to obtain IURC approval of requested relief, or any other adverse rate determination by the IURC could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

As a result of the EPAct and subsequent legislation affecting the electric utility industry, we have been required to comply with rules and regulations in areas including mandatory reliability standards, cybersecurity, transmission expansion and energy efficiency. We are currently unable to predict the long-term impact, if any, to our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows as a result of these rules and regulations. Complying with the regulatory environment to which we are subject requires us to expend a significant amount of funds and resources. The failure to comply with this regulatory environment could subject us to substantial financial costs and penalties and changes, either forced or voluntary, in the way we operate our business. 

Independent of the IURC&#8217;s ability to review basic rates and charges, Indiana law requires electric utilities under the jurisdiction of the IURC to meet operating expense and income test requirements as a condition for approval of requested changes in the FAC. Additionally, the fuel charge applied for can be reduced if a utility&#8217;s rolling twelve-month operating income, determined at quarterly measurement dates, exceeds a utility&#8217;s authorized annual jurisdictional net operating income and there are not sufficient applicable cumulative net operating income deficiencies against which the excess rolling twelve-month jurisdictional net operating income can be offset. 

Future events, including the advent of retail competition within AES Indiana&#8217;s service territory, could result in the deregulation of part of AES Indiana&#8217;s existing regulated business. In addition to effects on our business that could result from any deregulation, such as a loss of customers and increased costs to retain or attract customers upon deregulation, adjustments to AES Indiana&#8217;s accounting records may be required to eliminate the historical impact of regulatory accounting. Such adjustments, as required by FASB ASC 980 &#8220;Regulated Operations,&#8221; could eliminate the effects of any actions of regulators that have been recognized as assets and liabilities. Required adjustments could include the expensing of any unamortized net regulatory assets, the elimination of certain tax liabilities, and a write down of any impaired utility plant balances. We expect AES Indiana to meet the criteria for the application of ASC 980 for the foreseeable future. 

We are subject to litigation, regulatory proceedings, administrative proceedings, audits, settlements, investigations and claims from time to time that require us to expend significant funds to address. There can be no assurance that the outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Asbestos and other regulated substances are, and may continue to be, present at our facilities, and we have been named as a defendant in asbestos litigation. The continued presence of asbestos and 

other regulated substances at these facilities could result in additional litigation being brought against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Please see Note 2, &#8220;Regulatory Matters&#8221; and &#160; Note 11, &#8220;Commitments and Contingencies&#8221; to the Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of significant regulatory matters and legal proceedings involving us. 

Tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 

We are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and local governments. From time to time, legislative measures may be enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax positions regarding income or other taxes. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these legislative measures. In addition, U.S. federal, state and local tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will be sustained if challenged by relevant tax authorities and if not sustained, there could be a material impact on our results of operations. 

RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 

We rely on access to the financial markets. General economic conditions and disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all, and cause increases in our interest expense. 

From time to time, we rely on access to the capital and credit markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows. These capital and credit markets experience volatility and disruption from time to time and the ability of corporations to raise capital can be negatively impacted. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets make it harder and more expensive to raise capital. Our ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all can be adversely affected by unfavorable market conditions or declines in our creditworthiness, and we may be unable to access adequate funding to refinance our debt as it becomes due or finance capital expenditures. The extent of any impact will depend on several factors, including our operating cash flows, financial condition and prospects, the overall supply and demand in the credit markets, our credit ratings, credit capacity, the cost of financing, the financial condition, performance and prospects of other companies in our industry or with similar financial circumstances and other general economic and business conditions. It may also depend on the performance of credit counterparties and financial institutions with which we do business. Access to funds under our existing financing arrangements is also dependent on the ability of our counterparties to meet their financing commitments and our satisfying conditions to borrowing. Our inability to obtain financing on reasonable terms, or at all, with creditworthy counterparties could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. If our available funding is limited or we are forced to fund our operations at a higher cost, these conditions may require us to curtail our business activities and increase our cost of funding, both of which would adversely impact our profitability. 

See Note 7, &#8220;Debt &#8221; to the Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding indebtedness. See also &#8220;Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk&#8221; for information related to market risks. 

The level of our indebtedness, and the security provided for this indebtedness, could adversely affect our financial flexibility. 

As of December 31, 2024, we had on a consolidated basis $4,182.4 million of indebtedness, including finance lease obligations, and total shareholders&#8217; equity of $1,284.5 million. AES Indiana had $2,763.8 million of first mortgage bonds outstanding as of December 31, 2024, which are secured by the pledge of substantially all of the assets of AES Indiana under the terms of AES Indiana&#8217;s mortgage and deed of trust. This level of indebtedness and related security has important consequences, including the following: 

&#8226; increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; 

&#8226; requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund other corporate purposes; 

&#8226; limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and 

&#8226; limiting, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, our ability to borrow additional funds, as needed. 

We expect to incur additional debt in the future, subject to the terms of our debt agreements and regulatory approvals for any AES Indiana debt. To the extent we become more leveraged, the risks described above would increase. Further, actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Accordingly, our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay at maturity all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due and, in that event, we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to refinance our debt as it becomes due. For a further discussion of outstanding debt, see &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; and Note 7, &#8220; Debt &#8221; to the Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We have variable rate debt that bears interest based on a prevailing rate that is reset based on a market index that can be affected by market demand, supply, market interest rates and other market conditions. We also maintain both cash on deposit and investments in cash equivalents from time to time that could be impacted by interest rate fluctuations. As such, any event which impacts market interest rates could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, ratings agencies issue credit ratings on us and our debt that affect our borrowing costs under our financial arrangements and affect our potential pool of investors and funding sources. Our credit ratings also govern the collateral provisions of certain of our contracts. If rating agencies downgrade our credit ratings, our borrowing costs would likely further increase, our potential pool of investors and funding resources could be reduced, and we could be required to post additional cash collateral under selected contracts. These events would likely reduce our liquidity and profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

IPALCO is a holding company and parent of AES Indiana and other subsidiaries. IPALCO&#8217;s cash flow is dependent on operating cash flows of AES Indiana and its ability to pay cash to IPALCO. 

IPALCO is a holding company with no material assets other than the common stock of its subsidiaries, and accordingly all cash is generated by the operating activities of our subsidiaries, principally AES Indiana. As such, IPALCO&#8217;s cash flow is largely dependent on the operating cash flows of AES Indiana and its ability to pay cash to IPALCO. AES Indiana&#8217;s mortgage and deed of trust, its amended articles of incorporation, its Credit Agreement and its $400 million Term Loan Agreement contain restrictions on AES Indiana&#8217;s ability to issue certain securities or pay cash dividends to IPALCO. For example, there are restrictions that require maintenance of a leverage ratio which could limit the ability of AES Indiana to pay dividends. See &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources and Liquidity&#8221; for a discussion of these restrictions. See Note 7, &#8220;Debt&#8221; to the Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding indebtedness. In addition, AES Indiana is regulated by the IURC, which possesses broad oversight powers to ensure that the needs of utility customers are being met. The IURC could impose additional restrictions on the ability of AES Indiana to distribute, loan or advance cash to IPALCO pursuant to these broad powers. While we do not expect any of the foregoing restrictions to significantly affect AES Indiana&#8217;s ability to pay funds to IPALCO in the future, a significant limitation on AES Indiana&#8217;s ability to pay dividends or loan or advance funds to IPALCO would have a material adverse effect on IPALCO&#8217;s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

Our ownership by AES subjects us to potential risks that are beyond our control. 

All of AES Indiana&#8217;s common stock is owned by IPALCO, all of whose common stock is owned by AES U.S. Investments (82.35%) and CDPQ (17.65%). Due to our relationship with AES, any adverse developments and announcements concerning AES may impair our ability to access the capital markets and to otherwise conduct business. In particular, downgrades in AES&#8217;s credit ratings could result in AES Indiana&#8217;s or IPALCO&#8217;s credit ratings being downgraded.

A description of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business is set forth below. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below, or of additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects. In such an event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. 

Risk Factor Summary 

This risk factor summary contains a high-level summary of risks associated with our business. It does not contain all of the information that may be important to you, and you should read this risk factor summary together with the more detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties set forth following this summary. A summary of our risks includes, but is not limited to, the following: 

&#8226; Adverse general economic, market and industry conditions and reductions in workforce identity and customer identity spending have, in the past, and may, in the future, reduce demand for our solutions, which could harm our revenue, results of operations and cash flows. 

&#8226; We have experienced rapid growth in prior periods, and any failure to effectively manage future growth could harm our business and future prospects. 

&#8226; If we fail to manage our growth effectively or fail to execute our business plan, we may not be able to maintain high levels of service and customer satisfaction or adequately address competitive challenges. 

&#8226; We face intense competition, especially from larger, well-established companies, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position. 

&#8226; We have a history of losses, and we may not be consistently profitable in the future. 

&#8226; Our business depends on our ability to retain existing customers, and our revenues and results of operations could be adversely impacted if they do not renew their subscriptions or purchase additional licenses or subscriptions with us. 

&#8226; If we are unable to grow our customer base, our revenue growth and profitability could be harmed. 

&#8226; We may experience quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations due to a number of factors that make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our results of operations to fall below analyst or investor expectations. 

&#8226; Interruptions or performance problems that impact the functionality of our technology, systems, or infrastructure could result in delays in the deployment of our platforms. 

&#8226; In the past, we have experienced cybersecurity incidents that allowed unauthorized access to our systems or data or our customers&#8217; data, harmed our reputation, created additional liability, and adversely impacted our financial results. We and our third-party service providers may experience similar incidents in the future which may also include disabling access to our service. 

&#8226; We and our third-party service providers have, in the past, failed or been perceived to have failed to fully comply with the privacy or security provisions of our privacy policy, our contracts and/or legal or regulatory requirements, which could result in proceedings, actions or penalties against us. We may experience similar incidents in the future. 

&#8226; If we are unable to ensure that our solutions integrate or interoperate with a variety of operating systems, platforms, services, software applications devices, mobile phones and other hardware form factors that are developed by others, our platforms may become less competitive and our results of operations may be harmed. 

&#8226; Real or perceived errors, failures, vulnerabilities or bugs in our solutions, including deployment complexity, have, in the past and could, in the future, harm our business and results of operations. 

&#8226; Because we generally recognize revenue from our subscriptions and support services over the term of the relevant service period, a decrease in sales during a reporting period may not be immediately reflected in our results of operations for that period. 

&#8226; The stock price of our Class A common stock may be volatile or may decline. 

&#8226; The dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our capital stock prior to the completion of our IPO, including our directors, executive officers, and their affiliates, who held in the aggregate 35.3% of the voting power of our capital stock as of January 31, 2025. This will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval. 

&#8226; Transactions relating to our convertible notes may affect the value of our Class A common stock. 

&#8226; We depend on our executive officers and other key employees, and the loss of one or more of these employees or an inability to attract and retain other highly skilled employees could harm our business. 

Risks Related to Our Business and Industry 

Adverse general economic, market and industry conditions and reductions in workforce identity and customer identity spending have, in the past, and may, in the future, reduce demand for our solutions, which could harm our revenue, results of operations and cash flows. 

Our revenue, results of operations and cash flows depend on the overall demand for our solutions. Concerns about the inflation and interest rate environment, the instability of financial institutions, health epidemics, the systemic impact of a widespread recession (in the United States or internationally), energy costs, geopolitical issues, such as Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, or the availability and cost of credit have and could continue to lead to increased market volatility, decreased consumer confidence and diminished growth expectations in the U.S. economy and abroad, which in turn could result in reductions in spending on our platforms by our existing and prospective customers. These economic conditions can occur abruptly. Prolonged economic slowdowns may result in customers requesting us to renegotiate existing contracts on less advantageous terms to us than those currently in place or defaulting on payments due on existing contracts or not renewing at the end of the contract term. For example, rising interest rates in the United States have affected businesses across many industries, including ours, by increasing the costs of labor, employee healthcare and other components, which may further constrain our, our customers&#8217; and prospective customers&#8217; budgets. To the extent there is a sustained general economic downturn, and our platforms and services are perceived by customers or potential customers as costly, or too difficult to deploy or migrate to, our revenue may be disproportionately affected by delays or reductions in spending. 

We have experienced rapid growth in prior periods, and any failure to effectively manage future growth could harm our business and future prospects. 

Our prior revenue growth rates may not be indicative of our future growth or performance. We have experienced revenue growth rates of 43%, 22% and 15% during fiscal 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively. Our revenue for any quarterly or annual period should not be relied upon as an indication of our future revenue or revenue growth for any future period, as we may not be able to sustain revenue growth consistent with recent history, or at all. Revenue growth depends on several factors, including pricing our platforms to attract new and retain existing customers; managing demand for our solutions; competing against larger companies and new market entrants; capitalizing on new acquisitions, technologies or growth opportunities; and other conditions described in these risk factors. If we are unable to grow our revenue, it will be difficult to maintain our profitability, or maintain or increase our cash flow on a consistent basis. We expect our operating expenses to increase in future periods as we continue to expand our business. If our revenue growth does not increase to offset these anticipated increases in our operating expenses, our business, financial position and results of operations will be harmed, and we may not be able to achieve or consistently maintain profitability. Additionally, the sales cycle for the evaluation and implementation of our platforms, which typically extends for multiple months for enterprise deals, may also cause us to experience a delay between increasing operating expenses and generating corresponding revenue, if any. We may not be able to prepare accurate internal financial forecasts or replace anticipated revenue that we lost as a result of such delays, and our results of operations in future reporting periods could differ materially from our 

estimates and forecasts, or may not meet the expectations of our investors, which could cause our business to suffer and our stock price to decline. 

If we fail to manage our growth effectively or fail to execute our business plan, we may not be able to maintain high levels of service and customer satisfaction or adequately address competitive challenges. 

We have experienced rapid growth and organizational change, which has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our management and our operational and financial resources. In order to manage future growth and better align our organizational structure and resources with our business priorities, we may undertake restructuring plans from time to time. For example, in recent years we have announced restructuring plans intended to reduce operating expenses and improve profitability that involved reductions of our workforce. We have in the past encountered, and may in the future encounter, challenges in the execution of these restructuring efforts, such as adverse impacts on employee morale or attrition beyond the intended reductions, and these challenges could impact our ability to execute on our business initiatives, which could cause our restructuring efforts to not be as effective as anticipated and harm our financial results. 

In addition, as we expand our business, it is important that we continue to maintain a high level of customer service and satisfaction. As our customer base continues to grow, we will need to expand our account management, customer service and other personnel, and our network of independent software vendors (&#8220;ISVs&#8221;), system integrators and other channel partners, to provide personalized account management and customer service. If we are not able to continue to provide high levels of customer service, our reputation, as well as our business, results of operations and financial condition, could be harmed. 

We face intense competition, especially from larger, well-established companies, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position. 

The markets for our solutions are rapidly evolving, highly competitive, and subject to shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new technologies. As the markets in which we operate continue to mature and new technologies and competitors enter such markets, we expect competition to intensify. We compete with both cloud-based and on-premise enterprise application software providers including, but not limited to: authentication providers; access and lifecycle management providers; multi-factor authentication providers; infrastructure-as-a-service providers; other customer identity and access management providers; and solutions developed in-house by our potential customers. Our principal competitor is Microsoft. 

Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing, distribution, customer support or other resources, larger intellectual property portfolios, longer operating histories, greater resources to make strategic acquisitions, more established relationships with third-party service providers, and greater name recognition than we do. They may also have a larger customer base, many of which may prefer to purchase from the same competitor rather than replace their existing infrastructure with our solutions. 

Some of our larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings, or greater resources to acquire new offerings or repurpose existing offerings to provide identity solutions with subscription models. As a result, they can leverage their relationships based on other solutions, or incorporate functionality into existing solutions, to gain business in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our solutions, including selling at zero or negative margins, bundling products or maintaining closed technology platforms. In addition, larger competitors, as well as new start-up companies that innovate, make significant investments in research and development and may invent similar or superior solutions that compete with our solutions. These competitive pressures or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions, fewer orders, reduced revenue and gross margins, increased net losses, and loss of market share, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

We have a history of losses, and we may not be consistently profitable in the future. 

While we achieved profitability in fiscal 2025, we have incurred net losses of $355 million and $815 million in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels in future periods in order to become consistently profitable, and even if we do, we may not be able to maintain or increase our level of profitability. We may incur losses in the future for a number of reasons, including the risks described in these risk factors, an increase in operating expense, and other unknown risks. Any failure by us to sustain profitability on a consistent basis could cause the value of our common stock to decline. 

Our business depends on our ability to retain existing customers, and our revenues and results of operations could be adversely impacted if they do not renew their subscriptions or purchase additional licenses or subscriptions with us. 

Our ability to increase and maintain revenue growth depends, in part, on our ability to retain and expand our commercial relationships with our existing customers. This requires that our existing customers continue to use our platforms, either by purchasing additional subscriptions or by renewing their subscriptions when existing contract terms expire. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions after the expiration of their subscription period. They may decide not to renew their subscriptions with a similar contract period, at the same prices and terms, or with the same or a greater number of users. In the past, some of our customers have elected not to renew their agreements with us, and it is difficult to accurately predict long-term customer retention and expansion rates. Customer retention and expansion has, in the past, and may, in the future, decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, such as customers&#8217; satisfaction with our solutions; our prices and pricing plans, including as compared to those of competing software solutions; unfavorable macroeconomic conditions; reductions in customer spending levels; negative sentiment stemming from cybersecurity incidents; customer utilization rates; new offerings; and changes to the packaging of our product offerings. If existing customers do not purchase additional subscriptions or renew their subscriptions, renew on less favorable terms or fail to add more users, our revenue may decline or grow less quickly than anticipated, which would harm our future results of operations. 

If we are unable to grow our customer base, our revenue growth and profitability could be harmed. 

We aim to increase our revenue and achieve and maintain profitability by growing our customer base, particularly through sales to larger organizations. As our market matures and product offerings evolve, we believe that competitors will introduce lower cost or differentiated solutions that compete, or are perceived to compete, with our solutions. If prospective customers view the cost or features of competitors&#8217; solutions as preferable to ours, or do not perceive our solutions to be of sufficiently high value and quality, we could fail to attract the number and types of new customers we are seeking. Prospective customers&#8217; decisions to purchase our solutions depends on a variety of other factors, including those specified under the risk factor titled &#8220; Our business depends on our ability to retain existing customers, and our revenues and results of operations could be adversely impacted if they do not renew their subscriptions or purchase additional licenses or subscriptions with us ,&#8221; and described elsewhere in these risk factors. Any failure to attract new customers could impede our success in selling new subscriptions and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We may experience quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations due to a number of factors that make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our results of operations to fall below analyst or investor expectations. 

Our results of operations fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including, but not limited to: 

&#8226; fluctuations in demand for, or pricing of, our platforms, including as a result of macroeconomic conditions or competition; 

&#8226; our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers or otherwise increase the use of our platforms; 

&#8226; the timing and success of introductions of new solutions by us or our competitors, or any other change in the competitive landscape of our market; 

&#8226; security breaches of, technical difficulties with, or interruptions to, the delivery and use of our solutions, and any negative market perception or customer reactions related to, or arising from the disclosure of, such breaches, difficulties or interruptions; 

&#8226; seasonal buying patterns for IT spending; 

&#8226; the mix of revenue attributable to larger transactions as opposed to smaller transactions, and the associated volatility and timing of our transactions; 

&#8226; changes in remaining performance obligations (&#8220;RPO&#8221;) due to seasonality, the timing of and compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, size and timing, new business linearity between quarters and within a quarter, average contract term or fluctuations due to foreign currency movements, all of which may impact implied growth rates; 

&#8226; errors in our forecasting of the demand for our solutions, which could lead to lower revenue, increased costs or both; 

&#8226; increases in and timing of sales and marketing and other operating expenses that we may incur to grow our brand, expand our operations and remain competitive; 

&#8226; our ability to comply with applicable laws and requirements, including data privacy and cybersecurity regimes; 

&#8226; costs related to the acquisition of businesses, talent, technologies or intellectual property, including potentially significant amortization costs and possible write-downs; 

&#8226; credit or other difficulties confronting our third-party service providers, including channel partners; 

&#8226; costs related to litigation, including adverse judgments, settlements and other disputes; 

&#8226; the impact of new accounting pronouncements and associated system implementations; 

&#8226; changes in the legislative or regulatory environment; 

&#8226; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; 

&#8226; expenses related to real estate, including our office leases, and other fixed expenses; and 

&#8226; general economic, market and industry conditions in domestic or international markets, including the inflation and interest rate environment, geopolitical uncertainty and instability. 

Any one or more of the factors above may result in significant fluctuations in our results of operations. You should not rely on our past results as an indicator of our future performance. 

The variability and unpredictability of our quarterly results of operations or other operating metrics could result in our failure to meet our expectations or those of analysts that cover us or investors with respect to revenue or other metrics for a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons, the market price of our Class A common stock could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits. 

Our ability to introduce new solutions is dependent on adequate research and development resources and, in part, on our ability to successfully complete acquisitions. If we do not adequately fund our research and development efforts or complete acquisitions successfully, we may not be able to compete effectively and our business and results of operations may be harmed. 

To remain competitive, we must continue to develop new solutions, applications and enhancements to our existing portfolio. This is particularly true as we further expand and diversify our capabilities. Maintaining adequate research and development resources, such as the appropriate personnel and development technology, to meet the demands of the market is essential. If we elect not to or are unable to develop solutions internally, we may choose to expand into a certain market or strategy via an acquisition for which we could potentially pay too much or fail to successfully integrate into our operations. Further, many of our competitors expend a considerably greater amount of funds on their respective research and development programs, and those that do not have, in some cases, been acquired by larger companies that allocate greater resources to our competitors&#8217; research and development programs. Our failure to maintain adequate research and development resources or to compete effectively with the research and development programs of our competitors would give an advantage to such competitors and may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Even if we maintain adequate research and development resources, we may be unable to monetize newly developed solutions or features such that we can recoup our research and development expenditures. For example, if we develop a new feature but our competitors give an equivalent feature away for free, we may need to also include our newly developed feature for free as part of an existing product offering to remain competitive in the marketplace. Such a loss of anticipated revenue to offset our research and development expenditures may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Future acquisitions, investments, partnerships or alliances could be difficult to identify and integrate, divert the attention of management personnel, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and harm our results of operations and financial condition. 

We have in the past acquired, and we may in the future seek to acquire or invest in, businesses, products, teams or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our current platforms, enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated. If we acquire additional businesses, we may not be able to successfully integrate and retain the acquired personnel; integrate the acquired operations and technologies; adequately test and assimilate the internal control processes of the acquired business in accordance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (&#8220;Sarbanes-Oxley Act&#8221;); or effectively manage the combined business. We may also be required to assume liabilities or incur unforeseen costs, such as those arising from the acquired company&#8217;s failure to comply with legal or regulatory requirements and litigation matters. 

Any acquisition or strategic transaction we do consummate could fail to produce the benefits we hope to achieve, which could disrupt our own business or those of our partners and customers, or result in future impairment charges. In particular, from time to time we invest in private growth stage companies for strategic reasons and to support key business initiatives. All of our venture investments are subject to a risk of partial or total loss of investment capital, and we may not realize a return on these investments. 

In addition, we have limited experience in acquiring other businesses. We may not be able to identify desirable acquisition targets, or we may not be successful in entering into an agreement with any particular target. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities, use of our available cash or the incurrence of debt, or in adverse tax consequences or unfavorable accounting treatment. If an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer. 

Because our long-term success depends, in part, on our ability to expand the sales of our solutions to customers located outside of the United States, our business will be susceptible to risks associated with international operations. 

We currently have sales personnel outside the United States and maintain offices outside the United States in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and Europe, and our international revenue was 21% of our total revenue in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025. Any international expansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful. We may face challenges, including those not generally faced in the United States, such as managing and staffing international operations, and becoming familiar with varying technology standards, local laws and business practices. Conducting international operations also subjects us to, among other risks described in these risk factors: 

&#8226; political, economic and social uncertainties, including macroeconomic conditions; 

&#8226; unexpected changes in, or costs and liabilities related to, compliance with foreign legal and regulatory requirements, such as data privacy and cybersecurity regimes; intellectual property rights protections; and requirements relating to the localization of our solutions; 

&#8226; restrictive governmental actions focusing on cross-border trade, including taxes, trade laws, tariffs, import and export restrictions or quotas, barriers, sanctions, custom duties or other trade restrictions; and 

&#8226; difficulties in managing systems integrators and technology partners. 

Establishing operations in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources, and we cannot guarantee that these investments will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability. If we fail to expand our operations successfully and in a timely manner, our business and results of operations will suffer. 

If we fail to adapt to rapid technological change, our ability to remain competitive could be impaired. 

The industry in which we compete is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent introductions of new solutions and evolving industry standards. Our ability to attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers will depend in significant part on our ability to anticipate industry standards and trends. We must continue to enhance existing solutions, or introduce or acquire new solutions on a timely basis to keep pace with technological developments. The success of any enhancement or new solution depends on several factors, including the timely completion and market acceptance of the enhancement or new solution. Any new solution we develop or acquire might not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner and might not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue. If any of our competitors implements new technologies before we are able to implement them, those competitors may be able to provide more effective 

solutions than ours at lower prices. Any delay or failure in the introduction of new or enhanced solutions that gain market acceptance and meet customer requirements could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Our financial results may fluctuate due to increasing variability in our sales cycles. 

We plan our expenses based on certain assumptions about the length and variability of our sales cycle. These assumptions are based upon historical trends for sales cycles and conversion rates associated with our existing customers. We are increasingly focused on sales to larger organizations, which often involve lengthy purchasing approval processes and less predictable sales cycles. The length of sales cycles may be further impacted by the current macroeconomic environment and by the discretionary nature of customer spending. Customers may also take prolonged evaluation periods of our platforms, or their features or functionality, and those of our competitors. As a result, it is difficult to predict exactly when, or even if, we will make a sale. If we are unable to close one or more of expected significant transactions in a particular period, or if such an expected transaction is delayed until a subsequent period, our results of operations for that period, and for any future periods in which revenue from such transaction would otherwise have been recognized, may be harmed. 

Our growth depends, in part, on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties. 

To grow our business, we expect to continue to depend on relationships with third parties, such as channel partners. Identifying partners, negotiating and maintaining relationships with them requires significant time and resources. 

Our ability to compete in the marketplace depends, in part, on whether third parties successfully market, resell, implement or support our solutions for their customers. For example, some of our channel partners sell or provide integration and administration services for our competitors&#8217; solutions. They may choose to devote greater resources to our competitors that are more effective in incentivizing them to favor their solutions over ours. In addition, acquisitions of such partners by our competitors could result in a decrease in the number of our current and potential customers, as these partners may no longer facilitate the adoption of our applications by potential customers. Some of our partners compete with certain of our solutions and may elect to no longer integrate with our platforms or sell our solutions. 

Our growth also depends on our ability to incentivize third-party developers to adopt and build their applications using our APIs and solutions. We believe that these applications facilitate greater usage and customization of our solutions. If these third-party developers stop developing on or supporting our platforms, we will lose the benefit of network effects that have contributed to the growth in our number of customers. 

If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with third parties, our ability to grow our revenue could be impaired, and our results of operations may suffer. Even if we are successful, we cannot ensure that these relationships will result in increased customer usage of our applications or increased revenue. 

Various factors may cause implementation of our solutions to be delayed, inefficient or otherwise unsuccessful. 

Our business depends upon the successful implementation of our solutions by our customers. Increasingly, we, as well as our customers, rely on our network of partners to deliver implementation services, and there may not be enough qualified implementation partners available to meet customer demand. Various other factors may cause implementations to be delayed, inefficient or otherwise unsuccessful, including significant costs to purchase, implement and enable our solutions; changes in our customers&#8217; functional requirements; timeline delays; or deviation from recommended best practices. These and other circumstances may delay our ability to sell additional solutions or result in customers canceling or failing to renew their subscriptions before our solutions have been fully implemented. Unsuccessful, lengthy, or costly customer implementation and integration projects could result in claims from customers, harm to our reputation, and opportunities for competitors to displace our solutions, each of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 

A portion of our revenues are generated by sales to public sector entities, which are subject to a number of challenges and risks. 

We rely on partners to resell our services to public sector entities, and we have made, and plan to continue to make, investments to support future sales opportunities in the public sector. The sale of our services to public sector entities is tied to budget cycles, and there are government requirements and authorizations that we may be required 

to meet. Further, we may be subject to audits and investigations regarding our role as a subcontractor in government contracts, and violations could result in penalties and sanctions, including contract termination, refunding or forfeiting payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. Selling to these entities can be highly competitive, expensive and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense. Public sector entities often require contract terms that differ from our standard arrangements and impose additional compliance requirements, require increased attention to pricing practices, or are otherwise time consuming and expensive to satisfy. For example, some of our public sector customers contract with us on the basis of our authorization under FedRAMP, which requires us to undertake additional actions and expenses to ensure compliance. Public sector entities may also have statutory, contractual, or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our partners for convenience, for lack of funding or due to a default, and any such termination may adversely impact our future results of operations. If we represent that we meet certain standards, authorizations (such as FedRAMP) or requirements and do not meet them, or if such authorizations are suspended or revoked, we could be subject to increased liability from our customers, investigation by regulators, or termination rights. Even if we do meet them, the additional costs associated with providing our service to public sector entities could harm our margins. Moreover, changes in underlying regulatory requirements could be an impediment to our ability to efficiently provide our service to government customers and to grow or maintain our customer base. Any of these risks related to contracting with, or as a subcontractor supporting, public sector entities could adversely impact our future sales and results of operations, or make them more difficult to predict . 

If we fail to enhance our brand cost-effectively, our ability to expand our customer base will be impaired and our business, results of operations and financial condition may suffer. 

We believe that developing and maintaining awareness of our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future solutions, and is an important element in attracting new customers and retaining existing customers. Furthermore, we believe that the importance of brand recognition is likely to increase as competition in our market increases. Successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing and sales efforts, and on our ability to provide reliable and useful solutions at competitive prices and that align with our customers&#8217; needs. In the past, our efforts to build our brand have involved significant expenses and have not always attracted a sufficient number of new customers to be cost-effective. 

As of fiscal 2026, we are further specializing our sales force to better align with our customers and evolving market demands, which will require us to invest significant financial and other resources. We may not achieve anticipated revenue growth if we are unable to hire and develop talented sales personnel, if our new sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time or if we are unable to retain our existing sales personnel. If our marketing and sales efforts are unsuccessful and we fail to enhance our brand we may fail to attract new customers or retain our existing customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer. 

We may not set optimal prices for our solutions. 

In the past, we have at times adjusted our prices either for individual customers in connection with long-term agreements or for a particular solution. We expect that we may need to change our pricing in future periods and potentially in response to the inflation and interest rate environment and increased costs. Further, as competitors introduce new solutions that compete with ours or reduce their prices, we may be unable to attract new customers or retain existing customers based on our historical pricing. As we expand internationally, we also must determine the appropriate price to enable us to compete effectively internationally. In addition, if our mix of solutions sold changes, then we may need to, or choose to, revise our pricing. As a result, we may be required or choose to reduce our prices or change our pricing model, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

If we are not able to consistently generate cash flows or raise additional capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new technologies in the future could reduce our ability to compete successfully and harm our results of operations. 

We may need to raise additional funds, and we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we raise additional equity or convertible debt financing, our security holders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests. If we engage in additional debt financing, we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios or restrict our ability to pay dividends or make acquisitions. If we need additional capital and 

cannot raise it on acceptable terms, or at all, we may not be able to effectively grow our business or respond to competitive pressures, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

We may be subject to liability claims if we breach our contracts and our insurance may be inadequate to cover our losses. 

We are subject to numerous obligations in our contracts with our customers and partners. Despite the procedures, systems and internal controls we have implemented to comply with our contracts, we may breach these commitments, whether through a weakness in these procedures, systems and internal controls, negligence or the willful act of an employee or contractor. Our insurance policies, including our errors and omissions insurance, may be inadequate to compensate us for the potentially significant losses that may result from claims arising from breaches of our contracts, disruptions in our service, including those caused by cybersecurity incidents, failures or disruptions to our infrastructure, catastrophic events and disasters or otherwise. In addition, such insurance may not be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Further, our insurance may not cover all claims made against us and defending a suit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management&#8217;s attention. 

Evolving and complex scrutiny of sustainability matters may require us to incur additional costs or otherwise adversely impact our business. 

Increased attention to environmental sustainability and social issues, as well as societal expectations regarding voluntary sustainability initiatives and disclosures, may result in increased costs (including but not limited to, increased costs related to compliance, stakeholder engagement and contracting), impact our reputation, or otherwise affect our business performance. We have undertaken certain sustainability-related initiatives, goals and commitments, which we have communicated on our website, in our SEC filings and elsewhere. We may undertake additional actions, including establishing certain sustainability goals or targets, to improve our sustainability profile and/or respond to demand from investors, regulators, customers and other stakeholders, both U.S.-based and internationally. However, such actions may be costly or subject to numerous conditions that are outside our control, and we cannot guarantee that such actions will have the desired effect. Our actual or perceived failure to achieve such goals or targets could negatively impact our reputation and impact our ability to compete as effectively to recruit or retain employees. 

Risks Related to Intellectual Property, Infrastructure Technology, Data Privacy and Security 

Interruptions or performance problems that impact the functionality of our technology, systems, or infrastructure could result in delays in the deployment of our platforms. 

Our continued growth depends, in part, on the ability of our existing and potential customers to access our platforms 24 hours a day, seven days a week, without interruption or degradation of performance. System interruption and a lack of integration and redundancy in our information systems and infrastructure may adversely affect our ability to operate websites, process and fulfill transactions, respond to customer inquiries, and generally maintain cost-efficient operations. We have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, disruptions, data loss or corruption, outages, and other performance problems with our infrastructure or service due to a variety of factors. These factors include, for example, infrastructure and functionality changes, human or software errors, capacity constraints, ransomware attacks that encrypt our data and render it inaccessible, or security-related incidents. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems immediately, and it could take months, or even years, for such problems to become pronounced enough for us to detect or for our customers to detect and inform us. We may not be able to maintain the level of service uptime and performance required by our customers, especially during peak usage times and as our solutions become more complex and our user traffic increases. If our platforms are unavailable or if our customers are unable to access our solutions or deploy them within a reasonable amount of time, or at all, our business would be harmed. Since our customers rely on our service to access and complete their work, any outage on our platforms would impair the ability of our customers to perform their work, which would negatively impact our brand, reputation and customer satisfaction. 

Our platforms are accessed by a large number of customers, often at the same time, and we continue to expand the number of our customers and solutions available to our customers. While we rely on third-party information technology systems, broadband and other communications systems and service providers to assist in providing access to our platforms, maintaining our infrastructure, and distributing our solutions via the internet, we may not be able to scale our technology to accommodate increased capacity requirements, which may result in 

interruptions or delays in service. If a service provider fails to provide sufficient capacity to support our platforms or otherwise experiences service outages, including intentionally blocking our internet traffic or all internet traffic, for example at the request of a national government intending to isolate its country&#8217;s network, such failure could interrupt our customers&#8217; access to our service, which could adversely affect their perception of our platforms&#8217; reliability and our revenues. Any disruptions in these services, including as a result of actions outside of our control, would significantly impact the continued performance of our solutions. In the future, these services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of these services could result in decreased functionality of our solutions until equivalent technology is either developed by us or, if available from another provider, is identified, obtained and integrated into our infrastructure. If we do not accurately predict our infrastructure capacity requirements, our customers could experience service shortfalls. We may also be unable to effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed, and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology. 

Any of the above circumstances or events may harm our reputation, cause customers to terminate their agreements with us, impair our ability to obtain subscription renewals from existing customers, impair our ability to grow our customer base, result in the expenditure of significant financial, technical and engineering resources, subject us to financial penalties and liabilities under our service level agreements, and otherwise harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

In the past, we have experienced cybersecurity incidents that allowed unauthorized access to our systems or data or our customers&#8217; data, harmed our reputation, created additional liability, and adversely impacted our financial results. We and our third-party service providers may experience similar incidents in the future which may also include disabling access to our service. 

Increasingly, companies, including Okta, Inc., are subject to a wide variety of attacks on their systems and networks on an ongoing basis. In addition to threats from traditional computer &#8220;hackers,&#8221; malicious code (such as malware, viruses, worms and ransomware), employee or contractor theft or misuse, password spraying, phishing and denial-of-service attacks, we and our third-party service providers now also face threats from sophisticated nation-state actors and organized crime groups who engage in attacks (including advanced persistent threat intrusions) that add to the risks to our systems (including those hosted on AWS&#8217; or other cloud services providers&#8217; systems), internal networks, our customers&#8217; systems and the information that we and they store and process. For example, like other companies, we have experienced an increase in cybersecurity attacks and have had to expend increasing amounts of human and financial capital to respond. We expect that these cybersecurity attacks will continue and that the scope and sophistication of these efforts will increase in future periods. Despite significant efforts to create security barriers to such threats, it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate these risks. As a provider of independent and neutral cloud-based identity solutions that form a part of our customers&#8217; security software supply chain, we pose an attractive target for such attacks. The security measures we have integrated into our internal systems and platforms, which are designed to detect unauthorized activity and prevent or minimize security breaches, may not function as expected and have not in the past been, and may not in the future be, sufficient to protect our internal networks and platforms against certain attacks. In addition, techniques used to sabotage or to obtain unauthorized access to networks in which data is stored or through which data is transmitted change frequently, become more complex over time. As a result, we and our third-party service providers have in the past been, and may in the future be, unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures quickly enough to prevent either an electronic intrusion into our systems or services or a compromise of customer data, employee data or other protected information. 

Our customers&#8217; use of our technology to access business systems and store data concerning, among others, their employees, contractors, partners and customers is essential to their use of our platforms, which stores, transmits and processes customers&#8217; proprietary information and users&#8217; personal data experienced and likely will in the future experience attacks targeting such customer data. When such breaches occur, as a result of third-party action, technology limitations, employee or contractor error, malfeasance or otherwise, and if the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our customers&#8217; data or systems is disrupted, we could incur significant liability to our customers and to individuals or businesses whose information was being stored by our customers, and our platforms may be perceived as less desirable, which could negatively affect our business and damage our reputation. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target. As a result, we, our third-party service providers and our customers have not in the past been, and may not in the future be, able to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. Further, because we do not control our third-party service providers, or the processing of data by our third-party service providers, we cannot ensure the integrity or security of measures they take to protect customer information and prevent data loss. 

In addition, security breaches impacting our platforms have in certain cases resulted in and could in the future result in a risk of loss or unauthorized disclosure or theft of this information, or the denial of access to this information, which, in turn, could lead to enforcement actions, litigation, regulatory or governmental audits, investigations and possible liability, and increased requests by individuals regarding their personal data. Security breaches could also damage our relationships with and ability to attract customers and partners, and trigger service availability, indemnification and other contractual obligations. For example, our customers have in the past published public criticisms of our security practices in connection with security incidents, and these postings harm our reputation and brand. Security incidents may also cause us to incur significant investigation, mitigation, remediation, notification and other expenses. Furthermore, as a well-known provider of identity and security solutions that form a part of our customers&#8217; security software supply chain, any such breach, including a breach of our customers&#8217; systems, could compromise systems secured by our solutions, creating system disruptions or slowdowns and exploiting security vulnerabilities of our or our customers&#8217; systems, and the information stored on our or our customers&#8217; systems could be accessed, publicly disclosed, altered, lost or stolen, which could subject us to liability and cause us financial harm. Our disclosures concerning security incidents also may become the subject of litigation, and our disclosures concerning the January 2022 compromise, for example, have become the subject of lawsuits, as discussed in Item 3, &#8220; Legal Proceedings &#8221; below. While we have taken a number of remediation steps, there is no guarantee that our preventative and mitigation actions with respect to this incident and others like it will fully eliminate the risk of a malicious compromise of our or our customers&#8217; systems. 

We have experienced cybersecurity incidents resulting from our use of and oversight over third-party service providers and could experience such incidents in the future. These incidents have, in the past, and may, in the future, result from our configuration of such providers&#8217; products or from cybersecurity attacks on such providers of the same type that could affect our own systems. While we have implemented security measures and configuration policies that seek to protect data stored with our third-party service providers, such measures and policies have not in the past been, and may not in the future be, sufficient to protect our data or our customers&#8217; data. For example, the January 2022 compromise of one of our third-party service providers by a threat actor, even though not material and not a breach of our platforms, nonetheless was widely publicized and focused attention on the security of our systems and the systems of our third-party service providers. In addition, in October 2023, a threat actor gained unauthorized access to and stole information from inside our customer support system, which was hosted by a third-party service provider. 

While we maintain cybersecurity insurance, our insurance may be insufficient to cover all liabilities incurred in these incidents, and any incidents may result in loss of, or increased costs of, our cybersecurity insurance. These breaches, or any perceived breach, of our systems, our customers&#8217; systems, our service providers&#8217; systems, or other systems or networks secured by our platforms, whether or not any such breach is due to a vulnerability in our platforms, may also undermine confidence in our platforms or our industry and result in damage to our reputation and brand, negative publicity, loss of ISVs and other channel partners, customers and sales, increased costs to remedy any problem, costly litigation and other liability. In addition, a breach of the security measures of one of our key ISVs or other channel partners or a security software supply chain attack even many levels removed could result in the exfiltration of confidential corporate information or other data that may provide additional avenues of attack. For example, an exploitation in an open source library that is imported and used in another framework that is used by a software product used by Okta, Inc. could introduce an avenue of attack into our platforms. If a high profile security breach occurs with respect to a comparable cloud technology provider, our customers and potential customers may lose trust in the security of the cloud business model generally, which could adversely impact our ability to retain existing customers or attract new ones, potentially causing a negative impact on our business. Any of these negative outcomes could adversely impact market acceptance of our solutions and could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Third parties have induced and may continue to fraudulently induce employees, contractors, customers or our customers&#8217; users into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information or otherwise compromise the security of our applications, internal networks, electronic systems and/or physical facilities in order to gain access to our data or our customers&#8217; data, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure, a loss of confidence in the security of our platforms, interruptions or malfunctions in our operations, account lockouts, and, ultimately, harm to our future business prospects and revenue. We may be required to expend significant capital and financial resources to protect against such threats or to alleviate problems caused by breaches in security. 

We and our third-party service providers have, in the past, failed or been perceived to have failed to fully comply with the privacy or security provisions of our privacy policy, our contracts and/or legal or 

regulatory requirements, which could result in proceedings, actions or penalties against us. We may experience similar incidents in the future. 

Our customers&#8217; storage and use of data concerning, among others, their employees, contractors, partners and customers is essential to their use of our platforms. We have implemented various features intended to enable our customers to better comply with applicable privacy and security requirements in their collection and use of data within our online service, but these features have, in the past, not ensured and may, in the future, not ensure our customers&#8217; compliance and may not be effective against all potential privacy or related regulatory concerns. 

Many jurisdictions have enacted or are considering enacting or revising privacy and/or data security legislation, including laws and regulations applying to the collection, use, storage, transfer, disclosure and/or processing of personal data. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws and regulations that are applicable to the operations of our customers may limit the use and adoption of our service and reduce overall demand for it. These privacy and data security related laws and regulations are evolving and may result in increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. In addition, we are subject to certain contractual obligations regarding the collection, use, storage, transfer, disclosure and/or processing of personal data. Although we are working to comply with those federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations and other legal obligations that apply to us, those laws, regulations, standards and obligations are evolving and may be modified, interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, and may conflict with one another, other requirements or legal obligations, our practices or the features of our platforms. 

We also expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations, self-regulatory and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, digital services, and information security in the United States, China, the European Union, India and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission and state regulators enforce a variety of data privacy issues, such as promises made in privacy policies or failures to appropriately protect information about individuals, as unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act or similar state laws. On the U.S. state level, over a dozen states have adopted new or modified privacy and security laws. These laws create a patchwork of legislation and regulation that impose heightened transparency obligations about data collection, use, and sharing practices, add restrictions on the &#8220;sale&#8221; or &#8220;sharing&#8221; or transfer of personal information to third parties for purposes such as advertising or analytics, create new data privacy rights for consumers including the ability to limit the use of personal information for advertising, and carry significant enforcement penalties for non-compliance, including monetary and injunctive relief. This patchwork may also give rise to conflicts or differing views of personal privacy rights. For example, certain state laws may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to personal data than federal, international or other state laws, and such laws may differ from each other, all of which may complicate compliance efforts. We may expend significant resources attempting to comply with conflicting and overlapping state privacy regulations, and the cost and complexity of complying with such regulations could adversely affect our business or increase our potential liability if we fail to comply. This influx of state privacy regimes indicates a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States, including a potential federal privacy law, which could also increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business. In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the &#8220;GDPR&#8221;) imposes a strict data protection compliance regime in relation to the collection and processing of personal data, and various European and other foreign laws also restrict the use of cookies, tracking technologies, and certain marketing activities. 

Future laws, regulations, standards and other obligations, and changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations, standards and other obligations could impair our or our customers&#8217; ability to collect, use or disclose information relating to consumers, which could decrease demand for our applications, restrict our business operations, or increase our costs and impair our ability to maintain and grow our customer base and increase our revenue. Such laws and regulations may require companies to implement privacy and security policies, permit users to exercise various data rights, inform individuals of security breaches that affect their personal data, and, in some cases, obtain individuals&#8217; consent to use personal data for certain purposes. If we, or the third parties on which we rely, fail to comply with federal, state and international data privacy laws and regulations our ability to successfully operate our business and pursue our business goals could be harmed. Additionally, plaintiffs have become increasingly more active in bringing privacy-related claims against companies. Some of these claims allow for the recovery of statutory damages on a per violation basis, and, if viable, carry the potential for significant statutory damages, depending on the volume of data and the number of violations. 

With respect to cybersecurity in the United States, the development of rules and guidance pursuant to various executive orders may apply to us, including, for example, pursuant to Executive Order 14028 for &#8220;critical software.&#8221; While the rules and guidance coming from the Order are still being developed, we are likely to be categorized as a provider of critical software, which may increase our compliance costs and delay or prevent our ability to execute contracts with customers, including in particular with government entities. 

Any failure or perceived failure by us or our third-party service providers to comply with federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations, compliance frameworks with which Okta, Inc. has contractually committed to comply, or any actual or suspected privacy or security incident, even if unfounded, whether or not resulting in unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release or transfer of personal data or other data, may result in investigations and enforcement actions and prosecutions, private litigation (including class action lawsuits), fines, penalties and censure, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, or adverse publicity and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. 

We publicly post our privacy policies and practices concerning our processing, use and disclosure of the personal data provided to us by our website visitors and by our customers, and other individuals with whom we interact. Our publication of our privacy policies and other statements we publish that provide promises and assurances about privacy and security can subject us to potential state and federal action if they are found to be unfair, deceptive, or misrepresentative of our practices. 

If our platforms are perceived to cause, or are otherwise unfavorably associated with, violations of privacy or data security requirements, it may subject us or our customers to public criticism and potential legal liability. Existing and potential privacy laws and regulations concerning privacy and data security and increasing sensitivity of consumers to unauthorized processing of personal data may create negative public reactions to technologies, solutions and services such as ours. Public concerns regarding personal data processing, privacy and security may cause some of our customers&#8217; end users to be less likely to visit their websites or otherwise interact with them. If enough end users choose not to visit our customers&#8217; websites or otherwise interact with them, our customers could stop using our platforms. This, in turn, may reduce the value of our service, and slow or eliminate the growth of our business, or cause our business to contract. 

Privacy is a key issue for Okta, Inc. and for our customers. We have attained multiple privacy certifications, such as the Privacy Recognition for Processors, and the European Union Cloud Code of Conduct, Level 2. If we fail to maintain our privacy certifications, or if we fail to seek expansion of their applicability to acquired and/or newly-developed solutions, we may fail to meet our contractual commitments and we may fail to retain our existing customers or attract new customers, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer. 

We may face particular privacy, data security and data protection risks due to stringent data protection and privacy laws and increased scrutiny over data transfers. 

We are subject to global data protection laws and regulations (&#8220;Data Protection Laws&#8221;) that may impact how we do business with customers. Data Protection Laws, such as those applicable in the European Union, Canada and certain of its provinces, United Kingdom, Asia, and certain states in the United States, have enhanced data protection obligations for companies that handle personal data. Obligations include, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal data is to be used, individual rights in relation to personal data, limitations on retention of personal data, mandatory data breach notification requirements and strict obligations on service providers, and restrictions on online marketing and the use of cookies and tracking technologies. 

In addition, increasing numbers of Data Protection Laws restrict transfers of personal data outside of their country of origin to countries deemed to lack adequate privacy protections. These types of transfers must be supported by a transfer mechanism that we may be required to implement, and in many jurisdictions there is significant legal uncertainty around the validity and sufficiency of data transfer mechanisms, and evolving legal and regulatory expectations could impose additional obligations or require expenditure of additional resources to comply with the Data Protection Laws. 

Data Protection Laws are rapidly expanding and evolving, and many have extraterritorial effect, which may increase our compliance costs and expose us to greater enforcement risk. In addition, we may be or become subject to data localization laws, which require personal data, or certain subcategories of personal data, to be stored in the jurisdiction of origin. These regulations may deter customers from using cloud-based services such as ours and may inhibit our ability to expand into those markets or prohibit us from continuing to offer services in those markets without significant additional costs. 

This regulatory environment applicable to the handling of personal data, and our actions taken in response, may cause us to assume additional liabilities or incur additional costs and could result in our business, results of operations and financial condition being harmed. We and our customers may face a risk of enforcement actions by an increasing number of global data protection authorities in countries where data protection laws apply to us and with which we may not be able to comply. Any such enforcement actions could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, distract management and technical personnel and negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Non-compliance with these obligations can trigger significant fines and other penalties. Regulatory bodies can also issue orders to cease or change data processing, enforcement notices and/or assessment notices (for a compulsory audit), and civil claims (including class actions) for compensation or damages. In addition to fines, some U.S. states allow a private right of action. Given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, complying with these requirements has caused us to expend significant resources, which is likely to continue into the near future as we respond to new interpretations and enforcement actions. 

In addition, new laws are continually being passed and new case law and regulatory guidance means Data Protection Laws are constantly evolving. For example, India recently passed a comprehensive data protection law that will apply new privacy rules for the first time in that country. In addition, the number of U.S. states with comprehensive Data Protection Laws significantly increased in 2024. We cannot yet determine the impact that such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. Such laws and regulations are often subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. We could incur substantial expense in complying with any new obligations, be required to make significant changes to our business operations or to the development of new or existing solutions, and we may not be able to comply with some of these regulatory developments, all of which may adversely affect our revenues and our business overall. 

If we fail to maintain our security attestations and certifications, our business, results of operations and financial condition may suffer. 

Security is essential for us and for our customers. A number of our Okta Platform product offerings have attained multiple certifications, including SOC 2 Type II Attestations, CSA Star Level 2 Certification, ISO/IEC 27001:2022, ISO/IEC 27017:2015, ISO/IEC 27018:2019 and comply with many other international frameworks. Certain Okta Platform offerings maintain multiple agency FedRAMP Authorities to Operate and are compliant to operate at Department of Defense Impact Level 4. Certain Okta Platform offerings maintain minimum security requirements in alignment with the Security Rule of HIPAA. The Okta Platform also supports FIPS 140-2 encryption requirements. If we fail to maintain our security attestations and certifications, or if we fail to seek expansion of their applicability to acquired and/or newly-developed products, we may fail to meet our contractual commitments and we may fail to retain our existing customers or attract new customers, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer. 

We provide service level commitments under our customer contracts. If we fail to meet these contractual commitments, we could be obligated to provide credits for future service, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Our customer agreements contain service level commitments, under which we guarantee specified availability of our platforms. Any failure of or disruption to our infrastructure could make our platforms unavailable to our customers. If we are unable to meet the stated service level commitments to our customers or suffer extended periods of unavailability of our platforms, we have been, and could in the future be, contractually obligated to provide affected customers with service credits for future subscriptions. Our revenue, other results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we suffer unscheduled downtime that exceeds the service level commitments under our agreements with our customers, and any extended service outages could adversely affect our business and reputation as customers may elect not to renew and we could lose future sales. 

If we are unable to ensure that our solutions integrate or interoperate with a variety of operating systems, platforms, services, software applications devices, mobile phones and other hardware form factors that are developed by others, our platforms may become less competitive and our results of operations may be harmed. 

The number of people who access the internet through mobile devices and access cloud-based software applications through mobile devices, including smartphones and handheld tablets or laptop computers, has increased significantly in the past several years and is expected to continue to increase. While we have created mobile applications and mobile versions of our solutions that are accessible on third-party application stores, if 

these mobile applications and solutions do not perform well, our business may suffer. Third-party application stores may also impose new requirements, including, for example, updates to their terms of access or policies on how we or our channel partners must collect, use, and share data. Compliance with any such requirements could be costly or burdensome, and could prevent us from timely updating our current mobile applications or distributing new mobile applications. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could lose access to, or be required to remove our mobile applications from, third-party application stores. 

In addition, our solutions interoperate with servers, mobile devices and software applications predominantly through the use of protocols, many of which are created and maintained by third parties. As a result, we depend on the interoperability of our solutions with such third-party services, mobile devices and mobile operating systems, as well as cloud-enabled hardware, software, networking, browsers, database technologies and protocols that we do not control. Past and future changes in such technologies that degrade the functionality of our solutions or give preferential treatment to competitive services have, in the past, and could, in the future, adversely affect adoption and usage of our platforms. Any change in our customers&#8217; preference for cloud-based identity management or any shift towards on-premises systems could also adversely affect adoption and usage of our platforms. Also, we may not be successful in developing or maintaining relationships with key participants in the mobile industry or in developing solutions that operate effectively with a range of operating systems, networks, devices, browsers, protocols and standards. In addition, we may face different fraud, security and regulatory risks from transactions sent from mobile devices than we do from personal computers. If we are unable to effectively anticipate and manage these risks, or if it is difficult for our customers to access and use our platforms, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be harmed. 

Our success also depends on the willingness of third-party developers and technology providers to build applications and provide integrations that are complementary to our service. Without the development of these applications and integrations, both current and potential customers may not find our service sufficiently attractive, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer. 

Interruptions or delays in the services provided by third-party data centers or internet service providers have, in the past, and could, in the future, impair the delivery of our platforms and our business could suffer. 

We rely on a number of third-party service providers to operate our services. For example, we host our platforms using AWS data centers and other third-party cloud infrastructure services. Our operations depend on protecting the virtual cloud infrastructure hosted in AWS or other cloud services by maintaining its configuration, architecture and interconnection specifications, as well as the information stored in these virtual data centers and which third-party internet service providers transmit. Service interruptions from such infrastructure providers have caused, and could in the future cause, outages on our platforms. Our solutions use resources operated by us in these locations. Although we have disaster recovery plans that use multiple virtual data center locations, any incident affecting their infrastructure, including events beyond our control, could negatively affect our platforms, harm our reputation, and expose us to liability. We may also incur significant costs for using alternative equipment or taking other actions in preparation for, or in reaction to, events that damage the third-party services we use. 

We rely on software and services from other parties. Defects in or the loss of access to software or services from third parties could increase our costs and adversely affect the quality of our solutions. 

We rely on technologies from third parties to operate critical functions of our business, including cloud infrastructure services and customer relationship management services. Our business would be disrupted if any of the third-party software or services we use, or functional equivalents, were unavailable due to defects in the software or services from those third parties, or because they are no longer available on commercially reasonable terms or prices. In each case, we would be required to either seek licenses to software or services from other parties and redesign our solutions to function with such software or services or develop substitutes ourselves, which would result in increased costs and could result in delays in launches or releases of new solutions until equivalent technology can be identified, licensed or developed, and integrated into our solutions. Furthermore, we might be forced to limit the features available in our current or future solutions. These delays and feature limitations, if they occur, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Real or perceived errors, failures, vulnerabilities or bugs in our solutions, including deployment complexity, have, in the past and could, in the future, harm our business and results of operations. 

Errors, failures, vulnerabilities or bugs have, in the past and may, in the future, occur in our solutions, especially when updates are deployed or new solutions are rolled out, maintenance patches are applied, or 

infrastructure, architectural or configuration changes are made. In the past, such issues have caused outages for our customers. Our platforms are often used in connection with large-scale computing environments with different operating systems, system management software, equipment and networking configurations, which may cause errors or failures of our solutions, or other aspects of the computing environment into which our solutions are deployed. In addition, deployment of our solutions into complicated, large-scale computing environments may expose errors, failures, vulnerabilities or bugs in our solutions. Any such errors, failures, vulnerabilities or bugs may not be found until after they are deployed to our customers. 

We are committed to increasing our transparency with our customers and the public about our solutions and technology. This transparency, which may be more than is expected of companies in our industry, could lead to us publicly disclosing information that we would not otherwise be legally required to disclose, such as errors, failures, vulnerabilities or bugs in our solutions and technology. As a result, we could experience negative publicity that could harm our business. Any real or perceived errors, failures, vulnerabilities or bugs in our solutions, or delays in or difficulties implementing our solutions, could also result in: loss, compromise, corruption or other unavailability of customer data; disruptions to our solutions or our customers&#8217; products, systems, networks, and operations; loss of business and new customers; loss of or delay in market acceptance of our solutions; a decrease in customer satisfaction or adoption rates; loss of competitive position; or claims by customers for losses sustained by them, all of which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 

Issues in the development and use of artificial intelligence (&#8220;AI&#8221;), combined with an uncertain regulatory environment, may result in reputational harm, liability, or other adverse consequences to our business operations. 

We use internally developed and third-party developed machine learning and AI technologies in our offerings and business, and we are making investments in expanding our AI capabilities in our portfolio, including ongoing deployment and improvement of existing machine learning and AI technologies, as well as developing new product features using AI technologies, including, for example, generative AI. AI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and we face significant competition from other companies as well as an evolving regulatory landscape. For example, in the European Union, the Artificial Intelligence Act establishes obligations on the use of AI based on the type of AI and its potential risks to society. Additionally, in the United States, federal and state legislatures and agencies are introducing legal frameworks and rules governing AI. The introduction of AI technologies into new or existing solutions may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, confidentiality or security risks, ethical concerns, or other complications that could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results. For example, even if permitted by our privacy policy and contractual rights, our use of data in novel AI applications may, in time, expand beyond customer expectations. The intellectual property ownership and license rights, including copyright, surrounding AI technologies has not been fully addressed by courts or national or local laws or regulations, and the use or adoption of third-party AI technologies into our solutions may result in exposure to claims of copyright infringement or other intellectual property misappropriation. Uncertainty around new and emerging AI technologies, such as generative AI, may require additional investment in the development and maintenance of proprietary datasets and machine learning models, development of new approaches and processes to provide attribution or remuneration to creators of training data, and development of appropriate protections and safeguards for handling the use of customer data with AI technologies, which may be costly and could impact our expenses as we continue to expand generative AI into our product offerings. AI technologies, including generative AI, may create content that appears correct but is factually inaccurate or flawed. Our customers or others may rely on or use this flawed content to their detriment, which may expose us to brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, and/or legal liability. The use of AI technologies presents emerging ethical and social issues, and if we enable or offer solutions that draw scrutiny or controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on customers or on society as a whole, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, and/or legal liability. 

If we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights, our competitive position could be impaired and we may lose valuable assets, generate less revenue and incur costly litigation to protect our rights. 

Our success is dependent, in part, upon protecting our proprietary information and technology. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate. We will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our solutions and use information that we regard as proprietary to create solutions that compete with ours. Some contract provisions protecting against unauthorized use, copying, transfer and disclosure of our solutions may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries. Further, the laws of 

some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries may be inadequate. To the extent we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our solutions and proprietary information may increase. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our technology and intellectual property. 

We rely in part on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and other confidential information to maintain our competitive position. Although we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with the parties with whom we have strategic relationships and business alliances, no assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our solutions and proprietary information. Further, these agreements do not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our solutions. 

To protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets. Such litigation could be costly, time consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management&#8217;s attention and resources, could delay further sales or the implementation of our solutions, impair the functionality of our solutions, delay introductions of new solutions, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our solutions, or injure our reputation. In addition, we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop and market new solutions, and we cannot ensure that we can license that technology on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and our inability to license this technology could harm our ability to compete. 

We have in the past, and may in the future be subject to infringement claims, which could result in significant damage awards that could harm our results of operations. 

There is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity in our industry, and we expect that software companies will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of solutions and competitors grows, and the functionality of solutions in different industry segments overlaps. In addition, the patent portfolios of many of our competitors are larger than ours, and this disparity may increase the risk that our competitors may sue us for patent infringement and may limit our ability to counterclaim for patent infringement or settle through patent cross-licenses. Other companies have claimed in the past, and may claim in the future, that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights. A claim may also be made relating to technology that we acquire or license from third parties. Further, we may be unaware of the intellectual property rights of others that may cover some or all of our technology. 

Any claim of infringement, regardless of its merit or our defenses, could subject us to a number of risks described elsewhere in these risk factors, including those discussed under the title, &#8220; If we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights, our competitive position could be impaired and we may lose valuable assets, generate less revenue and incur costly litigation to protect our rights .&#8221; 

We use open source software in our platforms, which could negatively affect our ability to offer our solutions and subject us to litigation or other actions. 

We use open source software in our solutions and expect to use more open source software in the future. From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products. However, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our solutions. In addition, if we were to combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain of the open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public, which could open security risks as well as risks to exposing some of our trade secrets. This would allow our competitors to create similar solutions with less development effort and time. If we inappropriately use open source software, or if the license 

terms for open source software that we use change, we may be required to re-engineer our solutions, incur additional costs, discontinue the sale of some or all of our solutions or take other remedial actions. Some open source software may include generative AI software or other software that incorporates or relies on generative AI or other AI technologies. The use of such software may expose us to risks as the intellectual property ownership and license rights, including copyright, of generative AI software and tools, has not been fully interpreted by U.S. courts or been fully addressed by federal or state regulation. 

In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or assurance of title or controls on origin of the software. In addition, many of the risks associated with usage of open source software, such as security issues, potential loss of trade secret protection, and the lack of warranties or assurances of title, cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. We have established processes to help alleviate these risks, including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source software, but we cannot be sure that all of our use of open source software is in a manner that is consistent with our current policies and procedures, or will not subject us to liability. 

Indemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses. 

Our agreements with customers and other third parties include provisions under which we agree to indemnify or otherwise be liable to them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement, damages caused by us to property or persons, or other liabilities relating to or arising from the use of our platforms or other acts or omissions. From time to time, customers also require us to indemnify or otherwise be liable to them for breach of confidentiality, violation of applicable law, or failure to implement adequate security measures with respect to their data stored, transmitted, or accessed using our platforms. The term of these contractual provisions often survives termination or expiration of the applicable agreement. Although we normally contractually limit our liability with respect to such obligations, the existence of such a dispute may have adverse effects on our customer relationship and reputation and we may still incur substantial liability or large indemnity payments. This could significantly increase our operating expenses, require us to restrict our business activities, and limit our ability to deliver certain solutions, all of which could require significant time, effort and expense, harm our reputation and customer relationships, and negatively affect our business. 

Risks Related to Legal, Accounting and Tax Matters 

Because we generally recognize revenue from our subscriptions and support services over the term of the relevant service period, a decrease in sales during a reporting period may not be immediately reflected in our results of operations for that period. 

We generally recognize revenue from subscriptions and related support services revenue ratably over the relevant service period. Net new revenue from new subscriptions, upsells and renewals entered into during a period can generally be expected to generate revenue for the duration of the service period. As a result, most of the revenue we report in each period is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscriptions and support services contracts entered into during previous periods. Consequently, a decrease in new or renewed subscriptions in any single reporting period will have a limited impact on our revenue for that period, but will negatively affect our revenue in future periods. In addition, our ability to adjust our cost structure in the event of a decrease in new or renewed subscriptions may be limited. 

Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from customers is generally recognized over the applicable service period. Additionally, due to the complexity of certain of our customer contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment required under relevant accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) will depend on contract-specific terms and may result in greater variability in revenue from period to period. 

In addition, a decrease in new subscriptions or renewals in a reporting period may not have an immediate impact on billings for that period. 

We face exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 

Today, a vast majority of our customer contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars. Over time, however, an increasing portion of our international customer contracts may be denominated in local currencies. In addition, the majority of our international costs are denominated in local currencies. As a result, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may affect our results of operations when translated into U.S. dollars. We do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. However, in the future, we may use derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. Moreover, the use of hedging instruments may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments. 

We are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery and similar laws, and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal penalties or significant fines and harm our business and reputation. 

We are subject to anti-corruption and anti-bribery and similar laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the &#8220;FCPA&#8221;), the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 201, U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 and other anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees and agents from promising, authorizing, making or offering improper payments or other benefits to government officials and others in the private sector. As we increase our international sales and business, our risks under these laws may increase. 

In addition, we use channel partners to sell our solutions and conduct business on our behalf. We or such partners may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and under certain circumstances we could be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of such partners, and our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. 

Noncompliance with the FCPA, other applicable anti-corruption laws, or anti-money laundering laws could subject us to investigations, whistleblower complaints, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, and other enforcement actions within the U.S. and internationally, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition. 

We are subject to governmental export controls and economic sanctions laws that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws. 

Our business activities are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export controls and trade and economic sanctions laws, which include prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons and entities and also require authorization for the export of encryption items. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our service or could limit our customers&#8217; ability to implement our service in those countries. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export privileges and monetary penalties. Obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular transaction may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed, and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Although we take precautions to prevent our solutions from being provided in violation of such laws, our solutions may have been in the past, and could in the future be, provided inadvertently in violation of such laws, despite the precautions we take. This could result in negative consequences to us, including government investigations, penalties and harm to our reputation. 

Our international operations may give rise to potentially adverse tax consequences. 

We are expanding our international operations and staff to better support our growth into certain international markets. Our corporate structure and associated transfer pricing policies anticipate future growth into certain international markets. The amount of taxes we pay in different jurisdictions may depend on the application of the tax laws of the various jurisdictions, including the United States, to our international business activities, changes in tax rates, new or revised tax laws or interpretations of existing tax laws and policies and our ability to operate our 

business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for pricing intercompany transactions, which are generally required to be computed on an arm&#8217;s-length basis pursuant to intercompany arrangements or disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a challenge or disagreement were to occur, and our position was not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced net cash flows and lower overall profitability of our operations. Our financial statements could fail to reflect adequate reserves to cover such a contingency. 

Changes in tax laws or regulations in the various tax jurisdictions we are subject to that are applied adversely to us or our customers could increase the costs of our solutions and harm our business. 

New income, sales, use, value-added or other transaction level taxes, tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time. Those enactments could adversely impact our domestic and international business operations, and our business and financial performance. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. These events could require us or our customers to pay additional tax amounts on a prospective or retroactive basis, as well as require us or our customers to pay fines and/or penalties and interest for past amounts deemed to be due. If we raise our prices to offset the costs of these additional taxes, existing and potential future customers may elect not to purchase our solutions in the future. Additionally, new, changed, modified or newly interpreted or applied tax laws could increase our compliance, operating and other costs, as well as the costs of our solutions to our customers. Further, these events could decrease the capital we have available to operate our business. Any or all of these events could harm our business and financial performance. For example, various legislative and regulatory actions and proposals, such as in the United States, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the EU, have increasingly focused on future tax reform and contemplate changes to long-standing tax principles, which could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. 

As a multinational organization, we may be subject to taxation in certain jurisdictions around the world with increasingly complex tax laws, the application of which can be uncertain. The amount of taxes we pay in these jurisdictions could increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents, which could harm our liquidity and results of operations. In addition, the authorities in these jurisdictions could review our tax returns and impose additional tax, interest and penalties, and the authorities could claim that various withholding requirements apply to us or our subsidiaries or assert that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us or our subsidiaries, any of which could harm us and our results of operations. 

Our business may be subject to additional obligations to collect and remit sales tax and other taxes, and we may be subject to tax liability for past sales. Any successful action by state, foreign or other authorities to collect additional or past sales tax could harm our business. 

State, foreign and local taxing jurisdictions have differing rules and regulations governing sales, use and other indirect taxes (including digital services taxes), and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. In particular, the applicability of certain sales, value-added and digital services taxes to our platforms in various jurisdictions is unclear. It is possible that we could face tax audits and that our liability for these taxes could exceed our estimates as tax authorities could still assert that we are obligated to collect additional amounts as taxes from our customers and remit those taxes to those authorities. We could also be subject to audits in states and international jurisdictions for which we have not accrued tax liabilities. A successful assertion that we should be collecting additional sales or other taxes on our solutions and services in jurisdictions where we have not historically done so and do not accrue for such taxes could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, discourage customers from purchasing our solutions or otherwise harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

We file sales tax returns in certain states within the United States as required by law and certain customer contracts for a portion of the solutions that we provide. We do not collect sales or other similar taxes in other states and many of such states do not apply sales or similar taxes to the vast majority of the solutions that we provide. However, one or more states or foreign authorities could seek to impose additional sales, use or other tax collection and record-keeping obligations on us or may determine that such taxes should have, but have not been, paid by us. Liability for past taxes may also include substantial interest and penalty charges. Any successful action by state, foreign or other authorities to compel us to collect and remit sales tax, use tax or other taxes, either retroactively, prospectively or both, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Our ability to use our U.S. net operating loss carry-forwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. 

Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an &#8220;ownership change,&#8221; generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation&#8217;s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carry-forwards and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research tax credits and distributed interest deduction carryover, to offset its post-change income may be limited. We have experienced ownership changes in the past and any such ownership change in the future could result in increased future tax liability. In addition, we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carry-forwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. 

If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired. 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. To satisfy this obligation, we expend significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. If any of these new or improved controls and systems do not perform as expected, we may experience material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our controls. Our controls may also become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. We may discover any such weaknesses or deficiencies in the future and be required to restate our financial statements for prior periods. 

Ineffective internal controls over financial reporting could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our periodic reports that are filed with the SEC. For example, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial and other information; we could fail to satisfy our SEC, Nasdaq other reporting obligations, or become subject to sanctions or investigations by regulators; and our the price of our Class A common stock could decline. 

Changes in existing financial accounting standards or practices, or taxation rules or practices, may harm our results of operations. 

Changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices, new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules, or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practice could harm our results of operations or the manner in which we conduct our business. Further, such changes could potentially affect our reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective. 

GAAP are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;), the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. Adoption of such new standards and any difficulties in implementation of changes in accounting principles, including the ability to modify our accounting systems, could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could result in regulatory discipline and harm investors&#8217; confidence in us. 

If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could be adversely affected. 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the section titled &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to those referenced in the section titled &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; Our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our 

results of operations to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our Class A common stock. 

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock 

The stock price of our Class A common stock may be volatile or may decline. 

The trading price of our Class A common stock has been, and in the future, may be, subject to substantial volatility and wide fluctuations. For example, from February 1, 2024 through January 31, 2025, the trading price of our Class A common stock has ranged from $70.56 per share to $114.50 per share. The market price of our Class A common stock fluctuates significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the factors described elsewhere in these risk factors, as well as: 

&#8226; overall performance of the equity markets and/or publicly-listed technology companies; 

&#8226; volatility in the market prices and trading volumes of technology and high-growth companies generally, or those in our industry in particular; 

&#8226; actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue or other financial or operating metrics; 

&#8226; our ability to meet or exceed forward-looking guidance we have given, our ability to give forward-looking guidance consistent with past practices, and changes to or withdrawal of previous guidance or long-range targets; 

&#8226; failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates and/or recommendations by any securities analysts who follow our company; 

&#8226; our failure to meet the estimates or the expectations of securities analysts or investors; 

&#8226; actions and investment positions taken by institutional and other stockholders, including activist investors; 

&#8226; recruitment or departure of key personnel; 

&#8226; rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry; 

&#8226; announcements by us or our competitors of significant innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments; and 

&#8226; sales of additional shares of our Class A common stock by us, our directors, our officers or our stockholders. 

In addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. Stock prices of many companies, including technology companies and high-growth, unprofitable companies in particular, have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. Our involvement in securities litigation has, in the past, and could, in the future, subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and harm our business. 

The dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our capital stock prior to the completion of our IPO, including our directors, executive officers, and their affiliates, who held in the aggregate 35.3% of the voting power of our capital stock as of January 31, 2025. This will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval. 

Our Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of January 31, 2025, our directors, executive officers and their affiliates held in the aggregate 35.3% of the voting power of our capital stock, taking into account shares of our common stock subject to options that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of January 31, 2025 and RSUs that are releasable within 60 days of January 31, 2025. Because of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the 

holders of our Class B common stock collectively could continue to control nearly a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and be able to effectively control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval until April 12, 2027, the date that is the ten-year anniversary of the closing of our IPO. This concentrated control may limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval. In addition, this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders. 

Future transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who have retained their shares. 

Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock in the public markets, or the perception that sales might occur, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline. 

Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock into the public market, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders, or the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline. 

In addition, we have options outstanding that, if fully exercised, would result in the issuance of shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. We also have restricted stock units (&#8220;RSUs&#8221;) outstanding that, if vested and settled, would result in the issuance of shares of Class A common stock. All of the shares of Class A and Class B common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options and vesting of RSUs and the shares reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans, are registered for public resale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (&#8220;Securities Act&#8221;). Accordingly, these shares will be able to be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to applicable vesting requirements. 

Furthermore, a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock is reserved for issuance upon the exercise of the Notes (as defined below). If we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation on the Notes solely in shares of our Class A common stock upon conversion of the Notes, we will be required to deliver the shares of our Class A common stock, together with cash for any fractional share, on the second business day following the relevant conversion date. 

If securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, the price of our Class A common stock and trading volume could decline. 

The trading market for our Class A common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research on our company, the trading price for our Class A common stock would be negatively affected. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our Class A common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our Class A common stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us on a regular basis, demand for our Class A common stock could decrease, which might cause our Class A common stock price and trading volume to decline. 

We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. 

We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the operation of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their Class A common 

stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. 

Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current board of directors, and limit the market price of our Class A common stock. 

Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that: 

&#8226; provide that our board is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms; 

&#8226; permit our board to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly-created directorships; 

&#8226; require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws; 

&#8226; authorize the issuance of &#8220;blank check&#8221; preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan; 

&#8226; provide that only the Chairperson of our board, our Chief Executive Officer, or a majority of our board of directors are authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders; 

&#8226; provide for a dual class common stock structure in which holders of our Class B common stock have the ability to effectively control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets; 

&#8226; prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; 

&#8226; provide that our board is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and 

&#8226; advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. 

Moreover, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations, and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock. 

Our amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit stockholders&#8217; ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us. 

Our amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for: 

&#8226; any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; 

&#8226; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; 

&#8226; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws; or 

&#8226; any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. 

This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder&#8217;s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur 

additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Risks Related to our Outstanding Convertible Notes 

Servicing our debt may require a significant amount of cash. We may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness. 

We have issued convertible notes due in 2025 (&#8220;2025 Notes&#8221;) and 2026 (&#8220;2026 Notes&#8221; and together with the 2025 Notes, the &#8220;Notes&#8221;). Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance or raise any future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. In addition, any of our future debt agreements may contain restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of our debt. 

We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary for cash settlement upon conversion of the Notes or to repurchase the Notes for cash upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion of the Notes or to repurchase the Notes. 

Holders of the Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indentures governing their respective Notes) at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Upon conversion of the Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our Class A common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Notes being converted. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Notes surrendered or Notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture governing such notes or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Notes as required by such indenture would constitute a default under such indenture. A default under the indenture governing the Notes or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon conversions. 

In addition, our indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have other important consequences. For example, it could: 

&#8226; make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general U.S. and worldwide economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; 

&#8226; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; 

&#8226; place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt; 

&#8226; limit our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund acquisitions, for working capital and for other general corporate purposes; and 

&#8226; make an acquisition of our company less attractive or more difficult. 

Any of these factors could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to our business and our ability to service or repay our indebtedness would increase. 

The conversion features of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

In the event the conditional conversion features of the 2025 Notes and the 2026 Notes are triggered, holders of the Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes, as applicable, at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our Class A common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. The conditional conversion features of the 2025 Notes were triggered as of January 31, 2021 and the 2025 Notes were convertible at the option of the holders between February 1, 2021 and April 30, 2021; however, as of January 31, 2025, the conditions allowing holders of the 2025 Notes to convert were not met. From the date of issuance through January 31, 2025, the conditions allowing holders of the 2026 Notes to convert were not met. 

In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital and could limit our ability to raise future capital. As of January 31, 2025, the 2025 Notes have been classified as a current liability on our balance sheet due to their upcoming maturity on September 1, 2025. 

Transactions relating to our Notes may affect the value of our Class A common stock. 

The conversion of some or all of the Notes would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering shares of our Class A common stock upon any conversion of such Notes. Our 2025 Notes and 2026 Notes may become in the future convertible at the option of their holders under certain circumstances. If holders of our Notes elect to convert their notes, we may settle our conversion obligation by delivering to them a significant number of shares of our Class A common stock, which would cause dilution to our existing stockholders. We have in the past, and may in the future, engage in exchanges, repurchase, or induce conversions of the Notes. Holders of the Notes that participate in any of these exchanges, repurchases, or induced conversions may enter into or unwind various derivatives with respect to our Class A common stock or sell shares of our Class A common stock in the open market to hedge their exposure in connection with these transactions. These activities could decrease (or reduce the size of any increase in) the market price of our Class A common stock or the Notes, or dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. In addition, the market price of our Class A common stock is likely to be affected by short sales of our Class A common stock or the entry into or unwind of economically equivalent derivative transactions with respect to our Class A common stock by investors that do not participate in the exchange transactions and by the hedging activity of the counterparties to our capped call transactions (""Capped Calls"") or their respective affiliates. 

In addition, in connection with the issuance of the 2025 Notes and 2026 Notes, we entered into Capped Calls with certain financial institutions (the &#8220;Option Counterparties&#8221;). The Capped Calls are generally expected to reduce potential dilution to our Class A common stock upon any conversion or settlement of the 2025 Notes and 2026 Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 2025 Notes and 2026 Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. If we unwind the Capped Calls in connection with Note repurchases or otherwise, we would lose the anti-dilutive impact of any unwound Capped Calls. 

From time to time, the Option Counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our Class A common stock and/or purchasing or selling our Class A common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Notes. This activity could cause a decrease in the market price of our Class A common stock. 

General Risk Factors 

We depend on our executive officers and other key employees, and the loss of one or more of these employees or an inability to attract and retain other highly skilled employees could harm our business. 

Our success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key employees. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. We do not have employment agreements with our executive officers or other key personnel that require them to continue to work for us for any specified period and they could terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees, and any failure to have in place and 

execute an effective succession plan for key executives, could harm our business. In addition, to execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for these personnel in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters is located, and in other locations where we maintain offices, is intense, especially for engineers experienced in designing and developing software and SaaS applications and experienced sales professionals. We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications, and may not be able to fill positions in the desired regions, or at all. Our efforts to attract new personnel may be compounded by intensified restriction on travel, changes to immigration policy or the availability of work visas. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be harmed. 

Catastrophic events may disrupt our business. 

Natural disasters or other catastrophic events may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy, and thus could harm our business. We have a large employee presence in San Francisco, California, and the west coast of the United States contains active earthquake and wildfire zones which have the potential to disrupt our business. Communications systems and infrastructure could be damaged or interrupted at any time due to a major catastrophic event such as an earthquake, hurricane, fire or flood; power loss or a telecommunications failure; an unauthorized or malicious act such as a cyber-attack, war or terrorist attack; a health epidemic, or similar events or disruptions. Such events could result in reputational harm, delays in our application development, breaches of data security and loss of critical data. While we have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations, disaster recovery planning by its nature cannot be sufficient for all eventualities. In addition, the insurance we maintain may be insufficient to compensate for losses from a major interruption.

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to include risk factors in this Annual Report. For the complete list of risks relating to our Company and our operations, see the section titled &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; contained in our prospectus filed with the SEC on December 3, 2021. However, below is a partial list of material risks, uncertainties and other factors that could have a material effect on our Company and our operations:

##TABLE_START &#9679; we are an early stage Company with no revenue or basis to evaluate our ability to select a suitable business target; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; we may not be able to select an appropriate target business or businesses and complete our initial business combination in the prescribed time frame; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; our expectations around the performance of a prospective target business or businesses may not be realized; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; we may not be successful in retaining or recruiting required officers, key employees or directors following our initial business combination; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; our officers and directors may have difficulties allocating their time between the Company and other businesses and may potentially have conflicts of interest with our business or in approving our initial business combination; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; we may not obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination or reduce the number of shareholders requesting redemption; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; you may not be given the opportunity to choose the initial business combination target or to vote on the initial business combination; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; trust account funds may not be protected against third party claims or bankruptcy; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; an active market for our public securities may not develop and you will have limited liquidity and trading; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; the availability to us of funds from interest income on the trust account balance may be insufficient to operate our business prior to our initial business combination; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; our financial performance following a business combination with an entity may be negatively affected by their lack of an established record of revenue, cash flows, earnings and experienced management. ##TABLE_END 

Changes in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results of operations. 

We are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, we will be required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements and numerous complex tax laws. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results of operations.

On January 24, 2024, the SEC adopted a series of new rules relating to SPACs (the &#8220;SPAC Rules&#8221;) requiring, among other items, (i) additional disclosures relating to SPAC business combination transactions; (ii) additional disclosures relating to dilution and to conflicts of interest involving sponsors and their affiliates in both SPAC initial public offerings and de-SPAC transactions; (iii) the use of projections by SPACs in SEC filings in connection with proposed business combination transactions; and (iv) both the SPAC and the target company&#8217;s status as co-registrants on de-SPAC registration statements.

In addition, the SEC&#8217;s adopting release provided guidance describing circumstances in which a SPAC could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act, including its duration, asset composition, business purpose, and the activities of the SPAC and its management team in furtherance of such goals.

Compliance with the SPAC Rules and related guidance may increase the costs of and the time needed to negotiate and complete an initial business combination and may constrain the circumstances under which we could complete an initial business combination.

If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. 

As described in the risk factor above entitled &#8220; Changes in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial business combination, and results of operations ,&#8221; the SEC&#8217;s adopting release with respect to the SPAC Rules provided guidance describing the extent to which SPACs could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act and the regulations thereunder. Whether a SPAC is an investment company will be a question of facts and circumstances. If our facts and circumstances change over time, we will update our disclosure to reflect how those changes impact the risk that we may be considered to be operating as an unregistered investment company. We can give no assurance that a claim will not be made that we have been operating as an unregistered investment company.

If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may have to change our operations, wind down our operations, or register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Our activities may be restricted, including:

##TABLE_START &#9679; restrictions on the nature of our investments; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; restrictions on the issuance of securities, each of which may make it difficult for us to complete our initial business combination. ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; In addition, we may have imposed upon us burdensome requirements, including: ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; registration as an investment company; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; adoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations. ##TABLE_END 

In order not to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, unless we can qualify for an exclusion, we must ensure that we are engaged primarily in a business other than investing, reinvesting or trading in securities and that our activities do not include investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading &#8220;investment securities&#8221; constituting more than 40% of our total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Our business will be to identify and complete a business combination and thereafter to operate the post-transaction business or assets for the long term. We do not intend to spend a considerable amount of time actively managing the assets in the trust account for the primary purpose of achieving investment returns. We do not plan to buy businesses or assets with a view to resale or profit from their resale. We do not plan to buy unrelated businesses or assets or to be a passive investor.

We do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to the Investment Company Act. To this end, the proceeds held in the trust account have only been held as cash, including in demand deposit accounts at a bank, or invested in U.S. &#8220;government securities&#8221; within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations; the holding of these assets in this form is intended to be temporary and for the sole purpose of facilitating the intended business combination and may at any time be held as cash or cash items, including in demand deposit accounts at a bank. Pursuant to the trust agreement, the trustee is not permitted to invest in other securities or assets. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, and by having a business plan targeted at acquiring and growing businesses for the long term (rather than on buying and selling businesses in the manner of a merchant bank or private equity fund), we intend to avoid being deemed an &#8220;investment company&#8221; within the meaning of the Investment Company Act. An investment in our securities is not intended for persons who are seeking a return on investments in government securities or investment securities. The trust account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earliest to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business combination; (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with an amendment of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide for the redemption of our public shares in connection with an initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated our initial business combination within the completion window or (B) with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders&#8217; rights or pre-initial business combination activity; or (iii) absent an initial business combination within the completion window, our return of the funds held in the trust account to our public shareholders as part of our redemption of the public shares. If we do not invest the proceeds as discussed above, we may be deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act.

Further, under the subjective test of a &#8220;investment company&#8221; pursuant to Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act, even if the funds deposited in the trust account were invested in the assets discussed above (U.S. government securities or money market funds registered under the Investment Company Act), such assets, other than cash, are &#8220;securities&#8221; for purposes of the Investment Company Act and, therefore, nevertheless, there is a risk that we could be deemed an unregistered investment company and subject to the Investment Company Act at any time.

In the adopting release for the SPAC Rules, the SEC provided guidance that a SPAC&#8217;s potential status as an &#8220;investment company&#8221; depends on a variety of factors, such as a SPAC&#8217;s duration, asset composition, business purpose and activities and &#8220;is a question of facts and circumstances&#8221; requiring individualized analysis. If we were deemed to be an unregistered investment company and subject to compliance with and regulation under the Investment Company Act, we would be subject to additional regulatory burdens and expenses for which we have not allotted funds. Unless we are able to modify our activities so that we would not be deemed an investment company, we would either register as an investment company or wind-down and abandon our efforts to complete a business combination and instead liquidate the trust account. As a result, our public shareholders may only receive their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account that are available for distribution to public shareholders and would be unable to realize the potential benefits of an initial business combination, including the possible appreciation of the combined company&#8217;s securities.

To mitigate the risk that we might be deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act, we may, at any time, instruct the trustee to liquidate the securities held in the trust account and instead to hold the funds in the trust account in cash until the earlier of the consummation of our initial business combination or our liquidation. As a result, following the liquidation of securities in the trust account, the interest earned, on the funds held in the trust account may be materially reduced, which would reduce the dollar amount our public shareholders would receive upon any redemption or liquidation of the Company. 

Since our IPO, we have held the funds in the trust account as cash, including in demand deposit accounts at a bank, or in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in U.S. government treasury obligations and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. U.S. government treasury obligations are considered &#8220;securities&#8221; for purposes of the Investment Company Act, while cash is not. As noted above, one of the factors the SEC identified as relevant to the determination of whether a SPAC which holds securities could potentially be deemed an &#8220;investment company&#8221; under the Investment Company Act is the SPAC&#8217;s duration. To mitigate the risk of us being deemed to be an unregistered investment company (including under the subjective test of Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act) and thus subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act, we may, at any time, instruct Continental Stock Transfer &#38; Trust Company, the trustee with respect to the trust account, to liquidate the U.S. government treasury obligations or money market funds held in the trust account and thereafter to hold all funds in the trust account in cash until the earlier of consummation of our initial business combination or liquidation of the company. Following such liquidation, the rate of interest we receive on the funds held in the trust account may be materially decreased. However, interest previously earned on the funds held in the trust account still may be released to us for permitted withdrawals and certain other expenses as permitted. As a result, any decision to liquidate the securities held in the trust account and thereafter to hold all funds in the trust account in cash would reduce the dollar amount our public shareholders would receive upon any redemption or liquidation of the company.

We expect to incur significant transaction and transition costs in connection with our initial business combination. If we fail to consummate a business combination, we may not have sufficient cash available to pay such costs. 

We expect to incur significant, non-recurring costs in connection with consummating our initial business combination. Some of these costs are payable regardless of whether the business combination is completed. Our transaction expenses in connection with completing our initial business combination are currently estimated to be approximately $14.5 million. There may be other costs which have to be incurred. We do not currently have sufficient cash available to pay all of these fees and expenses and will likely not have sufficient cash to pay unless and until we complete an initial business combination transaction.

Cyber incidents or attacks directed at us or third parties could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss. 

We face a multitude of cybersecurity threats, have experienced, and will continue to experience, cyber incidents in the normal course of business. Such cybersecurity threats could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operations, results of operations, performance, cash flows or reputation. We depend on digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications and services, including those of third parties with which we may deal. Our service providers (including the transfer agent), and other business contacts may face similar cybersecurity threats, and a cybersecurity incident impacting these persons or entities could materially adversely affect our operations, performance and results of operations. Sophisticated and deliberate attacks on, or security breaches in, the systems or infrastructure or the cloud that we utilize, including those of third parties, could lead to corruption or misappropriation of our assets, proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data. As an early-stage company without significant investments in data security protection, we may not be sufficiently protected against such occurrences. We also lack sufficient resources to adequately protect against, or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to, cyber incidents. It is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have material adverse consequences on our business and lead to financial loss.

&#8203; 

Since our securities are no longer traded on a national securities exchange, our securities will in all likelihood be thinly traded and as a result you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all if you need to liquidate your securities. 

On December 9, 2024, Nasdaq suspended the trading of our units, Class A ordinary shares and public warrants. Following the suspension, our securities began trading on the over-the-counter market and are listed on the OTC Pink tier of the OTC Marketplace under the symbols &#8220;TLGYU,&#8221; &#8220;TLGY&#8221; and &#8220;TLGYW,&#8221; respectively. As a result, we may face significant material adverse consequences, including:

##TABLE_START &#9679; a limited availability of market quotations for our securities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; reduced liquidity for our securities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; a determination that our Class A ordinary shares are a &#8220;penny stock&#8221; which will require brokers trading in our Class A ordinary shares to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities; ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and ##TABLE_END##TABLE_START &#9679; a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. ##TABLE_END 

We cannot give you any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our securities will develop or be sustained, or that any trading levels will be sustained.

The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements (see &#8220;Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Information&#8221; ). These risk factors are important to understanding other statements in this Report. The following information should be read in conjunction with &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Item 7 and &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; in Item 8, which may include additional factors that could adversely affect our business. References to &#8220;Notes&#8221; relate to the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements (&#8220;Financial Statements&#8221;) in Item 8. 

Our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity and stock price may be affected materially and adversely, in whole or in part, by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause our actual financial condition, operating results, cash flows and liquidity to vary materially from historical results or those anticipated, projected or assumed in our forward-looking statements. Further, new risks emerge from time to time. In addition, our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity and stock price could be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies generally which are not specifically mentioned below. 

&#160; 

Business and Industry Risks 

Our revenue and profitability continues to be dependent on the offshore oil and gas industry, which is a historically cyclical industry. 

Our business continues to be dependent on the level of capital expenditures by oil and gas producers, processors and their contractors, as well as alternative energy companies, operating in the GOA and along the Gulf Coast. The level of capital expenditures by these companies can be impacted by oil and gas and associated commodity prices. In recent years, the price of oil and gas has experienced significant volatility, which resulted in reductions in capital spending and drilling activities from our traditional offshore oil and gas customer base. Consequently, our operating results and cash flows were negatively impacted from reductions in revenue, lower margins due to competitive pricing, and under-utilization of our operating facilities and resources. Although oil and gas prices have recovered, due in part to geopolitical conflicts, from their historic lows, there are no assurances that current prices will be sustained or that our business will continue to benefit from the relative increase in prices. 

In addition to commodity prices, the levels of our customers&#8217; capital expenditures are influenced by, among other things: 

&#8226; availability and cost of capital; 

&#8226; the cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas, and the sufficiency of any returns on capital investments; 

&#8226; the sale and expiration dates of offshore leases in the U.S. and overseas; 

&#8226; the discovery rate, size and location of new oil and gas reserves; 

&#8226; demand for energy, including hydrocarbon production, which is affected by worldwide economic activity and uncertainty and population growth, as well as geopolitical conflicts; 

&#8226; the ability of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (&#8220;OPEC&#8221;) to set and maintain production levels for oil and the level of production by non-OPEC countries; 

&#8226; political events and conditions, including socio-political unrest, any government shutdown, instability or hostilities, and trade and monetary sanctions in response to such developments; 

&#8226; demand for, availability of and technological viability of, alternative sources of energy; 

&#8226; technological advances affecting energy exploration, production, transportation and consumption; and 

&#8226; weather conditions, natural disasters, and global or regional public health crises and other catastrophic events. 

We are unable to predict future oil and gas prices or the level of oil and gas industry activity for the services we provide. Further, the current relative stabilization in oil and gas prices and increase in bidding activity may not necessarily translate into long-term increased activity. Even during periods of relatively high oil and gas prices, our customers may cancel or curtail capital expenditure programs for exploration and production and repair and maintenance of their offshore assets due to uncertainty regarding the continued relative stability of oil and gas prices and other priorities for cash flows, including investment in energy transition projects. Advances in onshore exploration and development technologies, or energy transition projects, could result in our historical customers allocating a higher percentage of their capital expenditure budgets to such activities and we may not be successful securing new project awards related to these activities. See risk factor below titled &#8220;Our efforts to strategically reposition the Company to diversify our service offerings and customer base may not result in increased shareholder value.&#8221; In addition, an increase in gas prices could also negatively impact future investments in petrochemical and other facilities that benefit from lower gas prices. These factors could cause our revenue and margins to be depressed and limit our future growth opportunities. See Note 1 and &#8220;Impacts of Oil and Gas Price Volatility and Macroeconomic Conditions on Operations&#8221; in Item 7 for further discussion of the impacts of oil and gas price volatility. 

The impacts on our business of the volatility of oil and gas prices and other factors that have influenced our customers&#8217; capital spending have included, or may continue to include, among other things, reduced bidding activity; suspension or termination of backlog; deterioration of customer financial condition; and unanticipated project costs and schedule delays due to supply chain disruptions, labor and material price increases, lower labor productivity, increased employee and contractor absenteeism and turnover, craft labor hiring challenges, increased safety incidents, lack of performance by subcontractors and suppliers, and contract disputes. 

&#160; 

We service industries that are highly competitive among service providers. 

The onshore refining, petrochemical, LNG and industrial fabrication industries and the offshore oil and gas fabrication and services industry are highly competitive and influenced by events largely outside of our control. In addition, as we seek fabrication opportunities related to other industries (such as energy transition initiatives, including in support of our customers who are making energy transitions away from fossil fuels, opportunities related to offshore wind developments and potential future onshore support structures to provide electricity from renewable and green sources) we may face increased competition. Contracts for our fabrication and services projects are often awarded on a competitively bid basis and our customers consider many factors when awarding a project. These factors include price, ability to meet the customer&#8217;s schedule, the availability and capacity of personnel, equipment and facilities, and the reputation, experience and safety record of the contractor. We can provide no assurances that we will be able to maintain our current competitive position in the industries we currently serve or that we will be able to successfully compete with companies in other industries (including as the green energy transition progresses). In addition, we often compete with companies that have greater resources or lower operating costs, which may make them more competitive for certain projects. 

Competition with foreign fabricators can also be challenging as such competitors often have lower operating costs and lower wage rates, and foreign governments often use subsidies and incentives to create local jobs and impose import duties and fees on products. In addition, technological innovations have lowered transportation costs, increasing the competitiveness of foreign competitors when exporting structures from foreign locations to the GOA and Gulf Coast, which may hinder our ability to successfully secure new awards for projects destined for the GOA and Gulf Coast from foreign locations. See &#8220;Competition&#8221; in Item 1 for further discussion of the competitive nature of our industry. 

A small number of customers typically represent a significant portion of our revenue. 

We derive a significant amount of our revenue from a small number of customers in any given year. For our Services Division, our services for such customers are generally subject to master services agreements that are subject to periodic renegotiation and renewal. Accordingly, the amount of revenue with a customer may vary between years depending on our successful renewal of the master services agreements and, among other things, the amount of that customer&#8217;s capital expenditure budget, our labor availability and our ability to meet the customer&#8217;s schedule requirements. For our Fabrication Division, our services for such customers are generally project specific, and accordingly, may account for a significant portion of our revenue in one year, but represent a smaller or even immaterial portion, if any, of our revenue in subsequent years, or vice-versa. We define significant customers as those that individually comprise 10% or more of our consolidated revenue. For 2024, two customers accounted for 51% of our consolidated revenue (one of which was also a significant customer in 2023), and for 2023, two customers accounted for 53% of our consolidated revenue (excluding the negative revenue charge associated with the resolution of our MPSV Litigation for our Shipyard Division). The loss of a significant customer in any given year for any reason, including a sustained decline in that customer&#8217;s capital expenditure budget or competitive factors, could result in a substantial loss of revenue. See &#8220;Customers&#8221; in Item 1 for further discussion of our customers. 

Competitive pricing common in the industries we serve could negatively impact our operating results. 

We have not always been successful in fully recovering our project and overhead costs or realizing a profit, even when industry conditions are favorable, due in part to the competitive environment for new project awards. While we have recently experienced an increase in bidding activity for fabrication projects and demand for our services remains strong, this trend may not continue. Additionally, as it relates to our fabrication business, during periods of increased market demand, new fabrication capacity may enter the market, which could place additional pressure on the pricing of our fabrication projects. Furthermore, during periods of declining pricing for our services and fabrication projects, we may not be able to reduce our costs accordingly, which could impact our ability to compete. 

Operational Risks 

Our business depends on the award of new contracts and the timing and execution of such contracts. 

It is difficult to predict whether or when we will be awarded new contracts due to complex bidding and selection processes, changes in existing or forecasted market conditions, governmental regulations, permitting and environmental matters. In the case of our Fabrication Division, while we have seen an increase in bidding activities for large project opportunities, we can provide no assurances that the higher level of bidding activity will continue during 2025 and beyond or that we will be successful in securing any large project awards. Our results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate materially from period to period based on our success in securing new project awards. 

&#160; 

Our short-term profitability may be affected from time to time as we balance our current capacity with expectations of future project awards and the timing of execution of new project awards. If an expected new project award is delayed or not received, or project execution is delayed subsequent to an award, we may incur costs to maintain an idle workforce and facilities, or alternatively, we may determine that our long-term interests are best served by reducing our workforce and incurring increased costs associated with termination benefits, both of which we have experienced in the past. See &#8220;Other Impacts to Operations&#8221; in Item 7 for discussion of a project cancellation during 2023. A reduction in our workforce could also impact our results of operations if customers are hesitant to award new contracts based upon our staffing levels or if we are unable to adequately increase our labor force and staff projects that are awarded following a workforce reduction. See the risk factor below titled &#8220;We may be unable to employ a sufficient number of skilled personnel to execute our projects&#8221; for further discussion of the impacts of labor constraints on our operations. 

The nature of our contracting terms for our contracts could adversely affect our operating results. 

A substantial number of our projects are performed on a fixed-price or unit-rate basis in any given year. Under fixed-price contracts, our contract price is fixed, and is generally only subject to adjustment for changes in scope by the customer. Accordingly, we retain cost savings realized on a project but are also responsible for cost overruns. Under unit-rate contracts, material items or labor tasks are assigned unit rates of measure. The unit rates of measure will generally be a reimbursable value per ton, per foot or square foot or per item installed. A typical unit-rate contract can contain hundreds to thousands of unit rates of measure. Profit margins are incorporated into the unit-rates and, similar to a fixed-price contract, we retain cost savings realized on a project but are also responsible for cost overruns. In many cases, our fixed-price and unit-rate contracts involve complex design and engineering, significant procurement of materials and equipment, and extensive project management. In addition, as projects increase or decrease in scope, the resulting changes in contract price or unit-rates could be less than the actual costs incurred associated with such changes in scope. We employ our best efforts to properly estimate the cost to complete our projects; however, our actual costs incurred could materially exceed our estimates. The revenue, costs and profit realized on a contract will often vary from the estimated amounts on which such contract was originally estimated due to the following: 

&#8226; unanticipated changes in, or failure to properly estimate the costs of, engineering, materials, components, equipment, labor or subcontractors; 

&#8226; increased costs due to poor project execution or productivity and/or weather conditions; 

&#8226; failure to properly estimate the impact of engineering delays or errors on the construction of a project, including productivity, schedule and rework; 

&#8226; difficulties in engaging third-party subcontractors, equipment manufacturers or materials suppliers, or failures by such third-parties to perform, resulting in project delays and additional costs; 

&#8226; late delivery of materials by vendors or the inability of subcontractors to deliver contracted services on schedule or at the agreed upon price; 

&#8226; unanticipated costs or claims, including costs for project modifications, delays, errors or changes in specifications or designs, regulatory changes or contract termination; 

&#8226; unrecoverable costs associated with customer changes in scope and schedule; 

&#8226; payment of liquidated damages due to a failure to meet contractual delivery dates; 

&#8226; changes in labor conditions, including the availability, wage and productivity of labor; 

&#8226; termination, temporary suspension or significant reduction in scope of our projects by our customers; 

&#8226; unanticipated technical problems with the structures, equipment or systems we supply; 

&#8226; unforeseen costs or delays related to equipment that is not operable or does not adequately function; and 

&#8226; under-utilization of our facilities and an idle labor force. 

These variations and risks are inherent within our industry and may result in revenue and profit that differ from amounts originally estimated or result in losses on projects. Depending on the size and duration of a project, variations from estimated contract performance can have a significant impact on our operating results. In addition, substantially all of our contracts require us to continue work in accordance with the contractually agreed schedule, and thus, continue to incur expenses for labor and materials, notwithstanding the occurrence of a disagreement with a customer over changes in scope, increased pricing and/or unresolved change orders or claims. 

&#160; 

We could be exposed to potentially significant liability and costs due to limits on our insurance coverage and losses for which we do not have third-party insurance coverage. 

The fabrication of structures and the services we provide involves operating hazards that can cause accidents, resulting in personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, and suspension of operations. 

In addition, due to the proximity to the GOA, our facilities are subject to the possibility of physical damage caused by hurricanes or flooding. For example, our Houma Facilities have experienced damage from hurricane activity in the past, and during 2024, Hurricane Francine made landfall near our Houma Facilities. While we did not experience any significant damage to our Houma Facilities or equipment, our Fabrication Division operations were temporarily suspended due to pre-storm preparation activities and post-storm power outages. See the risk factor below titled &#8220;We are susceptible to adverse weather conditions in our market areas&#8221; for further discussion of the impacts of adverse weather conditions to our operations. 

Further, our employees may engage in certain activities that are covered by the provisions of the Jones Act or USL&#38;H, including services conducted on offshore platforms, activities performed on barges owned or chartered by us, and certain fabrication activities performed at our Houma Facilities. These laws make the liability limits established under state workers&#8217; compensation laws inapplicable to these employees and, instead, permit them or their representatives to pursue actions against us for damages or job-related injuries, with generally no limitations on our potential liability. Our ownership and operation of vessels can also give rise to large and varied liability risks, such as risks of collisions with other vessels or structures, sinking, fires and other marine casualties, which can result in significant claims for damages against both us and third parties. Litigation arising from any such occurrences may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims. 

We may be exposed to future losses through our use of deductibles and retentions for our exposures related to property and equipment damage, builder&#8217;s risk, third-party liability and workers&#8217; compensation and USL&#38;H claims. For any such exposures, we will rely on existing liquidity and cash flows to meet obligations that would arise from an incident or series of events. The occurrence of a significant incident, series of events, or unforeseen liability for which we are uninsured or not fully insured, or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 

There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable or that our insurance coverages will be adequate to cover claims that may arise. Changes in the insurance industry have generally led to higher insurance costs and decreased availability of coverage. The availability of insurance that covers risks we typically insure against may decrease, and the insurance that we are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums and more restrictive policy terms. During 2024 and 2023, we reviewed our insurance coverage options for our property and equipment and determined that the benefits of such coverage were outweighed by coverage limitations and high premiums and deductibles. Accordingly, we are generally uninsured for exposures resulting from any future damage to our property and equipment. To the extent we are uninsured, reserves are recorded based upon our estimates, with input from legal and insurance advisors. Changes in assumptions, as well as changes in actual experience, could cause these estimates to change. See Note 7 and &#8220;Insurance&#8221; in Item 1 for further discussion of our insurance coverages. 

Our project execution and operations may be negatively affected if our equipment is not operable or does not adequately function. 

Our project execution and operations are heavily dependent on the use of owned and leased equipment. Accordingly, equipment that is not operable or that does not adequately function could negatively impact our project execution and operations. As our equipment ages, the costs associated with maintaining such equipment typically increases, and in some instances, such equipment may require full replacement. In recent years, we have not made significant investments in new equipment or the refurbishment of owned equipment, and accordingly, future repair or replacement costs could be significantly higher than those recently experienced. Further, equipment that becomes non-operable or that does not properly function may result in the temporary suspension of our operations until the equipment is repaired or replaced, and such impacts may be compounded by limitations on the availability and timely receipt of replacement equipment or component parts. See the risk factor below titled &#8220; We depend on third parties to provide services and supply raw materials, equipment and components necessary to perform our contractual obligations, and any increase in the price or constraints on the supply of such raw materials, equipment or components could negatively affect our profitability &#8221; for discussion of the availability of equipment and component parts. 

&#160; 

Our backlog is subject to change as a result of delay, suspension, termination or an increase or decrease in scope for projects currently in backlog. 

The revenue projected in our backlog may not be realized or, if realized, may not be profitable. Projects included in our backlog are generally subject to delay, suspension, termination, or an increase or decrease in scope at the option of the customer. Depending on the size of the project, the delay, suspension, termination, or increase or decrease in scope of any project could significantly impact our backlog and change the expected amount and timing of revenue recognized. In addition, whether a project proceeds as scheduled, is suspended or terminated, it is possible that the customer may default by failing to pay amounts owed to us, including reimbursement to us for third-party costs we have committed or incurred on the customer&#8217;s behalf. Accordingly, our backlog as of any date is an uncertain indicator of future results of operations. See Note 2 and &#8220; New Project Awards and Backlog&#8221; in Item 7 for further discussion of our new project awards and backlog. 

We depend on third parties to provide services and supply raw materials, equipment and components necessary to perform our contractual obligations, and any increase in the price or constraints on the supply of such raw materials, equipment or components could negatively affect our profitability. 

The price and availability of the raw materials required to execute our projects are subject to volatility and disruptions caused by global economic factors that are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, wage pressures, rising inflation and potential economic slowdown or recession, increases in fuel and energy costs, the impact of natural disasters, public health crises, geopolitical conflicts, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and other matters that have or could impact the global economy. For example, the current administration in the U.S. has imposed tariffs on various raw materials imported into the U.S. which we use in our operations, including steel, which are currently set to become effective on March 12, 2025. New or increased tariffs imposed by the U.S. or other countries could increase our costs for imported raw materials, which may result in lower-than-expected profit margins on our projects or make us less competitive in our pursuit of new project opportunities. 

We rely on third parties to provide raw materials, equipment and components, and depend upon subcontractors for a variety of reasons, including performing work we would otherwise perform with our employees but are unable to do so as a result of scheduling demands, performing certain aspects of a contract more efficiently considering the conditions of the contract, and performing certain services that we are unable to do or which we believe can be performed at a lower cost by subcontractors. We have experienced supplier and subcontractor delays, which have negatively affected project results. See Note 2 for further discussion of the impacts of supplier and subcontractor delays on our projects. 

Ensuring continuity of supply of such raw materials to our operations is critical to our business. We also rely on the availability of equipment and components for key equipment from our suppliers, which may be impacted by competition demands as well as the availability of input materials in the creation of such equipment and components for key equipment. Failure of suppliers and subcontractors to deliver raw materials, equipment and components and provide services, or perform under their contracts on a timely basis, or at all, or our inability to obtain alternative sources of raw materials, equipment or components on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us, has had or may in the future have an adverse impact on our operations. The impact of global macroeconomics on our suppliers and subcontractors has resulted in, and may continue to result in, scheduling delays and higher costs, including as a result of inflation, for subcontracted services and raw materials, equipment and components. The inability of our suppliers or subcontractors to perform could result in the need to transition to alternative suppliers or subcontractors, which could result in significant incremental costs and delay, or the need for us to provide other supplemental means to support our existing suppliers and subcontractors. Disruptions and performance problems caused by our suppliers and subcontractors, or a misalignment between our contractual obligations to our customers and our agreements with our subcontractors and suppliers, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers. 

We may be protected from increases in material costs through cost escalation provisions in some of our contracts. However, the difference between our actual material costs and these escalation provisions may expose us to cost uncertainty. In addition, we may experience significant delays in deliveries of key raw materials, which may occur as a result of availability or price, including higher costs due to inflation. Delays and shortages of raw materials, equipment and components could continue in 2025, which may have an impact on other projects. See Note 2 for further discussion of the impacts of material delays on our projects. 

&#160; 

We may be unable to successfully defend against claims made against us by customers, subcontractors or other parties, or recover claims made by us against customers, subcontractors or other parties. 

We are, and may in the future become, involved in various legal proceedings and subject to other contingencies that have arisen or may arise in the ordinary course of our business. Our projects are generally complex, and we may encounter difficulties in design, engineering, schedule changes and other factors, some of which may be beyond our control, that affect our ability to complete projects in accordance with contractual delivery dates or to otherwise meet contractual performance obligations. 

We may bring claims against customers for additional costs incurred by us resulting from customer-caused delays or changes in project scope initiated by our customers that are not part of the original contract scope. In addition, claims may be brought against us by customers relating to, among other things, alleged defective or incomplete work, breaches of warranty and/or late completion of work. We may also have disputes with our subcontractors and other parties, related to, among other things, indemnification obligations. These claims may be subject to lengthy and/or expensive litigation or arbitration proceedings and may require us to invest significant working capital in projects to cover cost increases pending resolution of the claims. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain and adverse developments or outcomes can result in significant monetary damages, penalties, other sanctions or injunctive relief against us, limitations on our property rights, or regulatory interpretations that increase our operating costs, or when we bring the claim, less recovery than anticipated, if any. A material adverse outcome in any uninsured litigation could result in our liabilities exceeding our assets. See Notes 2 and 7 for discussion of our customer disputes. 

Regardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against or pursuing litigation or responding to investigations can be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations and distracting to management. In recognition of these considerations, we may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur or that we will not incur charges resulting from any such agreements or settlements. 

Systems and information technology interruption or failure and data security breaches could adversely impact our ability to operate or expose us to significant financial losses and reputational harm. 

We rely on computer information, communications technology and related systems in order to properly operate our business. From time to time, we experience occasional system interruptions and delays. In the event we are unable to deploy software and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and take other steps to maintain or improve the efficiency and efficacy of our systems, the operation of such systems could be interrupted or result in the loss, corruption or release of data. In addition, our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, force majeure events, telecommunications failures, power loss, acts of war or terrorism, physical or electronic security breaches, intentional or inadvertent user misuse or error, or similar events or disruptions. Any of these or other events could cause interruptions, delays, loss of critical and/or sensitive data or similar effects. 

In addition, we face the threat to our computer systems of unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, malicious code, organized cyber-attacks and other security problems and system disruptions. If we were to be subject to a cyber incident or attack, it could result in the disclosure of confidential or proprietary customer information, theft, loss, corruption or misappropriation of intellectual property, damage to our reputation with our customers and the market, failure to meet customer requirements or customer dissatisfaction, theft, exposure to litigation, damage to equipment and other financial costs and losses. We rely on industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain all confidential and proprietary information on our computer systems, but these systems are still vulnerable to such threats. In addition, as cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these system disruptions and security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these disruptions and breaches. See &#8220;Cybersecurity&#8221; in Item 1C for further discussion of our cybersecurity governance, risk management and strategy. 

We may conduct a portion of our operations through joint ventures and strategic alliances over which we may have limited control, and our partners in such arrangements may not perform. 

We may conduct a portion of our operations through joint ventures and strategic alliances with business partners. In any such arrangement, differences in views among the participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to reach agreement on certain matters, or to do so in a timely manner. In any joint venture or strategic alliance in which we hold a non-controlling interest, we may have limited control over many decisions relating to joint venture operations and internal controls relating to operations. We also cannot control the actions of our partners, including any non-performance, default, or bankruptcy of our partners, and we would likely share liability or have joint and/or several liability with our partners for joint venture matters. 

&#160; 

Major public health crises may have a negative impact on our operations. 

Pandemics, epidemics, widespread illness or other health crises, that interfere with the ability of our employees, suppliers, customers, financing sources or others to conduct business have and could adversely affect the global economy and our operations and business, including our backlog and bidding activities. Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions or other restrictions. For example, our operations (as well as the operations of our customers, subcontractors and other counterparties) were previously negatively impacted by the physical distancing, quarantine and isolation measures recommended by national, state and local authorities on large portions of the population, and mandatory business closures that were enacted in an attempt to control the spread of COVID-19, and which could be reenacted in response to any future major public health crisis (including any new and emerging strains and variants of COVID-19). 

Workforce Risks 

We may be unable to employ a sufficient number of skilled personnel to execute our projects. 

Our productivity and profitability are significantly dependent upon our ability to attract and retain skilled construction supervision and craft labor, primarily welders, pipe fitters and equipment operators. The fabrication and services industries have lost a significant number of experienced professionals over the years due to the aging of the workforce and the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry, which is attributable, among other reasons, to the volatility of oil and gas prices and a more generalized concern about the overall future prospects of the oil and gas industry. See risk factor above titled &#8220; Our revenue and profitability continues to be dependent on the offshore oil and gas industry, which is a historically cyclical industry. &#8221; Many companies, including us, have reduced their skilled workforce in the past in response to decreases in demand for our services. The current competitive labor market may make it more difficult to increase our labor force to desirable levels if we realize a significant increase in our new project awards or backlog. We cannot be certain that we will be able to attract and retain the qualified labor force required to meet current or future needs at a reasonable cost, or at all. 

With the recent increased demand for construction and services labor, the supply of skilled labor has become increasingly limited resulting in higher costs of labor, including increases in wage rates and the costs of recruiting and training to attract and retain qualified personnel, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, due to the higher demand for our services, if we cannot employ the necessary skilled labor to execute our backlog, we have had, and may in the future have, to increase our use of contract labor, which may have a higher cost and lower levels of productivity. 

If we are unable to hire and retain necessary skilled labor, we may be unable to secure new project awards, execute our backlog and expand our operations. Further, any shortage of skilled labor or ongoing challenges hiring and retaining skilled labor could negatively affect the quality, safety, timeliness and profitability of our projects. 

Our success is dependent on key personnel. 

Our success is dependent upon the abilities of our executives, management and other key employees who have significant and relevant industry experience. Our success also depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly-skilled personnel in various areas, including construction supervision, project management, procurement, project controls and finance. The loss of one or more key personnel or our inability to attract, retain and motivate necessary personnel could impact our operations. 

If we continue to have insufficient utilization levels for our facilities or resources, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected. 

In recent years we have experienced a partial under-utilization of our facilities and resources and have not fully recovered our overhead costs, due in part to the high fixed costs of our operations. This has resulted in losses from our operations in certain periods. If current or future facility and personnel capacity fails to match current or future customer demands for our services, our facilities and resources would continue to be under-utilized, which could result in less profitable operations or losses from our operations. 

Our employees and subcontractors work on projects that are inherently dangerous. If we fail to maintain safe work sites, we can be exposed to significant financial losses and reputational harm. 

We work on projects with large, mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, and dangerous processes, which can place our employees and subcontractors in challenging environments. We maintain a safety assurance program designed to ensure the safety of our employees and subcontractors and to ensure that we remain in compliance with all applicable federal and state mandated safety regulations. If our safety assurance program fails, our employees, subcontractors and others may become injured, disabled or lose their lives, and our projects may be delayed, causing exposure to litigation or investigations by regulators. 

&#160; 

Unsafe conditions at project work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover, increase project costs and increase our operating costs. In addition, our customers often require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid contracts. Our failure to maintain adequate safety standards could result in lost project awards and customers or preclude us from tendering future bids. 

Strategic Risks 

Our efforts to strategically reposition the Company to diversify our service offerings and customer base may not result in increased shareholder value. 

Our operations have historically been focused on fabrication and services for the offshore oil and gas industry. We have begun to diversify our business through the pursuit of onshore fabrication opportunities and sustainable energy and other projects that are not related to our traditional offshore oil and gas markets. During 2024, we made investments to expand our offshore services offering to include cleaning and environmental services, which provides flushing and removal of hydrocarbon residue from process equipment and piping on offshore facilities prior to the performance of maintenance, repair or decommissioning. Entry into, or further development of, new lines of business may expose us to risks that are different from those we have experienced historically. We may not be able to effectively manage these additional risks or implement successful business strategies and our cash flows derived from any new lines of business may not be consistent with our expectations or be insufficient to fully recover our investment. Additionally, our competitors in these expanded lines of business may possess greater operational knowledge, resources and experience than we do. These diversification initiatives may not increase shareholder value and could result in a reduction in shareholder value depending upon our required capital investment and success. 

Any future rationalization of under-utilized assets or facilities could result in future losses or impairments and may not produce our desired results. 

We may take actions to relocate assets, consolidate operations and rationalize under-utilized assets and facilities to improve our utilization. Such actions may include the sale of assets or the closure or consolidation of one or more of our facilities and the termination of facility employees. During 2024, we sold certain assets held for sale of our Fabrication Division that were no longer deemed necessary for such operations. A future sale of assets or facility closure or consolidation could result in impairments of facility assets and other restructuring or exits costs, including retention, severance or other costs associated with terminated personnel. Further, we can provide no assurances that any asset sales or facility closure or consolidation will result in an improvement in our overall utilization or that the costs of doing so will not exceed the benefits expected to be gained from the asset sales or closure or consolidation of a facility. In addition, any decisions made regarding our deployment or use of any sales proceeds we receive involves risks and uncertainties. As a result, our decisions with respect to such proceeds may not lead to increased long-term shareholder value. See Note 3 and &#8220; Other Impacts to Operations&#8221; in Item 7 for further discussion of our assets held for sale. 

We cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program or any other return of capital to our shareholders will enhance shareholder value, and share repurchases could affect the price of our common stock. 

Our Board of Directors (&#8220;Board&#8221;) has authorized the repurchase of up to $5.0 million of our outstanding common stock from time to time through a share repurchase program (&#8220;Share Repurchase Program&#8221;), effective through December 31, 2025, and we currently have remaining authorization to purchase up to $3.7 million of our outstanding common stock under the Share Repurchase Program. Under our Share Repurchase Program, we may make repurchases of stock through transactions in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or by other means in accordance with applicable laws. The timing and amount of any share repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program will be at the discretion of management and will depend on a variety of factors, including capital availability, our financial results, cash requirements, business, market, industry and global economic conditions, changes in laws, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by management. The Share Repurchase Program does not obligate us to repurchase any shares and may be modified, increased, suspended or terminated at any time at the discretion of the Board. A suspension or termination of our share repurchases could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock. In addition, as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the U.S. implemented a 1% excise tax on the value of certain stock repurchases by publicly traded companies. This tax could increase the costs to us of any share repurchases. 

There are a number of ways in which the Share Repurchase Program could fail to result in enhanced shareholder value. For example, any failure to repurchase stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our stock price. The existence of the Share Repurchase Program could also cause our stock price to trade higher than it otherwise would and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. The market price of our common stock could decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the effectiveness of the program. 

&#160; 

Additionally, repurchasing our common stock or any other return of capital to our shareholders will reduce the amount of cash and cash equivalents we have available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, capital preserving investments, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, and other general corporate purposes, and there are no guarantees that the Share Repurchase Program or any other return of capital to shareholders will result in increased shareholder value. See Note 8 and Item 5 for further discussion of our Share Repurchase Program. 

Financial Risks 

We may need additional capital in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, contract commitments and obligations, and/or strategic opportunities, and we may not be able to obtain or raise such capital (whether debt or equity) or do so on favorable terms, which would impair our ability to operate our business or execute our strategy. 

Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents and scheduled maturities of short-term investments. If such amounts and cash flows from operating activities are not sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures, contract commitments and obligations, and/or strategic opportunities, we would be required to reduce our capital expenditures and/or forego certain contracts and/or strategic opportunities, or we would be required to fund such needs through debt or equity issuances or through other financing alternatives, including credit arrangements or the sale of assets. Our ability to successfully raise capital (through debt or equity issuances) or obtain credit facilities in the future will depend in part upon prevailing capital market conditions, as well as our financial condition and operating results, and whether such additional capital is on terms that are satisfactory to us. 

We continue to be dependent on the oil and gas industry. See risk factor above titled &#8220; Our revenue and profitability continues to be dependent on the offshore oil and gas industry, which is a historically cyclical industry .&#8221; There are a number of potential negative consequences for the energy sector that may result if the volatility of oil and gas prices increases, oil and gas prices decline or oil and gas companies continue to de-prioritize investments in exploration, development and production, including the continued or worsening outflow of credit and capital from the energy sector and/or energy focused companies and further efforts by lenders to reduce their exposure to the energy sector, including the imposition of increased lending standards for the energy sector, higher borrowing costs and collateral requirements, or a refusal to extend new credit or amend existing credit facilities in the energy sector. These potential negative consequences may be exacerbated by the pressure exerted on financial institutions by regulatory agencies to respond quickly and decisively to credit risk that develops in distressed industries. All of these factors may complicate our ability to achieve a favorable outcome in obtaining debt financing or credit facilities. 

In order to secure debt financing or credit facilities with borrowing capacity, if available, we may be required to provide significant collateral, pay high interest rates and otherwise agree to restrictive terms. Collateral requirements and higher borrowing costs may limit our long- and short-term financial flexibility, and any failure to secure debt financing or credit facilities on terms that are acceptable to us could jeopardize our ability to fund, among other things, capital expenditures and general working capital needs or meet our other financial commitments. See Note 4 and &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; in Item 7 for discussion of the Note Agreement and Mortgage Agreement. 

If adequate capital is not available, or not available on beneficial terms, we may not be able to make future investments, take advantage of strategic opportunities, or respond to competitive challenges. Further, this could limit our ability to bid on new project opportunities, thereby limiting our potential growth and profitability. 

We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations. 

Our ability to fund operations depends on our ability to generate future cash flows from operations. This, to a large extent, is subject to conditions in the oil and gas industry, including commodity prices, demand for our services and the prices we are able to charge for our services, general economic and financial conditions, competition in the markets in which we operate, the impact of legislative and regulatory actions on how we conduct our business and other factors, all of which are beyond our control. See &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; in Item 7 for further discussion of our business outlook, and the risk factor above titled &#8220; Our revenue and profitability continues to be dependent on the offshore oil and gas industry, which is a historically cyclical industry .&#8221; 

In July 2021, we received forgiveness of $8.9 million of our Paycheck Protection Loan (&#8220;PPP Loan&#8221;) received in 2020. However, the Company remains subject to review and audit by the Small Business Administration (&#8220;SBA&#8221;) for a period of six years after forgiveness. While we believe we met the eligibility requirements for the PPP Loan, and used the loan proceeds in accordance with the PPP Loan forgiveness requirements, we can provide no assurances that any potential SBA review or audit will verify the amount forgiven, in whole or in part. If we are later determined to have been ineligible to receive the PPP Loan or PPP Loan forgiveness, we may be subject to significant penalties, including significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, and we could be required to repay the loan in its entirety, which could negatively impact our financial condition, and have an adverse impact on our reputation. 

&#160; 

We may not be able to obtain letters of credit or surety bonds if and when needed on favorable terms, if at all, and we may not have sufficient liquidity to satisfy any indemnification obligations owed to a surety should the surety have to make payments under the performance bonds to the beneficiary thereof. 

Certain of our projects require that we issue letters of credit or surety bonds to our customers in order to secure advance payments or guarantee performance under our contracts. Our LC Facility currently provides for letters of credit, which are subject to cash securitization. With respect to letters of credit under our LC Facility, any advance in the event of non-performance under a contract would become a direct obligation and reduction in our cash. With respect to surety bonds, payments by the Surety pursuant to a bond in the event of non-performance are subject to reimbursement to the Surety by us under a general indemnity agreement. Such indemnification obligations may include the face amount of the surety bond, or portions thereof, as well as other reimbursable items such as interest and certain investigative expenses and legal fees of the Surety. Such indemnification obligations would require us to use our cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments, and we may not have sufficient liquidity to satisfy such indemnification obligations. When a contract is complete, the contingent obligation terminates, and letters of credit or surety bonds are returned. In recent years it has been difficult to obtain letters of credit and bonding capacity, and identify potential financing sources, due to losses resulting from our Shipyard Division operations. We can provide no assurances that necessary letters of credit or bonding capacity will be available to support future project requirements or that we will have sufficient liquidity to satisfy any future indemnification obligations. See Note 4 and &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; in Item 7 for further discussion of our LC Facility and surety bonds. 

We are exposed to the credit risks of our customers, including nonpayment and nonperformance by our customers. 

The oil and gas industry continues to face significant challenges due to the volatility in the price of oil and gas, which has persisted over a decade. The concentration of our customers in the oil and gas industry may impact our overall exposure to credit risk as customers may be similarly affected by negative changes in industry conditions. We believe certain of our customers finance their activities through cash flows from operations and debt or equity financing. Many of these customers have faced significant challenges for over a decade due to the volatility in the price of oil and gas, including decreased cash flows, reductions in borrowing capacity, the inability to access capital or credit markets, and reductions in liquidity. While the prices of oil and gas have somewhat stabilized, the duration of such stability is uncertain and difficult to predict. If the price of oil and gas significantly declines or the returns on capital investments by our customers are insufficient, our operations could be impacted due to nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and do not generally require collateral in support of our trade receivables. While we maintain reserves for potential credit losses, we can provide no assurances that such reserves will be sufficient to cover uncollectible receivable amounts or that our losses from such receivables will be consistent with our expectations. See Note 2 for further discussion of our reserves for potential credit losses. 

Furthermore, some of our customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks, which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to us. To the extent one or more of our key customers is in financial distress or commences bankruptcy proceedings, contracts with, or obligations from, these customers may be subject to renegotiation or rejection under applicable provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and similar international laws. 

Our method of accounting for revenue using the percentage-of-completion method could have a negative impact on our results of operations. 

Revenue and gross profit for contracts accounted for using the percentage-of-completion method can be significantly affected by changes in estimated cost to complete such contracts. Significant estimates impacting the cost to complete a contract include: forecast costs of engineering, materials, equipment and subcontracts; forecast costs of labor and labor productivity; schedule durations, including subcontractor and supplier progress; contract disputes, including claims; achievement of contractual performance requirements; and contingency, among others. The cumulative impact of revisions in total cost estimates during the progress of work is reflected in the period in which these changes become known, including, to the extent required, the reversal of profit recognized in prior periods and the recognition of losses expected to be incurred on contracts. Due to the various estimates inherent in our contract accounting, actual results could differ from those estimates, which could result in material changes to our Financial Statements and related disclosures. 

Further, our time and materials (&#8220;T&#38;M&#8221;), cost-reimbursable and unit-rate contracts generally have more variability in the scope of work than fixed-price contracts and provide our customers with greater influence over the timing of when we perform our work. Accordingly, such contracts often result in less predictability with respect to the timing of when our revenue is recognized. See Notes 1 and 2 and &#8220;Critical Accounting Policies&#8221; in Item 7 for further discussion of our contracting and revenue recognition. 

&#160; 

Disruptions at the regional bank in which we deposit our funds could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition. 

We hold substantially all of our cash deposits with a single regional bank and we rely on our deposits with the bank to fund our operations. Any disruption in the bank&#8217;s ability to process payments or maintain our deposits would significantly disrupt our business and could materially affect our operations. In addition, we currently have cash and cash equivalents deposited in excess of federally insured levels with the bank, and if the bank were to fail, we could lose our deposits in excess of insured levels. During 2023, federal governmental agencies took action to protect uninsured deposits at certain U.S. banks; however, if the regional bank in which we hold funds for operations were to fail, we cannot provide any assurances that such governmental agencies will take similar actions. 

Legal, Regulatory and Environmental Risks 

Any changes in U.S. trade policies and retaliatory responses from other countries may significantly increase the costs or limit supplies of materials and products used in our fabrication projects. 

In the past several years, the federal government has imposed new or increased tariffs or duties on an array of imported materials and products used in connection with our fabrication business, which raised our costs for these items (or products made with them), and the current administration in the U.S. has imposed further tariffs, duties and trade restrictions on imports. Foreign governments, including China and Canada, and trading blocs, such as the European Union, have responded in the past by imposing or increasing tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions on U.S. goods. Any trading conflicts and related escalating governmental actions that result in additional tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions could increase our costs, cause disruptions or shortages in our supply chains and/or negatively impact the U.S., regional or local economies. For example, in response to Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. and other countries imposed sanctions and/or other restrictive actions against Russia. These developments caused global economic disruptions, including increases in energy prices and the related European energy crisis. 

We are susceptible to adverse weather conditions in our market areas. 

Although we have large, covered fabrication facilities, a significant amount of our construction activities continue to take place outdoors. Accordingly, our operations may be subject to seasonal variations, including a decline in labor hours worked during the winter months due to a decrease in daylight hours and unfavorable weather conditions, including any seasonal weather conditions that may increasingly arise due to the effects of climate change. In addition, the seasonality of oil and gas industry activity in the Gulf Coast region also affects our operations. Our offshore oil and gas customers often schedule the completion of their projects during the summer months in order to take advantage of more favorable weather during such months. Further, rainy weather, tropical storms, hurricanes and other storms prevalent in the GOA and along the Gulf Coast may also affect our operations. For example, our Houma Facilities have experienced damage from hurricane activity in the past, and during 2024, Hurricane Francine made landfall near our Houma Facilities. 

Beyond financial and regulatory impacts, climate change poses potential physical risks. Scientific studies forecast that these risks include increases in sea levels, stresses on water supply, rising average temperatures and other changes in weather conditions, such as increases in precipitation and extreme weather events, such as floods, heat waves, hurricanes and other tropical storms and cyclones. The projected physical effects of climate change have the potential to directly affect the operations we conduct for customers and result in increased costs related to our operations. However, because the nature and timing of changes in extreme weather events (such as increased frequency, duration and severity) are uncertain, it is not possible for us to estimate reliably the future financial risk to our operations caused by these potential physical risks. The impact of severe weather conditions or natural disasters has included and may continue to include the disruption of our workforce; curtailment of services; weather-related damage to our facilities and equipment for which we are generally uninsured, including impacts from infrastructure challenges in the surrounding areas, resulting in suspension of operations; inability to deliver equipment, personnel and products to project sites in accordance with contract schedules; and loss of productivity. Our suppliers and subcontractors are also subject to severe weather and natural or environmental disasters that have in the past and could in the future affect their ability to deliver products or services or otherwise perform under their contracts. Furthermore, our customers&#8217; operations have been and in the future may be materially and adversely affected by severe weather and seasonal weather conditions, resulting in reduced demand for our services. See Note 2 and &#8220;Other Impacts to Operations&#8221; in Item 7 for further discussion of the impacts of adverse weather conditions to our operations and the risk factor above titled &#8220;We could be exposed to potentially significant liability and costs due to limits on our insurance coverage and losses for which we do not have third-party insurance coverage .&#8221; 

&#160; 

The nature of the industries that we serve subjects us to compliance with regulatory and environmental laws. 

Our operations and properties are subject to a wide variety of existing foreign, federal, state and local laws and other regulations. See &#8220;Government and Environmental Regulation&#8221; in Item 1 for further discussion. Compliance with many of these laws is becoming increasingly complex, stringent and expensive. These laws may impose &#8220;strict liability&#8221; for damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety, rendering a party liable for the environmental damage without regard to its negligence or fault. Certain environmental laws provide for strict, joint and several liability for remediation of spills and other releases of hazardous substances, as well as damage to natural resources. In addition, we could be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances. Such laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for the conduct of others or conditions caused by others, or acts for which we were in compliance with applicable laws at the time such acts were performed. To date, compliance with such laws has not resulted in a material adverse effect on our operations. However, we cannot predict when and whether any new or additional regulations may become effective, such as the regulatory response to climate change, and what their effect will be on us or our customers. 

The demand for our services may be impacted by the regulatory response to climate change. Due to concern over the risk of climate change, several countries have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other gases (greenhouse gas emissions). These regulations include adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, restrictive permitting, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 imposes a federal fee on the emission of greenhouse gases. Existing and future regulatory response to climate change may potentially result in delays or prevent customers&#8217; projects from going forward and could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that some of our customers produce, thereby potentially limiting demand for our services. The demand for our services is also affected by changing taxes, price controls and other laws and regulations related to the oil and gas, chemicals, commodities and alternative energy industries. We may not be able to pass any resulting cost increases on to our customers. 

Offshore construction and drilling in certain areas is opposed by many environmental groups and, in certain areas, has been restricted. To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental actions are taken that prohibit or restrict offshore construction and drilling or impose environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry in general and the offshore construction industry, our business and prospects could be adversely affected. We cannot determine to what extent future operations and results of operations may be affected by new legislation, new regulations or changes in existing regulations. 

Actions of activist shareholders could create uncertainty about our future strategic direction, be costly and divert the attention of our management and board. In addition, some institutional investors may be discouraged from investing in the industries that we service. 

Activist shareholders continue to place increasing pressure on publicly-traded companies to effect changes to corporate governance practices, executive compensation practices or social and environmental practices, or to undertake certain corporate actions or reorganizations. Responding to challenges from activist shareholders, such as proxy contests, media campaigns or other public or private means, could be costly and time consuming and could have an adverse effect on our reputation and divert the attention and resources of management and our Board, which could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. Additionally, shareholder activism could create uncertainty about our leadership or our future strategic direction, resulting in loss of future business opportunities, which could adversely affect our business, future operations, profitability and our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. As of December 31, 2024, based on our review of public filings with the SEC, we believe over one-quarter of our stock is held by a combination of institutional investors, pooled investment funds and certain other investors with a history of shareholder activism. One such investor has a Schedule 13D on file with the SEC that reserves that investor&#8217;s rights to pursue corporate governance changes, board structure changes, changes to capitalization, potential business combinations or dispositions involving the Company or certain of our businesses, or suggestions for improving the Company&#8217;s financial and/or operational performance. 

Our business is highly dependent on our ability to utilize the navigation canals adjacent to our facilities. 

Our Houma Facilities are located on the Houma Navigation Canal approximately 30 miles from the GOA. The Houma Navigation Canal provides the shortest and least restrictive means of access from our facilities to open waters. These waterways are navigable waterways of the U.S. and, as such, are protected by federal law from unauthorized obstructions that would hinder water-borne traffic. Federal law also authorizes maintenance of these waterways by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. These waterways are dredged from time to time to maintain water depth and, while federal funding for dredging has historically been provided, there is no assurance that Congressional appropriations sufficient for adequate dredging and other maintenance of these waterways will be continued. If funding were not appropriated for that purpose, some or all of these waterways could become impassable by barges or other vessels required to transport many of our products.

Investing in our securities involves a number of significant risks. You should consider carefully the following information before making an investment in our securities. The risks below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not 

presently known to us or not presently deemed material by us may also impair our operations and performance. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 

The following is a summary of the principal risks that you should carefully consider before investing in our securities. 

We are subject to risks related to the economy. 

&#8226; Global economic, political and market conditions, including uncertainty about the financial stability of the United States, could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#8226; The current period of capital markets disruption and economic uncertainty could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

&#8226; Inflation may adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of our portfolio companies. 

&#8226; We are dependent on information systems and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business, which may, in turn, negatively affect our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations 

We are subject to risks related to our business and operations. 

&#8226; The lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business. 

&#8226; We borrow money, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss and may increase the risk of investing in us. 

&#8226; Defaults under our current borrowings or any future borrowing facility or notes may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

&#8226; If we are unable to obtain additional debt financing, or if our borrowing capacity is materially reduced, our business could be materially adversely affected. 

&#8226; Our ability to achieve our investment objective depends on our Adviser&#8217;s ability to manage and support our investment process. If our Adviser were to lose a significant number of its key professionals, or terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement, our ability to achieve our investment objective could be significantly harmed. 

&#8226; Because our business model depends to a significant extent upon Blue Owl&#8217;s relationships with corporations, financial institutions and investment firms, the inability of Blue Owl to maintain or develop these relationships, or the failure of these relationships to generate investment opportunities, could adversely affect our business. 

&#8226; We may face increasing competition for investment opportunities, which could delay further deployment of our capital, reduce returns and result in losses. 

&#8226; Our investment portfolio is recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by our Adviser in accordance with procedures approved by our Board and, as a result, there is and will be uncertainty as to the value of our portfolio investments. 

&#8226; Our Board may change our operating policies and strategies without prior notice or shareholder approval, the effects of which may be adverse to our shareholders. 

&#8226; Internal and external cybersecurity threats and risks, as well as other disasters, may adversely affect our business or the business of our portfolio companies by impairing the ability to conduct business effectively. 

We are subject to risks related to our Adviser and its affiliates. 

&#8226; Our Adviser and its affiliates, including our officers and some of our directors, may face conflicts of interest caused by compensation arrangements with us and our affiliates, which could result in increased risk-taking or speculative investments, or cause our Adviser to use substantial leverage. 

&#8226; The time and resources that individuals associated with our Adviser devote to us may be diverted, and we may face additional competition due to, among other things, the fact that neither our Adviser nor its affiliates is prohibited from raising money for or managing another entity that makes the same types of investments that we target. 

&#8226; Our Adviser and its affiliates may face conflicts of interest with respect to services performed for issuers in which we may invest. 

&#8226; Our Adviser or its affiliates may have incentives to favor their respective other accounts and clients and/or Blue Owl over us, which may result in conflicts of interest that could be harmful to us. 

&#8226; We may be obligated to pay our Adviser incentive fees even if we incur a net loss due to a decline in the value of our portfolio and even if our earned interest income is not payable in cash. 

&#8226; Our ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates is restricted. 

&#8226; Our Adviser&#8217;s inability to attract, retain and develop human capital in a highly competitive talent market could have an adverse effect on our Adviser, and thus us. 

We are subject to risks related to business development companies. 

&#8226; The requirement that we invest a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets could preclude us from investing in accordance with our current business strategy; conversely, the failure to invest a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets could result in our failure to maintain our status as a BDC. 

&#8226; Regulations governing our operation as a BDC and RIC affect our ability to raise capital and the way in which we raise additional capital or borrow for investment purposes, which may have a negative effect on our growth. As a BDC, the necessity of raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including risks associated with leverage. 

We are subject to risks related to our investments. 

&#8226; Our investments in portfolio companies may be risky, and we could lose all or part of our investments. 

&#8226; We have invested and may continue to invest through joint ventures, partnerships and other special purpose vehicles and our investments through these vehicles may entail greater risks, or risks that we otherwise would not incur, if we otherwise made such investments directly. 

&#8226; Defaults by our portfolio companies could jeopardize a portfolio company&#8217;s ability to meet its obligations under the debt or equity investments that we hold which could harm our operating results. 

&#8226; Subordinated liens on collateral securing debt investments that we may make to portfolio companies may be subject to control by senior creditors with first priority liens. If there is a default, the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to repay in full both the first priority creditors and us. 

&#8226; We generally will not control the business operations of our portfolio companies and, due to the illiquid nature of our holdings in our portfolio companies, we may not be able to dispose of our interests in our portfolio companies. 

&#8226; We and our portfolio companies are, and will continue to be, exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates. 

&#8226; International investments create additional risks. 

&#8226; Our portfolio may be focused on a limited number of portfolio companies or industries, which will subject us to a risk of significant loss if any of these companies defaults on its obligations under any of its debt instruments or if there is a downturn in a particular industry. 

We are subject to risks related to an investment in our common stock. 

&#8226; The value of our common stock may fluctuate significantly. 

&#8226; The amount of any distributions we may make on our common stock is uncertain. We may not be able to pay distributions to shareholders, or be able to sustain distributions at any particular level, and our distributions per share, if any, may not grow over time, and our distributions per share may be reduced. We have not established any limits on the extent to which we may use borrowings, if any, and we may use sources other than cash flows from operations to fund distributions (which may reduce the amount of capital we ultimately invest in portfolio companies). 

&#8226; Our shares are not listed on an exchange or quoted through a quotation system and will not be listed for the foreseeable future, if ever. Therefore, our shareholders will have limited liquidity. 

We are subject to risks related to an investment in our unsecured notes . 

&#8226; Our unsecured notes are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness we have currently incurred or may incur in the future. 

&#8226; Our unsecured notes are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. 

&#8226; A downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of the credit rating assigned by a rating agency to us or our unsecured notes, if any, or change in the debt markets, could cause the liquidity or market value of our unsecured notes to decline significantly. 

We are subject to risks related to U.S. federal income tax. 

&#8226; We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax if we are unable to maintain our tax treatment as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code or if we make investments through taxable subsidiaries. 

&#8226; We may have difficulty paying our required distributions if we recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income. 

We are subject to general risks. 

&#8226; Changes in laws or regulations governing our operations may adversely affect our business or cause us to alter our business strategy. 

&#8226; Heightened scrutiny of the financial services industry by regulators may materially and adversely affect our business. 

Risks Related to the Economy 

Global economic, political and market conditions, including uncertainty about the financial stability of the United States, could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

The current worldwide financial markets situation, as well as various social, political, economic and other conditions and events (including political tensions in the United States and around the world, wars and other forms of conflict (including, for example, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East and Northern Africa region), terrorist acts, security operations and catastrophic events, natural disasters such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, global health epidemics, pandemics and emergencies, fluctuations in interest rates, strikes, work stoppages, labor shortages, labor disputes, supply chain disruptions and accidents), may disrupt our operations, contribute to increased market volatility, have long term effects on the United States and worldwide financial markets, and cause economic uncertainties or deterioration in the United States and worldwide. As global systems, economies and financial markets are increasingly interconnected, events that once had only local impact are now more likely to have regional or even global effects. Events that occur in one country, region or financial market will, more frequently, adversely impact issuers in other countries, regions or markets, including in established markets such as the United States. These impacts can be exacerbated by failures of governments and societies to adequately respond to an emerging event or threat. 

Uncertainty can result in or coincide with, among other things: increased volatility in the financial markets for securities, derivatives, loans, credit and currency; a decrease in the reliability of market prices and difficulty in valuing assets (including portfolio company assets); greater fluctuations in spreads on debt investments and currency exchange rates; increased risk of default (by both government and private obligors and issuers); further social, economic, and political instability; nationalization of private enterprise; greater governmental involvement in the economy or in social factors that impact the economy; changes to governmental regulation and supervision of the loan, securities, derivatives and currency markets and market participants and decreased or revised monitoring of such markets by governments or self-regulatory organizations and reduced enforcement of regulations; limitations on the activities of investors in such markets; controls or restrictions on foreign investment, capital controls and limitations on repatriation of invested capital; the significant loss of liquidity and the inability to purchase, sell and otherwise fund investments or settle transactions (including, but not limited to, a market freeze); unavailability of currency hedging techniques; substantial, and in some periods extremely high rates of inflation, which can last many years and have negative effects on credit and securities markets as well as the economy as a whole; recessions; and difficulties in obtaining and/or enforcing legal judgments. 

Any of the above factors, including sanctions, export controls, tariffs, trade wars and other governmental actions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common shares and/or debt securities to decline. The United States has recently enacted and proposed to enact significant new tariffs. Additionally, the new U.S. Presidential administration has directed various federal agencies to further evaluate key aspects of U.S. trade policy and there has been ongoing discussion and commentary regarding potential significant changes to U.S. trade policies, treaties and tariffs. Global health emergencies, natural disasters, strikes, work stoppages or accidents could further weaken the domestic/global economies and create additional uncertainties, which may negatively impact the businesses in which we invest directly or indirectly and, in turn, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. We monitor developments and seek to manage our investments in a manner consistent with achieving our investment objective, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so. Additionally, social unrest and other political and security concerns may not abate, may worsen and could spread. Losses from terrorist attacks, global health emergencies, natural disasters, strikes, work stoppages or accidents are generally uninsurable. 

The current period of capital markets disruption and economic uncertainty could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

In recent years, the U.S. corporate debt markets have experienced disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and an inflationary economic environment. These market conditions may make it difficult to extend the maturity of or refinance our existing indebtedness or obtain new indebtedness with similar terms and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business. The debt capital that will be available to us in the future, if at all, may be at a higher cost and on less favorable terms and conditions than what we currently experience, including being in an elevated rate environment. If we are unable to raise or refinance debt, then our equity investors may not benefit from the potential for increased returns on equity resulting from leverage and we may be limited in our ability to make new commitments or to fund existing commitments to our portfolio companies. An inability to extend the maturity of, or refinance, our existing indebtedness or obtain new indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Significant disruption or volatility in the capital markets may also have a negative effect on the valuations of our investments. While most of our investments are not publicly traded, applicable accounting standards require us to assume as part of our valuation process that our investments are sold in a principal market to market participants (even if we plan on holding an investment through its maturity). Significant disruption or volatility in the capital markets may also affect the pace of our investment activity and the potential for liquidity events involving our investments. Thus, the illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments to access capital if required, and as a result, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded our investments if we were required to sell them for liquidity purposes. An inability to raise or access capital could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and cause our net asset value to decline. 

Economic recessions or downturns could impair our portfolio companies and harm our operating results. 

Many of our portfolio companies may be susceptible to economic slowdowns or recessions and may be unable to repay our debt investments during these periods. In the past, instability in the global capital markets resulted in disruptions in liquidity in the 

debt capital markets, significant write-offs in the financial services sector, the re-pricing of credit risk in the broadly syndicated credit market and the failure of major domestic and international financial institutions. In particular, in past periods of instability, the financial services sector was negatively impacted by significant write-offs as the value of the assets held by financial firms declined, impairing their capital positions and abilities to lend and invest. In addition, continued uncertainty in connection with economic sanctions resulting from the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, uncertainty around the conflict in the Middle East, and uncertainty between the United States and other countries, including China, with respect to trade policies, treaties, and tariffs, among other factors, have caused disruption in the global markets. There can be no assurance that market conditions will not worsen in the future. 

In an economic downturn, we may have non-performing assets or non-performing assets may increase, and the value of our portfolio is likely to decrease during these periods. Adverse economic conditions may also decrease the value of any collateral securing our loans and the value of our equity investments. A severe recession may further decrease the value of such collateral and result in losses of value in our portfolio and a decrease in our revenues, net income, assets and net worth. Unfavorable economic conditions may require us to modify the payment terms of our investments, including changes in &#8220;payment in kind&#8221; or &#8220;PIK&#8221; interest provisions and/or cash interest rates, and also could increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us on terms we deem acceptable. These events could prevent us from increasing investments and harm our operating results. 

The occurrence of recessionary conditions and/or negative developments in the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Any such unfavorable economic conditions, including elevated interest rates, may also increase our funding costs, limit our access to capital markets or negatively impact our ability to obtain financing, particularly from the debt markets. In addition, any future financial market uncertainty could lead to financial market disruptions and could further impact our ability to obtain financing. 

These events could limit our investment originations, limit our ability to grow and negatively impact our operating results and financial condition. 

Inflation may adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of our portfolio companies. 

Certain of our portfolio companies operate in industries that have been, or may be, impacted by inflation. Recent inflationary pressures have increased the costs of labor, energy and raw materials and have adversely affected consumer spending, economic growth and our portfolio companies&#8217; operations. If such portfolio companies are unable to pass any increases in the costs of their operations along to their customers, it could adversely affect their operating results. Such conditions would increase the risk of default on their obligations as a borrower. In addition, any projected future decreases in our portfolio companies&#8217; operating results due to inflation could adversely impact the fair value of those investments. Any decreases in the fair value of our investments could result in future unrealized losses and therefore reduce our net assets resulting from operations. Any decreases in the fair value of our investments could result in future realized or unrealized losses. 

Fluctuations in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business and that of our portfolio companies. 

Fluctuations in interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity, the financial condition of our portfolio companies and the financial condition of the end customers who ultimately create demand for the capital we supply, all of which could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations . The Federal Reserve decreased the federal funds rate twice in 2024. Although the Federal Reserve has signaled the potential for additional federal funds rate cuts, there remains uncertainty around the rate and timing of decreases, including as a result of the transition to the new U.S. Presidential administration. Uncertainty surrounding future Federal Reserve actions may have a material effect on our business making it particularly difficult for us to obtain financing at attractive rates, impacting our ability to execute on our growth strategies or future acquisitions. 

Our cash and cash equivalents could be adversely affected if the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and cash equivalents fail. 

We regularly maintain cash balances at third-party financial institutions in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. If a depository institution fails to return these deposits or is otherwise subject to adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets, our access to invested cash or cash equivalents could be limited which adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition. 

Risks Related to Our Business 

The lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business. 

We may acquire a significant percentage of our investments from privately held companies in directly negotiated transactions. Substantially all of these investments are subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or are otherwise less liquid than exchange-listed securities or other securities for which there is an active trading market. We typically would be unable to exit these investments unless and until the portfolio company has a liquidity event such as a sale, refinancing, or initial public offering. 

The illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult or impossible for us to sell such investments if the need arises. In addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have previously recorded our investments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Moreover, investments purchased by us that are liquid at the time of purchase may subsequently become illiquid due to events relating to the issuer, market events, economic conditions or investor perceptions. 

We borrow money, which magnifies the potential for gain or loss and may increase the risk of investing in us. 

The use of borrowings, also known as leverage, increases the volatility of investments by magnifying the potential for gain or loss on invested equity capital. We currently borrow under our credit facilities and have issued or assumed other senior securities, and in the future may borrow from, or issue additional senior securities to, banks, insurance companies, funds, institutional investors and other lenders and investors. Holders of these senior securities have fixed-dollar claims on our assets that are superior to the claims of our shareholders. If the value of our assets decreases, leverage would cause our net asset value to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have if we did not employ leverage. Similarly, any decrease in our income would cause net income to decline more sharply than it would have had we not borrowed. Such a decline could negatively affect our ability to service our debt or make distributions to our shareholders. In addition, our shareholders will bear the burden of any increase in our expenses as a result of our use of leverage, including interest expenses and any increase in the base management or incentive fees payable to our Adviser attributable to the increase in assets purchased using leverage. There can be no assurance that a leveraging strategy will be successful. 

Our ability to service any borrowings that we incur will depend largely on our financial performance and will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and competitive pressures. Moreover, the management fee will be payable based on our average gross assets excluding cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts, which may give our Adviser an incentive to use leverage to make additional investments. See &#8220;&#8212; Our Adviser and its affiliates, including our officers and some of our directors, may face conflicts of interest caused by compensation arrangements with us and our affiliates, which could result in increased risk-taking or speculative investments, or cause our Adviser to use substantial leverage .&#8221; The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on our Adviser&#8217;s and our Board&#8217;s assessment of market and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain credit at all or on terms acceptable to us, which could affect our return on capital. However, to the extent that we use leverage to finance our assets, our financing costs will reduce cash available for distributions to shareholders. Moreover, we may not be able to meet our financing obligations and, to the extent that we cannot, we risk the loss of some or all of our assets to liquidation or sale to satisfy the obligations. In such an event, we may be forced to sell assets at significantly depressed prices due to market conditions or otherwise, which may result in losses. 

In addition to having fixed-dollar claims on our assets that are superior to the claims of our common shareholders, obligations to lenders may be secured by a first priority security interest in our portfolio of investments and cash. As a BDC, generally, the ratio of our total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness represented by senior securities) to our total indebtedness represented by senior securities plus any preferred stock, if any, must be at least 200%; however, the Small Business Credit Availability Act has modified the 1940 Act by allowing a BDC to increase the maximum amount of leverage it may incur from an asset coverage ratio of 200% to an asset coverage ratio of 150%, if certain requirements are met. If this ratio declines below the relevant amount, we cannot incur additional debt and could be required to sell a portion of our investments to repay some indebtedness when it may be disadvantageous to do so. This could have a material adverse effect on our operations, and we may not be able to service our debt or make distributions. 

The following table illustrates the effect of leverage on returns from an investment in our common stock assuming various annual returns on our portfolio, net of expenses. Leverage generally magnifies the return of shareholders when the portfolio return is positive and magnifies their losses when the portfolio return is negative. The calculations in the table below are hypothetical, and actual returns may be higher or lower than those appearing in the table below.

See &#8220; ITEM 7 &#8212; MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS &#8212; Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources &#8221; for more information regarding our borrowings. 

Defaults under our current borrowings or any future borrowing facility or notes may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

Our borrowings may include customary covenants, including certain limitations on our incurrence of additional indebtedness and on our ability to make distributions to our shareholders, or redeem, repurchase or retire shares of stock, upon the occurrence of certain events and certain financial covenants related to asset coverage and liquidity and other maintenance covenants, as well as customary events of default. In the event we default under the terms of our current or future borrowings, our business could be adversely affected as we may be forced to sell a portion of our investments quickly and prematurely at what may be disadvantageous prices to us in order to meet our outstanding payment obligations and/or support working capital requirements under the terms of our current or future borrowings, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. An event of default under the terms of our current or any future borrowings could result in an accelerated 

maturity date for all amounts outstanding thereunder, and in some instances, lead to a cross-default under other borrowings. This could reduce our liquidity and cash flow and impair our ability to grow our business. Collectively, substantially all of our assets are currently pledged as collateral under our credit facilities. If we were to default on our obligations under the terms of our credit facilities or any future secured debt instrument the agent for the applicable creditors would be able to assume control of the disposition of any or all of our assets securing such debt, including the selection of such assets to be disposed and the timing of such disposition, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

Provisions in our current borrowings or any other future borrowings may limit discretion in operating our business. 

Any security interests and/or negative covenants required by a credit facility we enter into or notes we issue may limit our ability to create liens on assets to secure additional debt and may make it difficult for us to restructure or refinance indebtedness at or prior to maturity or obtain additional debt or equity financing. 

A credit facility may be backed by all or a portion of our loans and securities on which the lenders will have a security interest. We may pledge up to 100% of our assets and may grant a security interest in all of our assets under the terms of any debt instrument we enter into with lenders. We expect that any security interests we grant will be set forth in a pledge and security agreement and evidenced by the filing of financing statements by the agent for the lenders. In addition, we expect that the custodian for our securities serving as collateral for such loan would include in its electronic systems notices indicating the existence of such security interests and, following notice of occurrence of an event of default, if any, and during its continuance, will only accept transfer instructions with respect to any such securities from the lender or its designee. If we were to default under the terms of any debt instrument, the agent for the applicable lenders would be able to assume control of the timing of disposition of any or all of our assets securing such debt, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

In addition, any security interests and/or negative covenants required by a credit facility may limit our ability to create liens on assets to secure additional debt and may make it difficult for us to restructure or refinance indebtedness at or prior to maturity or obtain additional debt or equity financing. In addition, if our borrowing base under a credit facility were to decrease, we may be required to secure additional assets in an amount sufficient to cure any borrowing base deficiency. In the event that all of our assets are secured at the time of such a borrowing base deficiency, we could be required to repay advances under a credit facility or make deposits to a collection account, either of which could have a material adverse impact on our ability to fund future investments and to make distributions. 

In addition, we may be subject to limitations as to how borrowed funds may be used, which may include restrictions on geographic and industry concentrations, loan size, payment frequency and status, average life, collateral interests and investment ratings, as well as regulatory restrictions on leverage which may affect the amount of funding that may be obtained. There may also be certain requirements relating to portfolio performance, including required minimum portfolio yield and limitations on delinquencies and charge-offs, a violation of which could limit further advances and, in some cases, result in an event of default. An event of default under a credit facility could result in an accelerated maturity date for all amounts outstanding thereunder, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and could lead to cross default under other credit facilities. This could reduce our liquidity and cash flow and impair our ability to manage our business. 

Under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, we have agreed not to incur any additional secured indebtedness other than in certain limited circumstances in which the incurrence is permitted under the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, if our borrowing base under the Revolving Credit Facility were to decrease, we would be required to secure additional assets or repay advances under the Revolving Credit Facility which could have a material adverse impact on our ability to fund future investments and to make distributions. 

In addition, under the terms of our credit facilities, we are subject to limitations as to how borrowed funds may be used, as well as regulatory restrictions on leverage which may affect the amount of funding that we may obtain. There may also be certain requirements relating to portfolio performance, a violation of which could limit further advances and, in some cases, result in an event of default. This could reduce our liquidity and cash flow and impair our ability to grow our business. 

If we are unable to obtain additional debt financing, or if our borrowing capacity is materially reduced, our business could be materially adversely affected. 

We may want to obtain additional debt financing, or need to do so upon maturity of our credit facilities, in order to obtain funds which may be made available for investments. Our credit facilities, notes and CLOs currently expire between March 2025 and October 2037. If we are unable to increase, renew or replace any such facilities and enter into new debt financing facilities or other debt financing on commercially reasonable terms, our liquidity may be reduced significantly. In addition, if we are unable to repay amounts outstanding under any such facilities and are declared in default or are unable to renew or refinance these facilities, we may not be able to make new investments or operate our business in the normal course. These situations may arise due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as lack of access to the credit markets, a severe decline in the value of the U.S. dollar, an economic downturn or an operational problem that affects us or third parties, and could materially damage our business operations, results of operations and financial condition. See &#8220;&#8212; The current period of capital markets disruption and economic uncertainty could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations .&#8221; 

Our ability to achieve our investment objective depends on our Adviser&#8217;s ability to manage and support our investment process. If our Adviser were to lose a significant number of its key professionals, or terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement, our ability to achieve our investment objective could be significantly harmed. 

We do not have any employees. Additionally, we have no internal management capacity other than our appointed executive officers and will be dependent upon the investment expertise, skill and network of business contacts of our Adviser to achieve our investment objective. Our Adviser evaluates, negotiates, executes, monitors, and services our investments. Our success depends to a significant extent on the continued service and coordination of our Adviser, including its key professionals. The departure of a significant number of key professionals from our Adviser could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our investment objective. 

Our ability to achieve our investment objective also depends on the ability of our Adviser to identify, analyze, invest in, finance, and monitor companies that meet our investment criteria. Our Adviser&#8217;s capabilities in structuring the investment process, and providing competent, attentive and efficient services to us depend on the involvement of investment professionals of adequate number and sophistication to match the corresponding flow of transactions. To achieve our investment objective, our Adviser may need to retain, hire, train, supervise, and manage new investment professionals to participate in our investment selection and monitoring process. Our Adviser may not be able to find qualified investment professionals in a timely manner or at all. Any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

In addition, the Investment Advisory Agreement has a termination provision that allows the agreement to be terminated by us on 60 days' notice without penalty by the vote of a Majority of the Outstanding Shares of our common stock or by the vote of our independent directors and generally may be terminated at any time, without penalty, by our Adviser upon 120 days' notice to us. Furthermore, the Investment Advisory Agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment, as defined in the 1940 Act, by the Adviser. If the Adviser resigns or is terminated, or if we do not obtain the requisite approvals of shareholders and our Board to approve an agreement with the Adviser after an assignment, we may not be able to find a new investment adviser or hire internal management with similar expertise and ability to provide the same or equivalent services on acceptable terms prior to the termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, or at all. If we are unable to do so quickly, our operations are likely to experience a disruption and costs under any new agreements that we enter into could increase. Our financial condition, business and results of operations, as well as our ability to meet our payment obligations under our indebtedness and pay distributions, are likely to be adversely affected, and the value of our common stock may decline. 

Because our business model depends to a significant extent upon Blue Owl&#8217;s relationships with corporations, financial institutions and investment firms, the inability of Blue Owl to maintain or develop these relationships, or the failure of these relationships to generate investment opportunities, could adversely affect our business. 

Blue Owl depends on its relationships with corporations, financial institutions and investment firms, and we rely to a significant extent upon these relationships to provide us with potential investment opportunities. The investment management business is intensely competitive, with competition based on a variety of factors, including investment performance, business relationships, quality of service provided to clients, fund investor liquidity, fund terms (including fees and economic sharing arrangements), brand recognition and business reputation. If Blue Owl fails to maintain its reputation it may not be able to maintain its existing relationships or develop new relationships or sources of investment opportunities, and we may not be able to grow our investment portfolio. In addition, individuals with whom Blue Owl has relationships are not obligated to provide us with investment opportunities, and, therefore, there is no assurance that such relationships will generate investment opportunities for us. 

Negative publicity regarding Blue Owl or its personnel could give rise to reputational risk that could significantly harm our existing business and business prospects. Similarly, events could occur that damage the reputation of our industry generally, such as the insolvency or bankruptcy of large funds or a significant number of funds or highly publicized incidents of fraud or other scandals, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, regardless of whether any of those events directly relate to us or our investments. 

We may face increasing competition for investment opportunities, which could delay further deployment of our capital, reduce returns and result in losses. 

We may compete for investments with other BDCs and investment funds (including registered investment companies, private equity funds and mezzanine funds), including the other Blue Owl Credit Clients or other funds managed by our Adviser or its affiliates comprising Blue Owl&#8217;s Credit platform, the private funds managed by Blue Owl&#8217;s GP Strategic Capital platform and the funds and accounts managed by Blue Owl&#8217;s Real Assets platform, as well as traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks and other sources of funding. Moreover, alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds, continue to increase their investment focus in our target market of privately owned U.S. companies. We may experience increased competition from banks and investment vehicles who may continue to lend to the middle market. Additionally, the U.S. Federal Reserve and other bank regulators may periodically provide incentives to U.S. commercial banks to originate more loans to U.S. middle-market private companies. As a result of these market participants and regulatory incentives, competition for investment opportunities in privately owned U.S. companies is strong and may intensify. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments than us. These characteristics could allow our competitors to consider a wider variety of investments, establish more relationships and offer better pricing and more flexible structuring than we are able to do. 

Numerous factors increase our competitive risks, including, but not limited to: 

&#8226; A number of our competitors may have or are perceived to have more expertise or financial, technical, marketing and other resources and more personnel than we do; 

&#8226; We may not perform as well as competitors&#8217; funds or other available investment products; 

&#8226; Several of our competitors have raised significant amounts of capital, and many of them have similar investment objectives to ours, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities; 

&#8226; Some of our competitors may have lower fees or alternative fee arrangements; 

&#8226; Some of our competitors may have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us, which may create competitive disadvantages for us; 

&#8226; Some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances, different risk assessments or lower return thresholds than us, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and to bid more aggressively than us or to agree to less restrictive legal terms and protections for investments that we want to make; and 

&#8226; Some of our competitors may be subject to less regulation or fewer conflicts of interest and, accordingly, may have more flexibility to undertake and execute certain businesses or investments than we do, bear less compliance expense than we do or be viewed differently in the marketplace. 

We may lose investment opportunities if we do not match our competitors&#8217; pricing, terms, and investment structure criteria. If we are forced to match these competitors&#8217; investment terms criteria, we may not be able to achieve acceptable returns on our investments or may bear substantial risk of capital loss. A significant increase in the number and/or the size of our competitors in our target market could force us to accept less attractive investment terms. Furthermore, many competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC or the source of income, asset diversification and distribution requirements we must satisfy to maintain our RIC tax treatment. The competitive pressures we face, and the manner in which we react or adjust to competitive pressures, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, effective yield on investments, investment returns, leverage ratio, and cash flows. As a result of this competition, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities from time to time. Also, we may not be able to identify and make investments that are consistent with our investment objective. 

Our investment portfolio is recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by our Adviser in accordance with procedures approved by our Board and, as a result, there is and will be uncertainty as to the value of our portfolio investments. 

Under the 1940 Act, we are required to carry our portfolio investments at market value or, if there is no readily available market value, at fair value as determined in accordance with procedures established by our Adviser and approved by our Board. There is not a public market or active secondary market for many of the types of investments in privately held companies that we hold and intend to make. Our investments may not be publicly traded or actively traded on a secondary market but, instead, may be traded on a privately negotiated over-the-counter secondary market for institutional investors, if at all. As a result, we will value these investments quarterly at fair value as determined in good faith in accordance with valuation policy and procedures approved by our Board. 

The determination of fair value, and thus the amount of unrealized appreciation or depreciation we may recognize in any reporting period, is to a degree subjective, and our Adviser has a conflict of interest in determining fair value. We will value our investments quarterly at fair value as determined in good faith by our Adviser, based on, among other things, input of our Audit Committee and independent third-party valuation firm(s) engaged at the direction of our Adviser. The types of factors that may be considered in determining the fair values of our investments include the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company&#8217;s ability to make payments and its earnings, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparison to publicly traded companies, discounted cash flow, current market interest rates and other relevant factors. Because such valuations, and particularly valuations of private securities and private companies, are inherently uncertain, the valuations may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time due to changes in current market conditions. The determinations of fair value in accordance with procedures approved by our Board may differ materially from the values that would have been used if an active market and market quotations existed for such investments. Our net asset value could be adversely affected if the determinations regarding the fair value of the investments were materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon the disposal of such investments. 

Our Board may change our operating policies and strategies without prior notice or shareholder approval, the effects of which may be adverse to our shareholders. 

Our Board has the authority to modify or waive current operating policies, investment criteria and strategies without prior notice and without shareholder approval. We cannot predict the effect any changes to current operating policies, investment criteria and strategies would have on our business, net asset value, operating results and the value of our securities. However, the effects might be adverse, which could negatively impact our ability to pay you distributions and cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Moreover, we will have significant flexibility in investing the net proceeds of our offering and may use the net proceeds from our offering in ways with which our investors may not agree. 

Any unrealized depreciation we experience on our portfolio may be an indication of future realized losses, which could reduce our income available for distribution. 

As a BDC, we are required to carry our investments at market value or, if no market value is ascertainable, at the fair value as determined in good faith in accordance with procedures approved by our Board. Decreases in the market values or fair values of our investments relative to amortized cost will be recorded as unrealized depreciation. Any unrealized losses in our portfolio could be an indication of a portfolio company&#8217;s inability to meet its repayment obligations to us with respect to the affected loans. This could result in realized losses in the future and ultimately in reductions of our income available for distribution in future periods. In addition, decreases in the market value or fair value of our investments will reduce our net asset value. See &#8220; ITEM 7 &#8212; MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS &#8212; Critical Accounting Policies &#8212; Investments at Fair Value .&#8221; 

We are subject to risks associated with the market&#8217;s limited experience with SOFR, which will affect our cost of capital and results of operations. 

We historically used the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (&#8220;LIBOR&#8221;) as a reference rate in the loans we extended to our portfolio companies. The terms of our debt investments generally included minimum interest rate floors which were calculated based on LIBOR. In July 2017, the United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority, as supervisor of ICE Benchmark Administrator (&#8220;IBA&#8221;), the administrator of LIBOR, announced that it would phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021 (later extended to the end of June 2023 for USD LIBOR only). IBA ceased publishing GBP, EUR, CHF and JPY LIBOR rates on January 1, 2022 and ceased publishing overnight and 12-month USD LIBOR on June, 30 2023. 

In January 2023, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule implementing the U.S. Adjustable Interest Rate Act of 2022 (the &#8220;LIBOR Act&#8221;) that, among other things, identifies the applicable SOFR-based benchmark replacements under the LIBOR Act. 

Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we transitioned any LIBOR-based investments to SOFR and currently none of our investments are indexed to LIBOR. 

SOFR is considered to be a risk-free rate, and USD LIBOR was a risk weighted rate. Thus, SOFR tends to be a lower rate than USD LIBOR, because SOFR does not contain a risk component. This difference may negatively impact our net interest margin of our investments. Also, the use of SOFR based rates is relatively new, and market experience with SOFR based rate loans is limited. There could be unanticipated difficulties or disruptions with the calculation and publication of SOFR based rates. This could result in increased borrowing costs for us or could adversely impact the interest income we receive from our portfolio companies or the market value of our investments. 

Internal and external cybersecurity threats and risks, as well as other disasters, may adversely affect our business or the business of our portfolio companies by impairing the ability to conduct business effectively. 

Cybersecurity incidents and cyber-attacks have been occurring globally at a more frequent and severe level, and will likely continue to increase in frequency in the future. Cyber-attacks and other security threats could originate from a wide variety of sources, including cyber criminals, nation state hackers, hacktivists and other outside parties. Additionally, cyber-attacks and other security threats have become increasingly complex as a result of the emergence of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, which are able to identify and target new vulnerabilities in information technology systems. 

The occurrence of a disaster, such as a cyber-attack against us, any of our portfolio companies, or against a third-party that has access to our data or networks, a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, failure of our disaster recovery systems, or consequential employee error, could have an adverse effect on our ability to communicate or conduct business, negatively impacting our operations and financial condition. This adverse effect can become particularly acute if those events affect our electronic data processing, transmission, storage, and retrieval systems, or impact the availability, integrity, or confidentiality of our data. In addition, the rapid evolution and increasing prevalence of artificial intelligence technologies may also intensify our cybersecurity risks. Although we are not currently aware of any cyber-attacks or other incidents that, individually or in the aggregate, have materially affected, or would reasonably be expected to materially affect our operations or financial condition, there has been an increase in the frequency and sophistication of the cyber and security threats that we face, with attacks ranging from those common to businesses generally to more advanced and persistent attacks. 

We, and our portfolio companies, depend heavily upon computer systems to perform necessary business functions. Despite the implementation of a variety of security measures, our computer systems, networks, and data, like those of other companies, could be subject to cyber-attacks and unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, such as from physical and electronic break-ins or unauthorized tampering. If one or more of these events occurs, it could potentially jeopardize the confidential, proprietary, and other information processed, stored in, and transmitted through our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations, which could result in financial losses, litigation, regulatory penalties, client dissatisfaction or loss, reputational damage, and increased costs associated with mitigation of damages and remediation. 

Third parties with which we do business may also be sources of cybersecurity or other technological risk. We outsource certain functions and these relationships allow for the storage and processing of our information, as well as client, counterparty, employee, and borrower information. While we engage in actions to reduce our exposure resulting from outsourcing, ongoing threats may result in unauthorized access, loss, exposure, destruction, or other cybersecurity incidents that adversely affects our data, resulting in increased costs and other consequences as described above. 

In addition, cybersecurity risks are exacerbated by the rapidly increasing volume of highly sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and intellectual property, and personally identifiable information and other sensitive information that we collect and store in our data centers, on our cloud environments and on our networks. We may also invest in strategic assets having a national or regional profile or in infrastructure assets, the nature of which could expose them to a greater risk of being subject to a terrorist attack or security breach than other assets or businesses. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information are critical to our operations. A significant actual or potential theft, loss, corruption, exposure, fraudulent use or misuse of fund investor, employee or other personally identifiable or, proprietary business data or other sensitive information, whether by third parties or as a result of employee malfeasance (or the negligence or malfeasance of third party service providers that have access to such confidential information) or otherwise, non-compliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or intellectual property or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could result in significant remediation and other costs, fines, litigation or regulatory actions against us and significant reputational harm., any of which could harm our business and results of operations. 

Moreover, the increased use of mobile and cloud technologies due to the proliferation of remote work resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic could heighten these and other operational risks as certain aspects of the security of such technologies may be complex and unpredictable. Reliance on mobile or cloud technology or any failure by mobile technology and cloud service providers to adequately safeguard their systems and prevent cyber-attacks could disrupt our operations, the operations of a portfolio company or the operations of our or their service providers and result in misappropriation, corruption or loss of personal, confidential or proprietary information or the inability to conduct ordinary business operations. In addition, there is a risk that encryption and other protective measures may be circumvented, particularly to the extent that new computing technologies increase the speed and computing power available. Extended periods of remote working, whether by us, our portfolio companies, or our service providers, could strain technology resources, introduce operational risks and otherwise heighten the risks described above. Remote working environments may be less secure and more susceptible to hacking attacks, including phishing and social engineering attempts. Accordingly, the risks described above, are heightened under the current conditions. 

As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our information systems, both internal and those provided by third-party service providers. We cannot guarantee that third parties and infrastructure in our networks or our partners&#8217; networks have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable defects or bugs that could result in a breach of or disruption to our information technology systems or the third-party information technology systems that support our services. Our ability to monitor these third parties&#8217; information security practices is limited, and they may not have adequate information security measures in place. 

We have implemented processes, procedures and internal controls to help mitigate cybersecurity risks and cyber intrusions, but these measures, as well as our increased awareness of the nature and extent of a risk of a cyber-incident, do not guarantee that a cyber-incident will not occur and/or that our financial results, operations or confidential information will not be negatively impacted by such an incident. 

Finally, cybersecurity has become a top priority for global lawmakers and regulators around the world, and some jurisdictions have proposed or enacted laws requiring companies to notify regulators and individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of personal data. Compliance with such laws and regulations may result in cost increases due to system changes and the development of new administrative processes. If we or our Adviser or certain of its affiliates, fail to comply with the relevant and increasing laws and regulations, we could suffer financial losses, a disruption of our businesses, liability to investors, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. 

We are dependent on information systems and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business, which may, in turn, negatively affect our liquidity, financial condition or results of operations. 

Our business is dependent on our and third parties&#8217; communications and information systems. Any failure or interruption of those systems, including as a result of the termination of an agreement with any third-party service providers, could cause delays or other problems in our activities. Our financial, accounting, data processing, portfolio monitoring, backup or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. There could be: 

&#8226; sudden electrical or telecommunications outages; 

&#8226; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes; 

&#8226; disease pandemics; 

&#8226; events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; 

&#8226; outages due to idiosyncratic issues at specific service providers; and 

&#8226; cyber-attacks. 

These events, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and negatively affect the net asset value of our common stock and our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders. 

Increased data protection regulation may result in increased complexities and risk in connection with the operation of our business. 

Our business is highly dependent on information systems and technology. The costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. Cybersecurity has become a priority for regulators in the U.S. and around the world. Recently, the SEC adopted new rules related to cybersecurity risk management for registered investment advisers, registered investment companies and business development companies, as well as amendments to certain rules that govern investment adviser and fund disclosures. In July 2023, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to disclose material cybersecurity incidents on Form 8-K and periodic disclosure of a registrant&#8217;s cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance in annual reports. The rules became effective beginning with annual reports for fiscal years ending on or after December 15, 2023 and beginning with Form 8-Ks on December 18, 2023. The SEC has also particularly focused on cybersecurity, and we expect increased scrutiny of our policies and systems designed to manage our cybersecurity risks and our related disclosures as a result. We also expect to face increased costs to comply with the new SEC rules, including increased costs for cybersecurity training and management. 

Many jurisdictions in which we operate have laws and regulations relating to data privacy, cybersecurity and And/or information security to which we may be subject (collectively, &#8220;Privacy Laws&#8221;). Compliance with applicable Privacy Laws may require adhering to stringent legal and operational requirements, which could increase compliance costs for us and require the 

dedication of additional time and resources to compliance. A failure to comply with applicable Data Protection Legislation could result in fines, sanctions, enforcement actions or other penalties or reputational damage. In addition, the SEC has indicated in recent periods that one of its examination priorities for the Division of Examinations is to continue to examine cybersecurity procedures and controls, including testing the implementation of these procedures and controls. 

There may be substantial financial penalties or fines for a failure to comply with applicable Privacy Laws (which may include insufficient security for our personal or other sensitive information). For example, failure to comply with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (the &#8220;GDPR&#8221;) and the GDPR as it forms part of the laws of England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland (the &#8220;UK GDPR&#8221;) could (in the worst case) attract regulatory penalties up to the greater of (i) 20 million Euros in respect of the GDPR / &#163;17.5 million in respect of the UK GDPR (as applicable), and (ii) 4% of group annual worldwide turnover, as well as the possibility of other enforcement actions (such as suspension of processing activities and audits), and liabilities from third-party claims. 

Our operations will be impacted by a growing movement to adopt comprehensive privacy and data protection laws similar to the GDPR, including in the U.S., where such laws focus on privacy as an individual right in general. For example, the State of California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (as amended, the &#8220;CCPA&#8221;), which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA generally applies to businesses that collect personal information about California consumers and meet certain thresholds with respect to revenue or buying and/or selling consumers&#8217; personal information. The CCPA imposes stringent legal and operational obligations on such businesses as well as certain affiliated entities that share common branding. The CCPA is enforceable by the California Attorney General. Additionally, if unauthorized access, theft, or disclosure of a consumer&#8217;s personal information occurs, and the business did not maintain reasonable security practices, consumers could file a civil action (including a class action) without having to prove actual damages. Statutory damages range from $100 to $750 per consumer per incident, or actual damages, whichever is greater. The California Attorney General also may impose civil penalties ranging from $2,500 to $7,500 per violation. Further, California passed the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (the &#8220;CPRA&#8221;) to amend and extend the protections of the CCPA. Under the CPRA, which became effective on January 1, 2023, California established a new state agency focused on the enforcement of its privacy laws, leading to greater levels of enforcement and greater costs related to compliance with the CCPA and CPRA. 

Other jurisdictions, including other states in the United States, have either passed, proposed, adopted or are considering similar laws and regulations to the CCPA, CPRA and GDPR, which could impose similarly significant costs, potential liabilities and operational and legal obligations. Further, the fund&#8217;s portfolio companies and/or each of their affiliates are subject to regulations related to privacy, data protection and information security in the jurisdictions in which they do business. Such laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, thus increasing costs, operational and legal burdens and the potential for significant liability on regulated entities. 

Non-compliance with any applicable Privacy Laws represents a serious risk to our business. Some jurisdictions have also enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of personal information. Breaches in security could potentially jeopardize our, our employees&#8217; or our product investors&#8217; or counterparties&#8217; confidential or other information processed and stored in, or transmitted through, our computer systems and networks (or those of our third party vendors), or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, our employees&#8217;, our product investors&#8217;, our counterparties&#8217; or third parties&#8217; operations, which could result in significant losses, increased costs, disruption of our business, liability to our product investors and other counterparties, fines or penalties, litigation, regulatory intervention or reputational damage, which could also lead to loss of product investors or clients. 

Finally, there continues to be significant evolution and developments in the use of artificial intelligence technologies, such as ChatGPT. We cannot fully determine the impact or cybersecurity risk of such evolving technology to our business at this time. We may incorporate, directly or through third-party vendors, the use of artificial intelligence (&#8220;AI&#8221;) into our business and operations, and anticipate that usage and adoption of AI in the marketplace will continue to grow. As with many disruptive innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its accuracy adoption and therefore our business. While we intend the use of any AI to make processes more efficient, AI models may not achieve sufficient levels of accuracy. AI algorithms may be flawed, the datasets on which such algorithms are trained may be insufficient, raise privacy concerns or contain biased information, which could undermine the decisions, predictions or analysis of AI applications produce, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm. A number of jurisdictions have passed laws and implemented regulations, or are considering the same, related to the use of AI and affecting AI companies, which could limit or adversely affect our business. 

Further, we may not be able to control how third-party AI technologies that we choose to use are developed or maintained, or how data we input is used or disclosed, even where we have sought contractual protections with respect to these matters. The misuse or misappropriation of our data could have an adverse impact on our reputation and could subject us to legal and regulatory investigations and/or actions. 

We and our portfolio companies are subject to increasing scrutiny from certain investors, third party assessors and our shareholders with respect to ESG-related topics. 

We and our portfolio companies face increasing scrutiny from certain investors, third party assessors that measure companies&#8217; ESG performance and our shareholders related to ESG-related topics, including in relation to diversity and inclusion, human rights, environmental stewardship, support for local communities, corporate governance and transparency. For example, we and the companies in which we invest risk damage to our brands and reputations if we or they do not act (or are perceived to not act) responsibly either with respect to responsible investing processes or ESG-related practices. Adverse incidents related to ESG practices could impact the value of our brand or the companies in which we invest, or the cost of our or their operations and relationships with investors, all of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, there can be no assurance that any of our Adviser&#8217;s ESG initiatives, or commitments will meet the standards or expectations of our shareholders or other stakeholders. There 

can be no assurance that our Adviser will be able to accomplish any goals related to responsible investing or ESG practices, as statements regarding its ESG and responsible investing commitments and priorities reflect its current estimates, plans and/or aspirations and are not guarantees that it will be able to achieve them within the timelines announced or at all. Additionally, the Adviser may determine in its discretion that it is not feasible or practical to implement or complete certain aspects of its responsible investing program or ESG initiatives based on cost, timing or other considerations. 

In recent years, certain investors have placed increasing importance on policies and practices related to responsible investing and ESG for the products to which they commit capital, and investors may decide not to commit capital to future fundraises based on their assessment of the Adviser&#8217;s approach to and consideration of ESG-related issues or risks. Similarly, a variety of organizations measure the performance of companies on ESG topics, and the results of these assessments are widely publicized. If the Adviser&#8217;s responsible investing or ESG-related practices or ratings do not meet the standards set by such investors or organizations, or if the Adviser receives a negative rating or assessment from any such organization, or if the Adviser fail, or is perceived to fail, to demonstrate progress toward its ESG priorities and initiatives, they may choose not to invest in us, and we may face reputational damage. Similarly, it is expected that investor and/or shareholder demands will require the Adviser to spend additional resources and place increasing importance on business relevant ESG factors in its review of prospective investments and management of existing ones. Devoting additional resources to our responsible investing or ESG-related practices could increase the amount of expenses we or our investments are required to bear. For example, collecting, measuring, and reporting ESG information and metrics can be costly, difficult and time consuming, is subject to evolving reporting standards, and can present numerous operational, reputational, financial, legal and other risks. To the extent our access to capital from investors focused on ESG ratings or ESG-related matters is impaired, we may not be able to maintain or increase the size of our existing products or raise sufficient capital for new products, which may adversely affect our revenues. Further, growing interest on the part of investors and regulators in ESG-related topics and themes and increased demand for, and scrutiny of, ESG-related disclosure by asset managers, have also increased the risk that asset managers could be perceived as, or accused of, making inaccurate or misleading statements regarding the ESG-related investment strategies of their and their funds&#8217; responsible investing or ESG-related efforts or initiatives, or &#8220;greenwashing.&#8221; This risk may also materialize where ESG-related statements and/or disclosures made by our portfolio companies are materially inconsistent with our ESG-related statements or disclosures, including those made on a voluntary basis or pursuant to any applicable regulation, such as Regulation EU 2019/2088 on sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services sector (&#8220;SFDR&#8221;) or the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (&#8220;CSRD.&#8221;) Such perception or accusation could damage our reputation, result in litigation or regulatory actions and adversely impact our ability to raise capital. 

At the same time, various stakeholders may have differing approaches to responsible investing activities or divergent views on the consideration of ESG topics. These differing views increase the risk that any action or lack thereof with respect to our Adviser&#8217;s consideration of responsible investing or ESG-related practices will be perceived negatively. A growing number of states have enacted or proposed &#8220;anti-ESG&#8221; policies, legislation, issued related legal opinions and engaged in related litigation. For example: (i) boycott bills target financial institutions that &#8220;boycott&#8221; or &#8220;discriminate against&#8221; companies in certain industries (e.g., energy and mining) and prohibit state entities from doing business with such institutions and/or investing the state&#8217;s assets (including pension plan assets) through such institutions and (ii) ESG investment prohibitions require that state entities or managers/administrators of state investments make investments based solely on pecuniary factors without consideration of ESG factors. If investors subject to such legislation view our responsible investing or ESG practices as being in contradiction of such &#8220;anti-ESG&#8221; policies, legislation or legal opinions, such investors may not invest in us and it could negatively affect the results of operations or cash flows. Further, asset managers have been subject to recent scrutiny related to ESG-focused industry working groups, initiatives and associations, including organizations advancing action to address climate change or climate-related risk. In addition, state attorneys general, among others, have asserted that the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision striking down race-based affirmative action in higher education in June 2023 should be analogized to private employment matters and private contract matters. Cases alleging discrimination based on similar arguments have been filed since that decision, with scrutiny of certain corporate DEI practices increasing throughout 2024. Additionally, in January 2025, the new U.S. Presidential administration signed a number of executive orders focused on DEI (the &#8220;Executive Orders&#8221;), which include a broad mandate to eliminate federal DEI programs and a caution to the private sector to end what may be viewed as illegal DEI discrimination and preferences. The Executive Orders also indicate upcoming compliance investigations of private entities, including publicly traded companies, and changes to federal contracting regulations. If the Adviser does not successfully manage expectations across these varied stakeholder interests, it could erode stakeholder trust, impact our reputation and/or constrain our investment and fundraising opportunities. Such scrutiny of both ESG and DEI related practices could expose the Adviser to the risk of investigations or challenges by federal authorities, result in reputational harm and discourage certain investors from investing in us. 

We are subject to increasing scrutiny with respect to ESG-related issues and the regulatory disclosure landscape surrounding related topics continues to evolve. 

Responsible investing, ESG practices and ESG-related disclosures have been the subject of increased focus by certain regulators, and regulatory initiatives related to ESG-specific topics that are applicable to us, our products and our products&#8217; portfolio companies could adversely affect our business. There has been a growing regulatory interest across jurisdictions in improving transparency regarding the definition, measurement and disclosure of ESG factors in order to allow investors to validate and better understand sustainability claims, including in the United States, the European Union and the United Kingdom. 

For example, in March 2024, the SEC adopted final rules intended to enhance and standardize climate-related disclosures; however, these rules are stayed pending the outcome of consolidated legal challenges in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. Further, the SEC sometimes reviews compliance with ESG commitments in examinations, and it has taken enforcement actions against registered investment advisers for not establishing adequate or consistently implementing ESG policies and procedures to meet ESG commitments to investors. 

In addition, in October 2023, California enacted legislation that will ultimately require certain companies that (i) do business in California to publicly disclose their Scopes 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions, with third party assurance of such data, and issue public reports on their climate-related financial risk and related mitigation measures and (ii) operate in California and make certain climate-related claims to provide enhanced disclosures around the achievement of climate-related claims, including the use of voluntary carbon credits to achieve such claims. From a European perspective, the European Union has adopted legislation aimed at increasing transparency for investors of sustainability-related policies, processes, performance and commitments which apply to certain of our products, including, without limitation: (a) the SFDR, for which most rules took effect beginning on March 10, 2021 and (b) Regulation (EU) 2020/852 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment and amending the SDFR. Further, the European Commission is currently considering whether to propose further changes or amendments to the SFDR and the associated regulatory framework. Relatedly, the European Securities and Markets Authority (&#8220;ESMA&#8221;) has identified promoting transparency through effective sustainability disclosures and addressing greenwashing as one of its key priorities per ESMA&#8217;s sustainable finance roadmap and strategy. ESMA has also introduced guidelines on funds with ESG, impact, transition or sustainability-related terms in their names. 

There are still some uncertainties regarding the operation of some of these requirements and how they might evolve, and an established market practice is still being developed in certain cases, which can lead to diverging implementation and/or operationalization, data gaps or methodological challenges which may affect our ability to collect relevant data. These regimes continue to evolve and there is still a lack of clarity and established practice around the approach to their supervision and enforcement, which may vary across national competent authorities. There is a risk that a development or reorientation in the regulatory requirements or market practice in this respect could be adverse to our investments if they are perceived to be less valuable as a consequence of, among other things, their carbon footprint or perceived &#8220;greenwashing.&#8221; Compliance with requirements of this nature may also increase risks relating to financial supervision and enforcement action. There is the additional risk that market expectations in relation to certain commitments under the SFDR, such as disclosures made in relation to financial products, could adversely affect our ability to raise capital, especially from EEA investors. 

There are a variety of other regulatory initiatives related to ESG-specific topics that may be applicable to us, our products or our products&#8217; portfolio companies. For example, on January 5, 2023, the CSRD came into effect. The CSRD amends and strengthens the rules introduced on sustainability reporting for companies, banks and insurance companies under the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (2014/95/EU) (&#8220;NFRD&#8221;). The CSRD requires a much broader range of companies, including non-EU companies with significant turnover and a legal presence in EU markets, to produce detailed and prescriptive reports on sustainability-related matters within their financial statements. Although we are not currently directly in-scope of CSRD, it is possible that we may become subject to CSRD. This may result in additional compliance burdens and increased legal, accounting and compliance costs and enhanced disclosure obligations. 

In November 2023, the Sustainability Labelling and Disclosure of Sustainability-Related Financial Information Instrument 2023 (&#8220;SDR&#8221;) introduced sustainability disclosure requirements, voluntary investment product labels and an &#8216;anti-greenwashing&#8217; rule. The anti-greenwashing rule applies to all UK-authorized firms in relation to sustainability-related claims made in their communications, and/or communications of financial promotions with, clients in the UK. The balance of the new regime is currently directed at UK investment funds and UK-regulated asset management firms as well as distributors of such funds; however, the FCA consulted in Spring 2024 as to whether to extend the SDR to portfolio management, and the UK Government also announced in May 2024 its intention to launch a consultation on whether to extend the scope of SDR to overseas funds. 

In Asia, examples of ESG-related regulations including those by regulators in Singapore and Hong Kong, have released guidelines for asset managers to integrate climate risk considerations in investment and risk management processes, together with enhanced disclosure and reporting and have also issued enhanced rules for certain ESG funds on general ESG risk management and disclosure. 

As a result of these and other legislative and regulatory initiatives, and as our business grows through acquisition activity or changes to our structure, we or the Adviser may be required to provide additional disclosure to our investors with respect to ESG matters. This exposes us to increased disclosure risks, for example due to a lack of available or credible data, and the potential for conflicting disclosures may also expose us to an increased risk of misstatement litigation or miss-selling allegations. Failure to manage these risks could result in a material adverse effect on our business in a number of ways. Compliance with frameworks of this nature may create an additional compliance burden and increased legal, compliance, governance, reporting and other costs to funds and/or fund managers because of the need to collect certain information to meet the disclosure requirements. In addition, where there are uncertainties regarding the operation of the framework, a lack of official, conflicting or inconsistent regulatory guidance, a lack of established market practice and/or data gaps or methodological challenges affecting the ability to collect relevant data, funds and/or fund managers may be required to engage third party advisers and/or service providers to fulfil the requirements, thereby exacerbating any increase in compliance burden and costs. To the extent that any applicable jurisdictions enact similar laws and/or frameworks, there is a risk that we may not be able to maintain alignment of a particular investment with such frameworks, and/or may be subject to additional compliance burdens and costs, which might adversely affect us. 

Risks Related to Our Adviser and Its Affiliates 

Our Adviser and its affiliates, including our officers and some of our directors, may face conflicts of interest caused by compensation arrangements with us and our affiliates, which could result in increased risk-taking or speculative investments, or cause our Adviser to use substantial leverage. 

Our Adviser and its affiliates receive fees from us in return for their services. These fees may include certain incentive fees based on the amount of appreciation of our investments and arrangement, structuring or similar fees from portfolio companies in 

which we invest. These fees could influence the advice provided to us or create an incentive for our Adviser to make investments on our behalf that are risky or more speculative than would be the case in the absence of such incentive fees. Generally, the more equity we sell in public offerings and the greater the risk assumed by us with respect to our investments, including through the use of leverage, the greater the potential for growth in our assets and profits, and, correlatively, the fees payable by us to our Adviser. The way in which the incentive fee is determined may encourage our Adviser to use leverage to increase the leveraged return on our investment portfolio. 

In addition, the fact that our base management fee is payable based upon our net assets (which includes any borrowings used for investment purposes) may encourage our Adviser to use leverage to make additional investments. Such a practice could make such investments more risky than would otherwise be the case, which could result in higher investment losses, particularly during cyclical economic downturns. Under certain circumstances, the use of substantial leverage (up to the limits prescribed by the 1940 Act) may increase the likelihood of our defaulting on our borrowings, which would be detrimental to holders of our securities. 

These compensation arrangements could affect our Adviser&#8217;s or its affiliates&#8217; judgment with respect to public offerings of equity, incurrence of debt, and investments made by us, which allow our Adviser to earn increased asset management fees. 

The time and resources that individuals associated with our Adviser devote to us may be diverted, and we may face additional competition due to, among other things, the fact that neither our Adviser nor its affiliates is prohibited from raising money for or managing another entity that makes the same types of investments that we target. 

Blue Owl is not prohibited from raising money for and managing future investment entities, in addition to the Blue Owl Credit Clients, that make the same or similar types of investments as those we target. As a result, the time and resources that our Adviser devotes to us may be diverted, and during times of intense activity in other investment programs they may devote less time and resources to our business than is necessary or appropriate. In addition, we may compete with any such investment entity also managed by our Adviser or its affiliates for the same investors and investment opportunities. Furthermore, certain members of the Diversified Lending Investment Committee or our affiliates are officers of Blue Owl and will devote a portion of their time to the operations of Blue Owl, including with respect to public company compliance. 

Our Adviser and its affiliates may face conflicts of interest with respect to services performed for issuers in which we may invest. 

Our Adviser and its affiliates may provide a broad range of financial services to companies in which we may invest, including providing arrangement, syndication, origination structuring and other services to portfolio companies, and will generally be paid fees for such services, in compliance with applicable law, by the portfolio company. Any compensation received by our Adviser or its affiliates for providing these services will not be shared with us and may be received before we realize a return on our investment. In addition, we may invest in companies managed by entities in which funds managed by GP Strategic Capital have acquired a minority interest. Our Adviser and its affiliates may face conflicts of interest with respect to services performed for these companies, on the one hand, and investments recommended to us, on the other hand and could, in certain instances, have an incentive not to pursue actions against a portfolio company that would be in our best interest. 

Our Adviser or its affiliates may have incentives to favor their respective other accounts and clients and/or Blue Owl over us, which may result in conflicts of interest that could be harmful to us. 

Because our Adviser and its affiliates manage assets for, or may in the future manage assets for, other investment companies, pooled investment vehicles and/or other accounts (including institutional clients, pension plans, insurance companies, co-invest vehicles and certain high net worth individuals), including the Blue Owl Credit Clients, and we may compete for capital and investment opportunities with these entities, certain conflicts of interest are present. These include conflicts of interest relating to the allocation of investment opportunities by our Adviser and its affiliates; compensation to our Adviser; services that may be provided by our Adviser and its affiliates to issuers in which we may invest; investments by us and other clients of our Adviser, subject to the limitations of the 1940 Act; the formation of additional investment funds managed by our Adviser; differing recommendations given by our Adviser to us versus other clients; our Adviser&#8217;s use of information gained from issuers in our portfolio for investments by other clients, subject to applicable law; restrictions on our Adviser&#8217;s use of &#8220;inside information&#8221; with respect to potential investments by us; the allocation of certain expenses; and cross transactions. 

For instance, our Adviser and its affiliates may receive asset management performance-based, or other fees from certain accounts that are higher than the fees received by our Adviser from us. In addition, certain members of Blue Owl&#8217;s Credit platform&#8217;s investment committees and other executives and employees of our Adviser or its affiliates will hold and receive interest in Blue Owl and its affiliates, in addition to cash and carried interest compensation. In these instances, a portfolio manager for our Adviser may have an incentive to favor the higher fee and/or performance-based fee accounts over us and/or to favor Blue Owl. In addition, a conflict of interest exists to the extent our Adviser, its affiliates, or any of their respective executives, portfolio managers or employees have proprietary or personal investments in other investment companies or accounts or when certain other investment companies or accounts are investment options in our Adviser&#8217;s or its affiliates&#8217; employee benefit plans or employee offerings. In these circumstances, personnel of our Adviser may have incentive to favor these other investment companies or accounts over us. 

Because our Adviser may have incentive to favor other Blue Owl Credit Clients and we may compete for investments with Blue Owl Credit Clients, our Adviser and its affiliates are subject to certain conflicts of interest in evaluating the suitability of investment opportunities and making or recommending investments on our behalf. To mitigate these conflicts, the Blue Owl Credit Advisers will seek to execute such transactions for all of the participating investment accounts, including us, on a fair and equitable basis and in accordance with the Blue Owl Credit Advisers&#8217; investment allocation policy, taking into account such factors as the relative amounts of capital available for new investments; cash on hand; existing commitments and reserves; the investment programs and portfolio positions of the participating investment accounts, including portfolio construction, diversification and concentration 

considerations; the investment objectives, guidelines and strategies of each client; the clients for which participation is appropriate&#8217; each client&#8217;s life cycle; targeted leverage level; targeted asset mix and any other factors deemed appropriate. We may be prohibited under the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, the prior approval of the SEC. We, our Adviser and certain affiliates have been granted exemptive relief by the SEC to permit us to co-invest with other funds managed by our Adviser or certain of its affiliates in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. See &#8220; &#8212;Our ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates is restricted. &#8221; 

Actions taken by our Adviser and its affiliates on behalf of the Blue Owl Credit Clients as a result of any conflict of interest may be adverse to us, which could harm our performance. For example, we may invest in the same credit obligations as other Blue Owl Credit Clients, although, to the extent permitted under the 1940 Act, our investments may include different obligations or levels of the capital structure of the same issuer. Decisions made with respect to the securities held by one of the Blue Owl Credit Clients may cause (or have the potential to cause) harm to the different class of securities of the issuer held by other Blue Owl Credit Clients (including us). While the Blue Owl Credit Advisers and their affiliates have developed general guidelines regarding when two or more funds can invest in different parts of the same company&#8217;s capital structure and created a process that they employ to handle those conflicts when they arise, their decision to permit the investments to occur in the first instance or their judgment on how to mitigate the conflict could be challenged or deemed insufficient. If the Blue Owl Credit Advisers and their affiliates fail to appropriately address those conflicts, it could negatively impact their reputation and ability to raise additional funds and the willingness of counterparties to do business with them or result in potential litigation against them. 

From time to time, fees and expenses generated in connection with potential portfolio investments that are not consummated may be allocable to us and one or more Blue Owl Credit Clients. These expenses will be allocated in a manner that is fair and equitable over time and in accordance with policies adopted by the Blue Owl Credit Advisers and the Investment Advisory Agreement; however, the method for allocation expenses may vary depending on the nature of the expense and such determinations involve inherent discretion. 

In addition, from time to time, our Adviser could cause us to purchase a security or other investment from, or sell a security or other investment to, another Blue Owl Credit Client. Such cross transaction would be in accordance with applicable regulations and our and our Adviser&#8217;s valuation and cross-trades policies; however, such cross transactions could give rise to additional conflicts of interest. 

Our Board will seek to monitor these conflicts but there can be no assurances that such monitoring will fully mitigate any such conflicts. 

The Adviser may have an incentive to delay a liquidity event, which may result in actions that are not in the best interest of our shareholders. 

The ongoing servicing fee is payable by us to compensate our affiliated Dealer Manager and its affiliates for services rendered to shareholders, including, among other things, responding to customer inquiries of a general nature regarding the Company; crediting distributions from us to customer accounts; arranging for bank wire transfer of funds to or from a customer&#8217;s account; responding to customer inquiries and requests regarding shareholder reports, notices, proxies and proxy statements, and other Company documents; forwarding prospectuses, tax notices and annual and quarterly reports to beneficial owners of our shares; assisting us in establishing and maintaining shareholder accounts and records; assisting customers in changing account options, account designations and account addresses, and providing such other similar services as we may reasonably request to the extent the an authorized service provider is permitted to do so under applicable statutes, rules, or regulations. The ongoing servicing fee will terminate for all Class S and Class D shareholders upon a liquidity event. Although we do not intend to complete a liquidity event within any specific time period, if at all, the Advisor, an affiliate of our Dealer Manager, may have an incentive to delay a liquidity event if such amounts receivable by our Dealer Manager have not been fully paid. A delay in a liquidity event may not be in the best interests of our shareholders. 

Reductions, waivers or absorptions of fees and costs can temporarily result in higher returns to shareholders than they would otherwise receive if full fees and costs were charged. 

The Adviser and its affiliates are permitted to reduce, waive or absorb some of the fees or costs otherwise due by us. While this activity can be seen as friendly to shareholders, reductions, waivers and absorptions of fees and costs result in higher returns to shareholders than such shareholders would receive if full fees and costs were charged. There is no guarantee that any reductions, waivers or absorptions will occur in the future, and any reductions, waivers and absorptions are entirely at the discretion of the Adviser. 

Products within Blue Owl&#8217;s Real Assets platform may enter into sale lease-back transactions with our portfolio companies or with borrowers under our credit facilities. 

From time to time, companies in which we have invested or may invest, may enter into sale-leaseback transactions with products within Blue Owl&#8217;s Real Assets platform. As a result of these arrangements we could be a creditor to, or equity owners of, a company at the same time that company is a tenant of a product within Blue Owl&#8217;s Real Assets platform. If such a company were to encounter financial difficulty or default on its obligations as a borrower, our Adviser could be required to take actions that may be adverse to those of Blue Owl&#8217;s Real Assets platform in enforcing our rights under the relevant facilities or agreements, or vice versa. This could lead to actual or perceived conflicts of interest. 

Our access to confidential information may restrict our ability to take action with respect to some investments, which, in turn, may negatively affect our results of operations. 

We, directly or through our Adviser, may obtain confidential information about the companies in which we have invested or may invest or be deemed to have such confidential information. Our Adviser may come into possession of material, non-public information through its members, officers, directors, employees, principals or affiliates. In addition, funds managed by GP Strategic Capital may invest in entities that manage our portfolio companies and, as a result, may obtain additional confidential information about our portfolio companies. The possession of such information may, to our detriment, limit the ability of us and our Adviser to buy or sell a security or otherwise to participate in an investment opportunity. In certain circumstances, employees of our Adviser may serve as board members or in other capacities for portfolio or potential portfolio companies, which could restrict our ability to trade in the securities of such companies. For example, if personnel of our Adviser come into possession of material non-public information with respect to our investments, such personnel will be restricted by our Adviser&#8217;s information-sharing policies and procedures or by law or contract from sharing such information with our management team, even where the disclosure of such information would be in our best interests or would otherwise influence decisions taken by the members of the management team with respect to that investment. This conflict and these procedures and practices may limit the freedom of our Adviser to enter into or exit from potentially profitable investments for us, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully leverage the resources and industry expertise of our Adviser in the course of its duties. Additionally, there may be circumstances in which one or more individuals associated with our Adviser will be precluded from providing services to us because of certain confidential information available to those individuals or to other parts of our Adviser. 

We may be obligated to pay our Adviser incentive fees even if we incur a net loss due to a decline in the value of our portfolio and even if our earned interest income is not payable in cash. 

The Investment Advisory Agreement entitles our Adviser to receive an incentive fee based on our pre-incentive fee net investment income regardless of any capital losses. In such case, we may be required to pay our Adviser an incentive fee for a fiscal quarter even if there is a decline in the value of our portfolio or if we incur a net loss for that quarter. 

Any incentive fee payable by us that relates to the pre-incentive fee net investment income may be computed and paid on income that may include interest that has been accrued but not yet received or interest in the form of securities received rather than cash (&#8220;payment-in-kind&#8221; or &#8220;PIK&#8221; income&#8221;). PIK income will be included in the pre-incentive fee net investment income used to calculate the incentive fee to our Adviser even though we do not receive the income in the form of cash. If a portfolio company defaults on a loan that is structured to provide accrued interest income, it is possible that accrued interest income previously included in the calculation of the incentive fee will become uncollectible. Our Adviser is not obligated to reimburse us for any part of the incentive fee it received that was based on accrued interest income that we never receive as a result of a subsequent default. 

The quarterly incentive fee on income is recognized and paid without regard to: (i) the trend of pre-incentive fee net investment income as a percent of adjusted capital over multiple quarters in arrears which may in fact be consistently less than the quarterly preferred return, or (ii) the net income or net loss in the current calendar quarter, the current year or any combination of prior periods. 

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may be required to recognize taxable income in some circumstances in which we do not receive a corresponding payment in cash and to make distributions with respect to such income to maintain our tax treatment as a RIC and/or minimize corporate-level U.S. federal income or excise tax. Under such circumstances, we may have difficulty meeting the Annual Distribution Requirement necessary to maintain RIC tax treatment under the Code. This difficulty in making the required distribution may be amplified to the extent that we are required to pay the incentive fee on income with respect to such accrued income. As a result, we may have to sell some of our investments at times and/or at prices we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital, or forgo new investment opportunities for this purpose. If we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment and thus become subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax. 

Our ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates is restricted. 

We are prohibited under the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with certain of our affiliates without the prior approval of a majority of our independent directors and, in some cases, the SEC. Any person that owns, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of our outstanding voting securities will be our affiliate for purposes of the 1940 Act, and we will generally be prohibited from buying or selling any securities from or to such affiliate on a principal basis, absent the prior approval of our Board and, in some cases, the SEC. The 1940 Act also prohibits certain &#8220;joint&#8221; transactions with certain of our affiliates, including other funds or clients advised by our Adviser or its affiliates, which in certain circumstances could include investments in the same portfolio company (whether at the same or different times to the extent the transaction involves a joint investment), without prior approval of our Board and, in some cases, the SEC. If a person acquires more than 25% of our voting securities, we will be prohibited from buying or selling any security from or to such person or certain of that person&#8217;s affiliates, or entering into prohibited joint transactions with such persons, absent the prior approval of the SEC. Similar restrictions limit our ability to transact business with our officers or directors or their affiliates or anyone who is under common control with us. The SEC has interpreted the BDC regulations governing transactions with affiliates to prohibit certain joint transactions involving entities that share a common investment adviser. As a result of these restrictions, we may be prohibited from buying or selling any security from or to any portfolio company that is controlled by a fund managed by either of our Adviser or its affiliates without the prior approval of the SEC, which may limit the scope of investment or disposition opportunities that would otherwise be available to us. 

Our Adviser and certain of our affiliates have received an order for exemptive relief (as amended, the &#8220;Order&#8221;) from the SEC, on which we are permitted to rely, that permit us to co-invest with other funds managed by our Adviser or its affiliates in a manner 

consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. Pursuant to the Order, we generally are permitted to co-invest with certain of our affiliates if a &#8220;required majority&#8221; (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our shareholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of us or our shareholders on the part of any person concerned, (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our shareholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies, (3) the investment by our affiliates would not disadvantage us, and our participation would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that on which our affiliates are investing, and (4) the proposed investment by us would not benefit our Adviser, the other affiliated funds that are participating in the investment or any affiliated person of any of them (other than the parties to the transaction), except to the extent permitted by the Order and applicable law, including the limitations set forth in Section 57(k) of the 1940 Act. In addition, we have received an amendment to our Order to permit us to participate in follow-on investments in our existing portfolio companies with certain Affiliated Funds when such private funds are not invested in such existing portfolio company. 

In situations when co-investment with our Adviser&#8217;s or its affiliates&#8217; other clients is not permitted under the 1940 Act and related rules, existing or future staff guidance, or the terms and conditions of the exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC, our Adviser will need to decide which client or clients will proceed with the investment. Generally, we will not be entitled to make a co-investment in these circumstances and, to the extent that another client elects to proceed with the investment, we will not be permitted to participate. Moreover, except in certain circumstances, we will not invest in any issuer in which an affiliate&#8217;s other client holds a controlling interest. 

We may make investments that could give rise to a conflict of interest. 

We do not expect to invest in, or hold securities of, companies that are controlled by an affiliate&#8217;s other clients. However, our Adviser or an affiliate&#8217;s other clients may invest in, and gain control over, one of our portfolio companies. If our Adviser or an affiliate&#8217;s other client, or clients, gains control over one of our portfolio companies, it may create conflicts of interest and may subject us to certain restrictions under the 1940 Act. As a result of these conflicts and restrictions our Adviser may be unable to implement our investment strategies as effectively as they could have in the absence of such conflicts or restrictions. For example, as a result of a conflict or restriction, our Adviser may be unable to engage in certain transactions that it would otherwise pursue. In order to avoid these conflicts and restrictions, our Adviser may choose to exit such investments prematurely and, as a result, we may forego any positive returns associated with such investments. In addition, to the extent that an affiliate&#8217;s other client holds a different class of securities than us as a result of such transactions, our interests may not be aligned. 

The recommendations given to us by our Adviser may differ from those rendered to their other clients. 

Our Adviser and its affiliates may give advice and recommend securities to other clients which may differ from advice given to, or securities recommended or bought for, us even though such other clients&#8217; investment objectives may be similar to ours, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Our Adviser&#8217;s liability is limited under the Investment Advisory Agreement, and we are required to indemnify our Adviser against certain liabilities, which may lead our Adviser to act in a riskier manner on our behalf than it would when acting for its own account. 

Our Adviser has not assumed any responsibility to us other than to render the services described in the Investment Advisory Agreement (and, separately, under the Administration Agreement), and it will not be responsible for any action of our Board in declining to follow our Adviser&#8217;s advice or recommendations. Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, our Adviser and its directors, officers, shareholders, members, agents, employees, controlling persons, and any other person or entity affiliated with, or acting on behalf of our Adviser will not be liable to us for their acts under the Investment Advisory Agreement, absent criminal conduct, willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of their duties. We have also agreed to indemnify, defend and protect our Adviser and its directors, officers, shareholders, members, agents, employees, controlling persons and any other person or entity affiliated with, or acting on behalf of our Adviser with respect to all damages, liabilities, costs and expenses resulting from acts of our Adviser not arising out of criminal conduct, willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of their duties. However, in accordance with Section 17(i) of the 1940 Act, neither our Adviser nor any of its affiliates, directors, officers, members, employees, agents, or representatives may be protected against any liability to us or our investors to which it would otherwise be subject by reason of criminal conduct, willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of its office. These protections may lead our Adviser to act in a riskier manner when acting on our behalf than it would when acting for its own account. 

There are risks associated with any potential merger with or purchase of assets of another fund. 

Our Adviser may in the future recommend to our Board that we merge with or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of one or more funds including a fund that could be managed by our Adviser or its affiliates (including another BDC). We do not expect that our Adviser would recommend any such merger or asset purchase unless it determines that it would be in our best interests, with such determination dependent on factors it deems relevant, which may include our historical and projected financial performance and that of any proposed merger partner, portfolio composition, potential synergies from the merger or asset sale, available alternative options and market conditions. In addition, no such merger or asset purchase would be consummated absent the meeting of various conditions required by applicable law or contract, at such time, which may include approval of the board of directors and common equity holders of both funds. If our Adviser is the investment adviser of both funds, various conflicts of interest would exist with respect to any such transaction. Such conflicts of interest may potentially arise from, among other things, differences between the 

compensation payable to our Adviser by us and by the entity resulting from such a merger or asset purchase or efficiencies or other benefits to our Adviser as a result of managing a single, larger fund instead of two separate funds. 

Our Adviser&#8217;s failure to comply with pay-to-play laws, regulations and policies could have an adverse effect on our Adviser, and thus, us. 

A number of U.S. states and municipal pension plans have adopted so-called &#8220;pay-to-play&#8221; laws, regulations or policies which prohibit, restrict or require disclosure of payments to (and/or certain contacts with) state officials by individuals and entities seeking to do business with state entities, including those seeking investments by public retirement funds. The SEC has adopted a rule that, among other things, prohibits an investment adviser from providing advisory services for compensation to a government client for two years after the adviser or certain of its executives or employees makes a contribution to certain elected officials or candidates. If our Adviser, any of its employees or affiliates or any service provider acting on its behalf, fails to comply with such laws, regulations or policies, such non-compliance could have an adverse effect on our Adviser, and thus, us. 

Our Adviser&#8217;s inability to attract, retain and develop human capital in a highly competitive talent market could have an adverse effect on our Adviser, and thus us. 

The success of our business will continue to depend upon our Adviser attracting, developing and retaining human capital. Competition for qualified, motivated, and highly-skilled executives, professionals and other key personnel in asset management firms is significant. Turnover and associated costs of rehiring, the loss of human capital through attrition, death, or disability and the reduced ability to attract talent could impair our Adviser&#8217;s ability to maintain its standards of excellence and have an adverse effect on us. 

Our Adviser&#8217;s net worth is not available to satisfy our liabilities and other obligations. 

The North American Securities Administrators Association (&#8220;NASAA&#8221;), in its Omnibus Guidelines Statement of Policy adopted on March 29, 1992 and as amended on May 7, 2007 and from time to time, requires that our affiliates and Adviser, or our Sponsor under the Omnibus Guidelines, have an aggregate financial net worth, exclusive of home, automobiles and home furnishings, of 5.0% of the first $20 million of both the gross amount of securities currently being offered in our offering and the gross amount of any originally issued direct participation program securities sold by our affiliates and sponsors within the past 12 months, plus 1.0% of all amounts in excess of the first $20 million. Based on these requirements, our Adviser and its affiliates have an aggregate financial net worth in excess of those amounts required by the Omnibus Guidelines. However, no portion of such net worth will be available to us to satisfy any of our liabilities or other obligations. The use of our own funds to satisfy such liabilities or other obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Our Class S and Class D shares are each subject to an ongoing servicing fee. 

The ongoing servicing fees will be payable by investors in our Class S and Class D shares to compensate our Dealer Manager and its affiliates, participating broker-dealers and financial representatives for services rendered to shareholders, including, among other things, responding to customer inquiries of a general nature regarding the Company; crediting distributions from us to customer accounts; arranging for bank wire transfer of funds to or from a customer's account; responding to customer inquiries and requests regarding shareholder reports, notices, proxies and proxy statements, and other Company documents; forwarding prospectuses, tax notices and annual and quarterly reports to beneficial owners of our shares; assisting us in establishing and maintaining shareholder accounts and records; assisting customers in changing account options, account designations and account addresses, and providing such other similar services as we may reasonably request to the extent an authorized service provider is permitted to do so under applicable statutes, rules, or regulations. 

Risks Related to Business Development Companies 

The requirement that we invest a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets could preclude us from investing in accordance with our current business strategy; conversely, the failure to invest a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets could result in our failure to maintain our status as a BDC. 

As a BDC, the 1940 Act prohibits us from acquiring any assets other than certain qualifying assets unless, at the time of and after giving effect to such acquisition, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets. Therefore, we may be precluded from investing in what we believe are attractive investments if such investments are not qualifying assets. Conversely, if we fail to invest a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets, we could lose our status as a BDC, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, these rules could prevent us from making additional investments in existing portfolio companies, which could result in the dilution of our position, or could require us to dispose of investments at an inopportune time to comply with the 1940 Act. If we were forced to sell non-qualifying investments in the portfolio for compliance purposes, the proceeds from such sale could be significantly less than the current value of such investments. 

Failure to maintain our status as a BDC would reduce our operating flexibility. 

If we do not remain a BDC, we might be regulated as a closed-end investment company under the 1940 Act, which would subject us to substantially more regulatory restrictions, including a greater required asset coverage ratio and additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates, and correspondingly decrease our operating flexibility. 

Regulations governing our operation as a BDC and RIC affect our ability to raise capital and the way in which we raise additional capital or borrow for investment purposes, which may have a negative effect on our growth. As a BDC, the necessity of raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including risks associated with leverage. 

As a result of the Annual Distribution Requirement to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, we may need to access the capital markets periodically to raise cash to fund new investments in portfolio companies. Currently, we may issue &#8220;senior securities,&#8221; including borrowing money from banks or other financial institutions only in amounts such that the ratio of our total assets (less total liabilities other than indebtedness represented by senior securities) to our total indebtedness represented by senior securities plus preferred stock, if any, equals at least 150% after such incurrence or issuance. If we issue senior securities, we will be exposed to risks associated with leverage, including an increased risk of loss. Our ability to issue different types of securities is also limited. Compliance with RIC distribution requirements may unfavorably limit our investment opportunities and reduce our ability in comparison to other companies to profit from favorable spreads between the rates at which we can borrow and the rates at which we can lend. Therefore, we intend to seek to continuously issue equity securities, which may lead to shareholder dilution. 

We may borrow to fund investments. If the value of our assets declines, we may be unable to satisfy the asset coverage test under the 1940 Act, which would prohibit us from paying distributions and could prevent us from qualifying for tax treatment as a RIC, which would generally result in a corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on any income and net gains. If we cannot satisfy the asset coverage test, we may be required to sell a portion of our investments and, depending on the nature of our debt financing, repay a portion of our indebtedness at a time when such sales may be disadvantageous. Also, any amounts that we use to service our indebtedness would not be available for distribution to our shareholders. 

In addition, as market conditions permit, we have and may continue to securitize our loans to generate cash for funding new investments. To securitize loans, we have and may continue to create a wholly owned subsidiary, contribute a pool of loans to the subsidiary and have the subsidiary issue primarily investment grade debt securities to purchasers who would be expected to be willing to accept a substantially lower interest rate than the loans earn. We have and may continue to retain all or a portion of the equity in the securitized pool of loans. Our retained equity would be exposed to any losses on the portfolio of loans before any of the debt securities would be exposed to such losses. See &#8220; &#8212;W e are subject to certain risks as a result of our interests in the CLO Preferred Shares &#8221;; &#8220; The subordination of the CLO Preferred Shares will affect our right to payment &#8221;; and &#8220; The CLO Indentures require mandatory redemption of the respective CLO Debt for failure to satisfy coverage tests, which would reduce the amounts available for distribution to us. &#8221; 

Risks Related to Our Investments 

Our investments in portfolio companies may be risky, and we could lose all or part of our investments. 

Our strategy focuses primarily on originating and making loans to, and making debt and equity investments in, U.S. middle-market companies, with a focus on originated transactions sourced through the networks of our Adviser. Short transaction closing timeframes associated with originated transactions coupled with added tax or accounting structuring complexity and international transactions may result in higher risk in comparison to non-originated transactions. 

Most debt securities in which we intend to invest will not be rated by any rating agency and, if they were rated, they would be rated as below investment grade quality and are commonly referred to as &#8220;high yield&#8221; or &#8220;junk.&#8221; Debt securities rated below investment grade quality are generally regarded as having predominantly speculative characteristics and may carry a greater risk with respect to a borrower&#8217;s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. In addition, some of the loans in which we may invest may be &#8220;covenant-lite&#8221; loans. We use the term &#8220;covenant-lite&#8221; loans to refer generally to loans that do not have a complete set of financial maintenance covenants. Generally, &#8220;covenant-lite&#8221; loans provide borrower companies more freedom to negatively impact lenders because their covenants are incurrence-based, which means they are only tested and can only be breached following an affirmative action of the borrower, rather than by a deterioration in the borrower&#8217;s financial condition. Accordingly, to the extent we invest in &#8220;covenant-lite&#8221; loans, we may have fewer rights against a borrower and may have a greater risk of loss on such investments as compared to investments in or exposure to loans with financial maintenance covenants. 

First-Lien Debt. When we make a first-lien loan, we generally take a security interest in the available assets of the portfolio company, including the equity interests of its subsidiaries, which we expect to help mitigate the risk that we will not be repaid. However, there is a risk that the collateral securing our loans may decrease in value over time, may be difficult to sell in a timely manner, may be difficult to appraise, and may fluctuate in value based upon the success of the business and market conditions, including as a result of the inability of the portfolio company to raise additional capital. In some circumstances, our lien is, or could become, subordinated to claims of other creditors. Consequently, the fact that a loan is secured does not guarantee that we will receive principal and interest payments according to the loan&#8217;s terms, or at all, or that we will be able to collect on the loan should we need to enforce our remedies. 

Unitranche Loans. In addition, in connection with any unitranche loans (including &#8220;last out&#8221; portions of such loans) in which we may invest, we would enter into agreements among lenders. Under these agreements, our interest in the collateral of the first-lien loans may rank junior to those of other lenders in the loan under certain circumstances. This may result in greater risk and loss of principal on these loans. 

Second-Lien and Mezzanine Debt. Our investments in second-lien and mezzanine debt generally are subordinated to senior loans and will either have junior security interests or be unsecured. As such, other creditors may rank senior to us in the event of insolvency. This may result in greater risk and loss of principal. 

Equity Investments. When we invest in first-lien debt, second-lien debt or mezzanine debt, we may acquire equity securities, such as warrants, options and convertible instruments, as well. In addition, we may invest directly in the equity securities of portfolio companies. We may structure such equity investments to include provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, as well as a &#8220;put,&#8221; or right to sell such securities back to the issuer, upon the occurrence of specified events. In many cases, we may also seek to obtain registration rights in connection with these equity interests, which may include demand and &#8220;piggyback&#8221; registration rights, 

which grants us the right to register our equity interest when either the portfolio company or another investor in the portfolio company files a registration statement with the SEC to issue securities. We seek to dispose of these equity interests and realize gains upon our disposition of these interests. However, the equity interests we receive may not appreciate in value and, in fact, may decline in value. Accordingly, we may not be able to realize gains from our equity interests, and any gains that we do realize on the disposition of any equity interests may not be sufficient to offset any other losses we experience. 

We have invested and may continue to invest through joint ventures, partnerships and other special purpose vehicles and our investments through these vehicles may entail greater risks, or risks that we otherwise would not incur, if we otherwise made such investments directly. 

We may make indirect investments in portfolio companies through joint ventures, partnerships or other special purpose vehicles (&#8220;Investment Vehicles&#8221;). In general, the risks associated with indirect investments in portfolio companies through a joint venture, partnership or other special purpose vehicle are similar to those associated with a direct investment in a portfolio company; however, if we are not the sole investor in such Investment Vehicle, the investment may involve risks not present in investments where a third party is not involved. While we intend to analyze the credit and business of a potential portfolio company in determining whether to make an investment in an Investment Vehicle, we will nonetheless be exposed to the creditworthiness of the Investment Vehicle and any third party. In the event of a bankruptcy proceeding against the portfolio company, the assets of the portfolio company may be used to satisfy its obligations prior to the satisfaction of our investment in the Investment Vehicle (i.e., our investment in the Investment Vehicle could be structurally subordinated to the other obligations of the portfolio company). If a third party is involved, we are subject to the risk that such third-party could have financial difficulties resulting in a negative impact on the Investment Vehicle, could have economic or business interests or goals which are inconsistent with ours, or could be in a position to take (or block) action in a manner contrary to our investment objective or the increased possibility of default by, diminished liquidity or insolvency of, the third party, due to a sustained or general economic downturn. In addition, if we are not the sole investor in an Investment Vehicle, we may be required to rely on our partners in the Investment Vehicle when making decisions regarding such Investment Vehicle&#8217;s investments, accordingly, the value of the investment could be adversely affected if our interests diverge from those of our partners in the Investment Vehicle. 

Any strategic investments that we pursue are subject to risks and uncertainties. 

We have pursued and may continue to pursue growth through strategic investments in new businesses, including through investments in our specialty finance vehicles. Completion and timing of any such strategic investments may be subject to a number of contingencies, including the uncertainty in reaching a commercial agreement with our counterparty, our ability to obtain required board, shareholder and regulatory approvals, as well as any required financing (or the risk that these are obtained subject to terms and conditions that are not anticipated). We may not be required to announce an acquisition or strategic transaction until a definitive agreement is reached and the announcement or consummation of any such transaction may adversely impact our business relationships or engender competitive responses. 

In addition, the proposal and negotiation of strategic investments, whether or not completed, as well as the integration of those businesses into our existing portfolio, could result in substantial expenses and the diversion of our Adviser&#8217;s time, attention and resources from our day-to-day operations. 

Our ability to manage our growth through strategic investments will depend, in part, on our success in addressing these risks. Any failure to effectively implement our acquisition or strategic investment strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Broadly syndicated loans, including &#8220;covenant-lite&#8221; loans, may expose us to different risks, including with respect to liquidity, price volatility, ability to restructure loans, credit risks and less protective loan documentation, than is the case with loans that contain financial maintenance covenants. 

Our investments may consist of broadly syndicated loans that were not originated by us. Under the documentation for such loans, a financial institution or other entity typically is designated as the administrative agent and/or collateral agent. This agent is granted a lien on any collateral on behalf of the other lenders and distributes payments on the indebtedness as they are received. The agent is the party responsible for administering and enforcing the loan and generally may take actions only in accordance with the instructions of a majority or two-thirds in commitments and/or principal amount of the associated indebtedness. Accordingly, we may be precluded from directing such actions unless we or our investment adviser is the designated administrative agent or collateral agent or we act together with other holders of the indebtedness. If we are unable to direct such actions, we cannot assure shareholders that the actions taken will be in our best interests. 

There is also a risk that a loan agent may become bankrupt or insolvent. Such an event would delay, and possibly impair, any enforcement actions undertaken by holders of the associated indebtedness, including attempts to realize upon the collateral securing the associated indebtedness and/or direct the agent to take actions against the related obligor or the collateral securing the associated indebtedness and actions to realize on proceeds of payments made by obligors that are in the possession or control of any other financial institution. In addition, we may be unable to remove the agent in circumstances in which removal would be in our best interests. Moreover, agented loans typically allow for the agent to resign with certain advance notice. 

In addition, a significant number of high yield loans in the market, in particular the broadly syndicated loan market, may consist of &#8220;covenant-lite&#8221; loans. Generally, &#8220;covenant-lite&#8221; loans provide borrower companies more freedom to negatively impact lenders because their covenants are incurrence-based, which means they are only tested and can only be breached following an affirmative action of the borrower, rather than by a deterioration in the borrower&#8217;s financial condition. Ownership of &#8220;covenant-lite&#8221; 

loans may expose us to different risks, including with respect to liquidity, price volatility, ability to restructure loans, credit risks and less protective loan documentation, than is the case with loans that contain financial maintenance covenants. 

We may be subject to risks associated with our investments in bank loans. 

We may invest in bank loans and participations. These obligations are subject to unique risks, including: 

&#8226; the possible invalidation of an investment transaction as a fraudulent conveyance under relevant creditors&#8217; rights laws, 

&#8226; so-called lender-liability claims by the issuer of the obligations, 

&#8226; environmental liabilities that may arise with respect to collateral securing the obligations, and 

&#8226; limitations on our ability to directly enforce its rights with respect to participations. 

In addition, the illiquidity of bank loans may make it difficult for us to sell such investments to access capital if required. As a result, we could realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded our investments if we were required to sell them for liquidity purposes. Compared to securities and to certain other types of financial assets, purchases and sales of loans take relatively longer to settle. This extended settlement process can (i) increase the counterparty credit risk borne by us; (ii) leave us unable to timely vote, or otherwise act with respect to, loans it has agreed to purchase; (iii) delay us from realizing the proceeds of a sale of a loan; (iv) inhibit our ability to re-sell a loan that it has agreed to purchase if conditions change (leaving us more exposed to price fluctuations); (v) prevent us from timely collecting principal and interest payments; and (vi) expose us to adverse tax or regulatory consequences. To the extent the extended loan settlement process gives rise to short-term liquidity needs, we may hold cash, sell investments or temporarily borrow from banks or other lenders. 

In purchasing participations, we generally will have no right to enforce compliance by the borrower with the terms of the loan agreement, nor any rights of set-off against the borrower, and we may not directly benefit from the collateral supporting the debt obligation in which we have purchased the participation. As a result, we will assume the credit risk of both the borrower and the institution selling the participation. 

In analyzing each bank loan or participation, our Adviser compares the relative significance of the risks against the expected benefits of the investment. Successful claims by third parties arising from these and other risks will be borne by us. 

If the assets securing the loans that we make decrease in value, then we may lack sufficient collateral to cover losses. 

To attempt to mitigate credit risks, we intend to take a security interest in the available assets of our portfolio companies. There is no assurance that we will obtain sufficient collateral to cover losses or properly perfect our liens. 

There is a risk that the collateral securing our loans may decrease in value over time, may be difficult to sell in a timely manner, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based upon the success of the business and market conditions, including as a result of the inability of a portfolio company to raise additional capital. In some circumstances, our lien could be subordinated to claims of other creditors. Consequently, the fact that a loan is secured does not guarantee that we will receive principal and interest payments according to the loan&#8217;s terms, or that we will be able to collect on the loan should we be forced to enforce our remedies. 

We may suffer a loss if a portfolio company defaults on a loan and the underlying collateral is not sufficient. 

In the event of a default by a portfolio company on a secured loan, we will only have recourse to the assets collateralizing the loan. If the underlying collateral value is less than the loan amount, we will suffer a loss. In addition, we may make loans that are unsecured, which are subject to the risk that other lenders may be directly secured by the assets of the portfolio company. In the event of a default, those collateralized lenders would have priority over us with respect to the proceeds of a sale of the underlying assets. In cases described above, we may lack control over the underlying asset collateralizing our loan or the underlying assets of the portfolio company prior to a default, and as a result the value of the collateral may be reduced by acts or omissions by owners or managers of the assets. 

In the event of bankruptcy of a portfolio company, we may not have full recourse to its assets in order to satisfy our loan, or our loan may be subject to &#8220;equitable subordination.&#8221; This means that depending on the facts and circumstances, including the extent to which we actually provided significant &#8220;managerial assistance,&#8221; if any, to that portfolio company, a bankruptcy court might re-characterize our debt holding and subordinate all or a portion of our claim to that of other creditors. In addition, certain of our loans are subordinate to other debt of the portfolio company. If a portfolio company defaults on our loan or on debt senior to our loan, or in the event of a portfolio company bankruptcy, our loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt receives payment. Where debt senior to our loan exists, the presence of intercreditor arrangements may limit our ability to amend our loan documents, assign our loans, accept prepayments, exercise our remedies (through &#8220;standstill&#8221; periods) and control decisions made in bankruptcy proceedings relating to the portfolio company. Bankruptcy and portfolio company litigation can significantly increase collection losses and the time needed for us to acquire the underlying collateral in the event of a default, during which time the collateral may decline in value, causing us to suffer losses. 

Borrowers of broadly syndicated loans may be permitted to designate unrestricted subsidiaries under the terms of their financing agreements, which would exclude such unrestricted subsidiaries from restrictive covenants under the financing agreement with the borrower. Without restriction under the financing agreement, the borrower could take various actions with respect to the unrestricted subsidiary including, among other things, incur debt, grant security on its assets, sell assets, pay dividends or distribute 

shares of the unrestricted subsidiary to the borrower&#8217;s shareholders. Any of these actions could increase the amount of leverage that the borrower is able to incur and increase the risk involved in our investments in broadly syndicated loans accordingly. 

If the value of collateral underlying our loan declines or interest rates increase during the term of our loan, a portfolio company may not be able to obtain the necessary funds to repay our loan at maturity through refinancing. 

Decreasing collateral value and/or increasing interest rates may hinder a portfolio company&#8217;s ability to refinance our loan because the underlying collateral cannot satisfy the debt service coverage requirements necessary to obtain new financing. In some instances a borrower may engage in liability management exercises with certain of its investors who agree to provide additional capital or capital on modified terms in exchange for a superior position in the portfolio company&#8217;s capital structure. In such instances, the collateral securing our investment may be reduced or our lien may be further subordinated. If a borrower is unable to repay our loan at maturity, we could suffer a loss which may adversely impact our financial performance. 

We may not realize any income or gains from our equity investments. 

We have invested in and may continue to invest in equity-related securities, including common equity, warrants, preferred stock and convertible preferred securities. These equity interests we acquire may not appreciate in value and, in fact, may decline in value if the company fails to perform financially or achieve its growth objectives. We will generally have little, if any, control over the timing of any gains we may realize from our equity investments since these securities may have restrictions on their transfer or may not have an active trading market. 

Equity investments also have experienced significantly more volatility in their returns and may under-perform relative to fixed income securities during certain periods. An adverse event, such as an unfavorable earnings report, may depress the value. Also, prices of equity investments are sensitive to general movements in the stock market and a drop in the stock market may depress the price of common stock investments to which we have exposure. Equity prices fluctuate for several reasons including changes in investors' perceptions of the financial condition of an issuer or the general condition of the relevant stock market, or when political or economic events affecting the issuers occur. In addition, common stock prices may be particularly sensitive to rising interest rates, as the cost of capital rises and borrowing costs increase. 

Although we expect to receive current income in the form of dividend payments on any convertible preferred equity investments, a substantial portion of the gains we expect to receive from our investments in such securities will likely be from the capital gains generated from the sale of our equity investments upon conversion of our convertible securities, the timing of which we cannot predict and we cannot guarantee that such sale will happen at all. We do not expect to generate capital gains from the sale of our portfolio investments on a level or uniform basis from quarter to quarter. In addition, any convertible preferred stock instruments will generally provide for conversion upon the portfolio companies&#8217; achievement of certain milestone events, including a qualified public offering and/or a senior exchange listing for their common stock. However, there can be no assurance that our portfolio companies will obtain either a junior or senior exchange listing or, even if a listing is obtained, that an active trading market will ever develop in the common stock of our publicly traded portfolio companies. In addition, even if our portfolio companies obtain an exchange listing, we may be subject to lock-up provisions that prohibit us from selling our investments into the public market for specified periods of time after such listing. As a result, the market price of securities that we hold may decline substantially before we are able to sell these securities following an exchange listing. 

Accordingly, we may not be able to realize gains from our equity interests, and any gains that we do realize on the disposition of any equity interests may not be sufficient to offset any other losses we experience. Furthermore, due to the expected growth of our portfolio companies, we do not generally expect to receive dividend income from our common stock investments. In the case of cumulative preferred stock, there is no assurance that any dividends will ever be paid by a portfolio company. Dividends to any equity holders may be suspended or cancelled at any time. 

Investments in equity securities can carry additional risks and may have other characteristics that require investments to be made indirectly through blocker entities or otherwise. In addition, if an issuer of equity securities in which we have invested sells additional shares of its equity securities, our interest in the issuer may be diluted and the value of our investment could decrease. 

We may invest, to the extent permitted by law, in the equity securities of investment funds that are operating pursuant to certain exceptions to the 1940 Act and in advisers to similar investment funds and, to the extent we so invest, will bear our ratable share of any such company&#8217;s expenses, including management and performance fees. We will also remain obligated to pay the base management fee, income based fee and capital gains incentive fee to our investment adviser with respect to the assets invested in the securities and instruments of such companies. With respect to each of these investments, each of our common stockholders will bear his or her share of the base management fee, income based fee and capital gains incentive fee due to our investment adviser as well as indirectly bearing the management and performance fees and other expenses of any such investment funds or advisers. For the foregoing reasons, investments in equity securities can be highly speculative and carry a substantial risk of loss of investment. 

An investment strategy focused primarily on privately held companies presents certain challenges, including the lack of available information about these companies. 

We invest primarily in privately held companies. Investments in private companies pose certain incremental risks as compared to investments in public companies including that they: 

&#8226; have reduced access to the capital markets, resulting in diminished capital resources and ability to withstand financial distress; 

&#8226; may have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations under their debt obligations that we hold, which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of any collateral and a reduction in the likelihood of our realizing any guarantees we may have obtained in connection with our investment; 

&#8226; may have shorter operating histories, narrower product lines and smaller market shares than larger businesses, which tend to render them more vulnerable to competitors&#8217; actions and changing market conditions, as well as general economic downturns; 

&#8226; are more likely to depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of persons and, therefore, the death, disability, resignation or termination of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on the company and, in turn, on us; and 

&#8226; generally have less predictable operating results, may from time to time be parties to litigation, may be engaged in rapidly changing businesses with products subject to a substantial risk of obsolescence, and may require substantial additional capital to support their operations, finance expansion or maintain their competitive position. 

In addition, investments in private companies tend to be less liquid. The securities of private companies are not publicly traded or actively traded on the secondary market and are, instead, traded on a privately negotiated over-the-counter secondary market for institutional investors. These over-the-counter secondary markets may be inactive during an economic downturn or a credit crisis and in any event often have lower volumes than publicly traded securities even in normal market conditions. In addition, the securities in these companies will be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or will otherwise be less liquid than publicly traded securities. 

If there is no readily available market for these investments, we are required to carry these investments at fair value as determined by our Board. As a result, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we had previously recorded these investments. We may also face other restrictions on our ability to liquidate an investment in a portfolio company to the extent that we, our Adviser or any of its affiliates have material nonpublic information regarding such portfolio company or where the sale would be an impermissible joint transaction under the 1940 Act. The reduced liquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to dispose of them at a favorable price, and, as a result, we may suffer losses. 

Finally, little public information generally exists about private companies and these companies may not have third-party credit ratings or audited financial statements. We must therefore rely on the ability of our Adviser to obtain adequate information through due diligence to evaluate the creditworthiness and potential returns from investing in these companies, and to monitor the activities and performance of these investments. To the extent that we (or other clients of our Adviser) may hold a larger number of investments, greater demands will be placed on our Adviser&#8217;s time, resources and personnel in monitoring such investments, which may result in less attention being paid to any individual investment and greater risk that our investment decisions may not be fully informed. 

Additionally, these companies and their financial information will not generally be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other rules that govern public companies. If we are unable to uncover all material information about these companies, we may not make a fully informed investment decision, and we may lose money on our investments. 

To the extent we invest in publicly traded companies, we may be unable to obtain financial covenants and other contractual rights, which subjects us to additional risks. 

We have invested and may continue to invest in instruments issued by publicly-held companies, we may be subject to risks that differ in type or degree from those involved with investments in privately-held companies. Such risks include, without limitation, greater volatility in the valuation of such companies, increased obligations to disclose information regarding such companies, limitations on our ability to dispose of such instruments at certain times, increased likelihood of shareholder litigation against such companies&#8217; board members and increased costs associated with each of the aforementioned risks. In addition, to the extent we invest in publicly traded debt instruments, we may not be able to obtain financial covenants or other contractual rights that we might otherwise be able to obtain when making privately-negotiated investments. We may not have the same access to information in connection with investments in public debt instruments that we would expect to have in connection with privately-negotiated investments. If we or our Adviser were deemed to have material, nonpublic information regarding the issuer of a publicly traded instrument in which we have invested, we may be limited in our ability to make new investments or sell existing investments in such issue. 

The credit ratings of certain of our investments may not be indicative of the actual credit risk of such rated instruments. 

Rating agencies rate debt securities based upon their assessment of the likelihood of the receipt of principal and interest payments. Rating agencies do not consider the risks of fluctuations in market value or other factors that may influence the value of debt securities. Therefore, the credit rating assigned to a particular instrument may not fully reflect the true risks of an investment in such instrument. Credit rating agencies may change their methods of evaluating credit risk and determining ratings. These changes may occur quickly and often. While we may give some consideration to ratings, ratings may not be indicative of the actual credit risk of our investments in rated instruments. 

Prepayments of our debt investments by our portfolio companies could adversely impact our results of operations and reduce our return on equity. 

We are subject to the risk that the investments we make in our portfolio companies may be repaid prior to maturity. When this occurs, we will generally reinvest these proceeds in temporary investments, pending their future investment in new portfolio companies. These temporary investments will typically have substantially lower yields than the debt being prepaid and we could experience significant delays in reinvesting these amounts. 

Any future investment in a new portfolio company may also be at lower yields than the debt that was repaid. As a result, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if one or more of our portfolio companies elect to prepay amounts owed to us. Additionally, prepayments, net of prepayment fees, could negatively impact our return on equity. This risk will be more acute when interest rates decrease, as we may be unable to reinvest at rates as favorable as when we made our initial investment. 

A redemption of convertible securities held by us could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our investment objective. 

A convertible security may be subject to redemption at the option of the issuer at a price established in the convertible security&#8217;s governing instrument. If a convertible security held by us is called for redemption, we will be required to permit the issuer to redeem the security, convert it into the underlying common stock or sell it to a third party. Any of these actions could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our investment objective. 

To the extent original issue discount (&#8220;OID&#8221;) and payment-in-kind (&#8220;PIK&#8221;) interest income constitute a portion of our income, we will be exposed to risks associated with the deferred receipt of cash representing such income. 

Our investments may include OID and PIK instruments. To the extent OID and PIK constitute a portion of our income, we will be exposed to risks associated with such income being required to be included in income for financial reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;U.S. GAAP&#8221;) and taxable income prior to receipt of cash, including the following: 

&#8226; Original issue discount instruments may have unreliable valuations because the accruals require judgments about collectability or deferred payments and the value of any associated collateral; 

&#8226; Original issue discount instruments may create heightened credit risks because the inducement to the borrower to accept higher interest rates in exchange for the deferral of cash payments typically represents, to some extent, speculation on the part of the borrower; 

&#8226; For U.S. GAAP purposes, cash distributions to shareholders that include a component of OID income do not come from paid-in capital, although they may be paid from the offering proceeds. Thus, although a distribution of OID income may come from the cash invested by the shareholders, the 1940 Act does not require that shareholders be given notice of this fact; 

&#8226; The presence of OID and PIK creates the risk of non-refundable cash payments to our Adviser in the form of incentive fees on income based on non-cash OID and PIK accruals that may never be realized; and 

&#8226; In the case of PIK, &#8220;toggle&#8221; debt, which gives the issuer the option to defer an interest payment in exchange for an increased interest rate in the future, the PIK election has the simultaneous effect of increasing the investment income, thus increasing the potential for realizing incentive fees. 

Our portfolio companies may incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, our investments in such companies. 

Our strategy focuses on investing primarily in the debt of privately owned U.S. companies with a focus on originated transactions sourced through the networks of our Adviser. Our portfolio companies may have, or may be permitted to incur, other debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, the debt in which we invest. By their terms, such debt instruments may entitle the holders to receive payment of interest or principal on or before the dates on which we are entitled to receive payments with respect to the debt instruments in which we invest. Also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a portfolio company, any holders of debt instruments ranking senior to our investment in that portfolio company would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any distribution. After repaying such senior creditors, such portfolio company may not have any remaining assets to use for repaying its obligation to us. In the case of debt ranking equally with debt instruments in which we invest, we would have to share on an equal basis any distributions with other creditors holding such debt in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of the relevant portfolio company and our portfolio company may not have sufficient assets to pay all equally ranking credit even if we hold senior, first-lien debt. 

Our portfolio companies may be highly leveraged. 

Some of our portfolio companies may be highly leveraged, which may have adverse consequences to these companies and to us as an investor. These companies may be subject to restrictive financial and operating covenants and the leverage may impair these companies&#8217; ability to finance their future operations and capital needs. As a result, these companies&#8217; flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and to take advantage of business opportunities may be limited. Further, a leveraged company&#8217;s income and net assets will tend to increase or decrease at a greater rate than if borrowed money were not used. 

If we cannot obtain debt financing or equity capital on acceptable terms, our ability to acquire investments and to expand our operations will be adversely affected. 

Any working capital reserves we maintain may not be sufficient for investment purposes, and we may require additional debt financing or equity capital to operate. We generally are required to distribute at least 90% of our net ordinary income and net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses, if any, to our shareholders to maintain our tax treatment as a RIC. 

Accordingly, in the event that we need additional capital in the future for investments or for any other reason we may need to access the capital markets periodically to issue debt or equity securities or borrow from financial institutions in order to obtain such additional capital. These sources of funding may not be available to us due to unfavorable economic conditions, which could increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. Consequently, if we cannot obtain further debt or equity financing on acceptable terms, our ability to acquire additional investments and to expand our operations will be adversely affected. As a result, we would be less able to diversify our portfolio and achieve our investment objective, which may negatively impact our results of operations and reduce our ability to make distributions to our shareholders. See &#8220;&#8212; If we are unable to obtain additional debt financing, or if our borrowing capacity is materially reduced, our business could be materially adversely affected. &#8221; 

Defaults by our portfolio companies could jeopardize a portfolio company&#8217;s ability to meet its obligations under the debt or equity investments that we hold which could harm our operating results. 

A portfolio company&#8217;s failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by us or other lenders could lead to defaults and, potentially, termination of its debt financing and foreclosure on its secured assets, which could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements and jeopardize a portfolio company&#8217;s ability to meet its obligations under the debt or equity investments that we hold. We may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms, which may include the waiver of certain financial covenants, with a defaulting portfolio company. In addition, some of the loans in which we may invest may be &#8220;covenant-lite&#8221; loans. We use the term &#8220;covenant-lite&#8221; loans to refer generally to loans that do not have a complete set of financial maintenance covenants. Generally, &#8220;covenant-lite&#8221; loans provide borrower companies more freedom to negatively impact lenders because their covenants are incurrence-based, which means they are only tested and can only be breached following an affirmative action of the borrower, rather than by a deterioration in the borrower&#8217;s financial condition. Accordingly, to the extent we invest in &#8220;covenant-lite&#8221; loans, we may have fewer rights against a borrower and may have a greater risk of loss on such investments as compared to investments in or exposure to loans with financial maintenance covenants. 

As part of our lending activities, we may in certain opportunistic circumstances originate loans to companies that are experiencing significant financial or business difficulties, including companies involved in bankruptcy or other reorganization and liquidation proceedings. Any such investment would involve a substantial degree of risk. In any reorganization or liquidation proceeding relating to a company that we fund, we may lose all or part of the amounts advanced to the borrower or may be required to accept collateral with a value less than the amount of the loan advanced by us to the borrower. 

Subordinated liens on collateral securing debt investments that we may make to portfolio companies may be subject to control by senior creditors with first priority liens. If there is a default, the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to repay in full both the first priority creditors and us. 

Certain debt investments that we will make in portfolio companies will be secured on a second priority lien basis by the same collateral securing senior debt of such companies. We also make debt investments in portfolio companies secured on a first priority basis. The first priority liens on the collateral will secure the portfolio company&#8217;s obligations under any outstanding senior debt and may secure certain other future debt that may be permitted to be incurred by the portfolio company under the agreements governing the debt. In the event of a default, the holders of obligations secured by the first priority liens on the collateral will generally control the liquidation of and be entitled to receive proceeds from any realization of the collateral to repay their obligations in full before us. 

In addition, the value of the collateral in the event of liquidation will depend on market and economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. There can be no assurance that the proceeds, if any, from the sale or sales of all of the collateral would be sufficient to satisfy the debt obligations secured by the first priority or second priority liens after payment in full of all obligations secured by the first priority liens on the collateral. If such proceeds are not sufficient to repay amounts outstanding under the debt obligations secured by the first priority or second priority liens, then we, to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the collateral, will only have an unsecured claim against the portfolio company&#8217;s remaining assets, if any. 

We may also make unsecured debt investments in portfolio companies, meaning that such investments will not benefit from any interest in collateral of such companies. Liens on any such portfolio company&#8217;s collateral, if any, will secure the portfolio company&#8217;s obligations under its outstanding secured debt and may secure certain future debt that is permitted to be incurred by the portfolio company under its secured debt agreements. The holders of obligations secured by such liens will generally control the liquidation of, and be entitled to receive proceeds from, any realization of such collateral to repay their obligations in full before us. In addition, the value of such collateral in the event of liquidation will depend on market and economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. There can be no assurance that the proceeds, if any, from sales of such collateral would be sufficient to satisfy our unsecured debt obligations after payment in full of all secured debt obligations. If such proceeds were not sufficient to repay the outstanding secured debt obligations, then our unsecured claims would rank equally with the unpaid portion of such secured creditors&#8217; claims against the portfolio company&#8217;s remaining assets, if any. 

The rights we may have with respect to the collateral securing the debt investments we make in our portfolio companies with senior debt outstanding may also be limited pursuant to the terms of one or more inter-creditor agreements that we enter into with the holders of senior debt. Under such an inter-creditor agreement, at any time obligations that have the benefit of the first priority liens are outstanding, any of the following actions that may be taken in respect of the collateral will be at the direction of the holders of the obligations secured by the first priority liens: the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against the collateral; the ability to control the conduct of such proceedings; the approval of amendments to collateral documents; releases of liens on the collateral; and waivers of past defaults under collateral documents. We may not have the ability to control or direct such actions, even if our rights are adversely affected. 

Certain of our investments may be adversely affected by laws relating to fraudulent conveyance or voidable preferences. 

Certain of our investments could be subject to federal bankruptcy law and state fraudulent transfer laws, which vary from state to state, if the debt obligations relating to certain investments were issued with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or, in certain circumstances, if the issuer receives less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for issuing such debt obligations. If the debt proceeds are used for a buyout of shareholders, this risk is greater than if the debt proceeds are used for day-to-day operations or organic growth. If a court were to find that the issuance of the debt obligations was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, the court could void or otherwise refuse to recognize the payment obligations under the debt obligations or the collateral supporting such obligations, further subordinate the debt obligations or the liens supporting such obligations to other existing and future indebtedness of the issuer or require us to repay any amounts received by us with respect to the debt obligations or collateral. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, we may not receive any repayment on such debt obligations. 

Under certain circumstances, payments to us and distributions by us to our shareholders may be reclaimed if any such payment or distribution is later determined to have been a fraudulent conveyance, preferential payment or similar transaction under applicable bankruptcy and insolvency laws. Furthermore, investments in restructurings may be adversely affected by statutes relating to, among other things, fraudulent conveyances, voidable preferences, lender liability and the court&#8217;s discretionary power to disallow, subordinate or disenfranchise particular claims or re-characterize investments made in the form of debt as equity contributions. 

There may be circumstances where our debt investments could be subordinated to claims of other creditors or we could be subject to lender liability claims. 

Although we intend to structure certain of our investments as senior debt, if one of our portfolio companies were to go bankrupt, depending on the facts and circumstances, including the extent to which we provided managerial assistance to that portfolio company or a representative of us or our Adviser sat on the board of directors of such portfolio company, a bankruptcy court might re-characterize our debt investment and subordinate all or a portion of our claim to that of other creditors. In situations where a bankruptcy carries a high degree of political significance, our legal rights may be subordinated to other creditors. 

In addition, a number of U.S. judicial decisions have upheld judgments obtained by borrowers against lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories, collectively termed &#8220;lender liability.&#8221; Generally, lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has violated a duty (whether implied or contractual) of good faith, commercial reasonableness and fair dealing, or a similar duty owed to the borrower or has assumed an excessive degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or shareholders. Because of the nature of our investments in portfolio companies (including that, as a BDC, we may be required to provide managerial assistance to those portfolio companies if they so request upon our offer), we may be subject to allegations of lender liability. 

We generally will not control the business operations of our portfolio companies and, due to the illiquid nature of our holdings in our portfolio companies, we may not be able to dispose of our interests in our portfolio companies. 

We do not currently, and do not expect in the future to control most of our portfolio companies, although we may have board representation or board observation rights, and our debt agreements may impose certain restrictive covenants on our borrowers. As a result, we are subject to the risk that a portfolio company in which we invest may make business decisions with which we disagree and the management of such company, as representatives of the holders of their common equity, may take risks or otherwise act in ways that do not serve our interests as a debt investor. Due to the lack of liquidity for our investments in private companies, we may not be able to dispose of our interests in our portfolio companies as readily as we would like or at a favorable value. As a result, a portfolio company may make decisions that could decrease the value of our portfolio holdings. 

We and our portfolio companies are, and will continue to be, exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates. 

General interest rate fluctuations and changes in credit spreads on floating rate loans may have a substantial negative impact on our portfolio company investments and our investment opportunities and, accordingly, may have a material adverse effect on our rate of return on invested capital, our net investment income and our net asset value. The majority of our debt investments have, and are expected to have, variable interest rates that reset periodically based on benchmarks such as the SOFR, the SONIA, the Euro Interbank Offered Rate, the Federal Funds rate or Prime rate. Increases in interest rates have made and may continue to make it more difficult for our portfolio companies to service their obligations under the debt investments that we will hold and may increase defaults even where our investment income increases. Elevated interest rates could also cause borrowers to shift cash from other productive uses to the payment of interest, which may have a material adverse effect on their business and operations and could, over time, lead to increased defaults. Additionally, as interest rates have increased and the corresponding risk of default by borrowers has increased, the liquidity of higher interest rate loans may decrease as fewer investors may be willing to purchase such loans in the secondary market in light of the increased risk of a default by the borrower and the heightened risk of a loss of an investment in such loans. All of these risks may be exacerbated when interest rates rise rapidly and/or significantly. Decreases in credit spreads on debt that pays a floating rate of return would have an impact on the income generation of our floating rate assets. Trading prices for debt that pays a fixed rate of return tend to fall as interest rates rise. Trading prices tend to fluctuate more for fixed rate securities that have longer maturities. 

Conversely, if interest rates were to decline, borrowers may refinance their loans at lower interest rates, which could shorten the average life of the loans and reduce the associated returns on the investment, as well as require our Adviser and the Adviser&#8217;s personnel to incur management time and expense to re-deploy such proceeds, including on terms that may not be as favorable as our existing loans. 

In addition, because we borrow money to make investments, our net investment income will depend, in part, upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest those funds. As a result, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 

Portions of our investment portfolio and our borrowings have floating rate components. As a result, the recent significant changes in market interest rates have increased our interest expense as has the incurrence of additional fixed rate borrowings. In periods of elevated interest rates, such as in the current market, our cost of funds increases, which tends to reduce our net investment income. We may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as interest rate swap agreements, futures, options and forward contracts, subject to applicable legal requirements, including all necessary registrations (or exemptions from registration) with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. In addition, our interest expense may not decrease at the same rate as overall interest rates because of our fixed rate borrowings, which could lead to greater declines in our net investment income. These activities may limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the hedged borrowings. Adverse developments resulting from changes in interest rates or hedging transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We do not have a policy governing the maturities of our investments. This means that we are subject to greater risk (other things being equal) than a fund invested solely in shorter-term securities. A decline in the prices of the debt we own could adversely affect our net asset value. Also, an increase in interest rates available to investors could make an investment in our common stock less attractive if we are not able to increase our dividend rate. 

International investments create additional risks. 

We may make investments in portfolio companies that are domiciled outside of the United States. Our investments in foreign portfolio companies are deemed &#8220;non-qualifying assets,&#8221; which means that, as required by the 1940 Act, such investments, along with other investments in non-qualifying assets, may not constitute more than 30% of our total assets at the time of our acquisition of any such asset, after giving effect to the acquisition. Notwithstanding the limitation on our ownership of foreign portfolio companies, such investments subject us to many of the same risks as our domestic investments, as well as certain additional risks, including the following: 

&#8226; foreign governmental laws, rules and policies, including those relating to taxation and bankruptcy and restricting the ownership of assets in the foreign country or the repatriation of profits from the foreign country to the United States and any adverse changes in these laws; 

&#8226; foreign currency devaluations that reduce the value of and returns on our foreign investments; 

&#8226; adverse changes in the availability, cost and terms of investments due to the varying economic policies of a foreign country in which we invest; 

&#8226; adverse changes in tax rates, the tax treatment of transaction structures and other changes in operating expenses of a particular foreign country in which we invest; 

&#8226; the assessment of foreign-country taxes (including withholding taxes, transfer taxes and value added taxes, any or all of which could be significant) on income or gains from our investments in the foreign country; 

&#8226; changes that adversely affect the social, political and/or economic stability of a foreign country in which we invest;high inflation in the foreign countries in which we invest, which could increase the costs to us of investing in those countries; 

&#8226; deflationary periods in the foreign countries in which we invest, which could reduce demand for our assets in those countries and diminish the value of such investments and the related investment returns to us; and 

&#8226; legal and logistical barriers in the foreign countries in which we invest that materially and adversely limit our ability to enforce our contractual rights with respect to those investments. 

In addition, we may make investments in countries whose governments or economies may prove unstable. Certain of the countries in which we may invest may have political, economic and legal systems that are unpredictable, unreliable or otherwise inadequate with respect to the implementation, interpretation and enforcement of laws protecting asset ownership and economic interests. In some of the countries in which we may invest, there may be a risk of nationalization, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, which may have an adverse effect on our portfolio companies in those countries and the rates of return that we are able to achieve on such investments. We may also lose the total value of any investment which is nationalized, expropriated or confiscated. The financial results and investment opportunities available to us, particularly in developing countries and emerging markets, may be materially and adversely affected by any or all of these political, economic and legal risks. 

We expose ourselves to risks when we engage in risk management activities. 

We have entered, and may in the future enter, into hedging transactions, which may expose us to risks associated with such transactions. We may seek to utilize instruments such as forward contracts, currency options and interest rate swaps, caps, collars and floors to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates and market interest rates and the relative value of certain debt securities from changes in market interest rates. Use of these hedging instruments may include counter-party credit risk. The scope of risk management activities we undertake varies based on the level of interest rates, prevailing foreign currency exchange rates, the types of investments that are made and other changing market 

conditions. To the extent we have non-U.S. investments, particularly investments denominated in non-U.S. currencies, our hedging costs will increase. 

Hedging against a decline in the values of our portfolio positions would not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the values of such positions or prevent losses if the values of such positions were to decline. However, such hedging can establish other positions designed to gain from those same developments, thereby offsetting the decline in the value of such portfolio positions. Such hedging transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the values of the underlying portfolio positions were to increase. It also may not be possible to hedge against an exchange rate or interest rate fluctuation that is so generally anticipated that we are not able to enter into a hedging transaction at an acceptable price. 

The success of our hedging strategy will depend on our ability to correctly identify appropriate exposures for hedging. In connection with the September 2027 Notes, AUD 2027 Notes, January 2029 Notes, September 2029 Notes, March 2030 Notes and, March 2031 Notes which bear interest at fixed rates, we entered into interest rate swaps to continue to align the interest rates of our liabilities with our investment portfolio, which consists of predominately floating rate loans. However, unanticipated changes in currency exchange rates or other exposures that we might hedge may result in poorer overall investment performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions. In addition, the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in a hedging strategy and price movements in the portfolio positions being hedged may vary, as may the time period in which the hedge is effective relative to the time period of the related exposure. 

For a variety of reasons, we may not seek to (or be able to) establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the positions being hedged. Any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss. In addition, it may not be possible to hedge fully or perfectly against currency fluctuations affecting the value of securities denominated in non-U.S. currencies because the value of those securities is likely to fluctuate as a result of factors not related to currency fluctuations. Income derived from hedging transactions also is not eligible to be distributed to non-U.S. stockholders free from withholding taxes. Changes to the regulations applicable to the financial instruments we use to accomplish our hedging strategy could affect the effectiveness of that strategy. See &#8220;&#8212; The market structure applicable to derivatives imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (&#8220;CFTC&#8221;) and the SEC may affect our ability to use over-the-counter (&#8220;OTC&#8221;) derivatives for hedging purposes &#8221; and &#8220; We are, and will continue to be, exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates. &#8221; 

The market structure applicable to derivatives imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (&#8220;CFTC&#8221;) and the SEC may affect our ability to use over-the-counter (&#8220;OTC&#8221;) derivatives for hedging purposes. 

The Dodd-Frank Act and the CFTC enacted and the SEC has issued rules to implement broad new regulatory and structural requirements applicable to OTC derivatives markets and, to a lesser extent, listed commodity futures (and futures options) markets. Similar changes are in the process of being implemented in other major financial markets. 

The CFTC and the SEC have issued final rules establishing that certain swap transactions are subject to CFTC regulation. Engaging in such swap or other commodity interest transactions such as futures contracts or options on futures contracts may cause us to fall within the definition of &#8220;commodity pool&#8221; under the Commodity Exchange Act and related CFTC regulations. Our Adviser has claimed relief from CFTC registration and regulation as a commodity pool operator with respect to our operations, with the result that we are limited in our ability to use futures contracts or options on futures contracts or engage in swap transactions. Specifically, we are subject to strict limitations on using such derivatives other than for hedging purposes, whereby the use of derivatives not used solely for hedging purposes is generally limited to situations where (i) the aggregate initial margin and premiums required to establish such positions does not exceed five percent of the liquidation value of our portfolio, after taking into account unrealized profits and unrealized losses on any such contracts we have entered into; or (ii) the aggregate net notional value of such derivatives does not exceed 100% of the liquidation value of our portfolio. 

The Dodd-Frank Act also imposed requirements relating to real-time public and regulatory reporting of OTC derivative transactions, enhanced documentation requirements, position limits on an expanded array of derivatives, and recordkeeping requirements. Taken as a whole, these changes could significantly increase the cost of using uncleared OTC derivatives to hedge risks, including interest rate and foreign exchange risk; reduce the level of exposure we are able to obtain for risk management purposes through OTC derivatives (including as the result of the CFTC imposing position limits on additional products); reduce the amounts available to us to make non-derivatives investments; impair liquidity in certain OTC derivatives; and adversely affect the quality of execution pricing obtained by us, all of which could adversely impact our investment returns. 

In addition, as a result of rules adopted by U.S. and foreign regulators concerning certain financial contracts, including OTC derivatives, entered into with counterparties that have been designated as global systemically important banking organizations, we may be restricted in our ability to terminate such contracts following the occurrence of certain insolvency-related default events. Transactions with these counterparties, therefore, carry heighted risk in the event that the counterparty defaults on its obligations to us. 

Our ability to enter into transactions involving derivatives and financial commitment transactions may be limited. 

Rule 18f-4 requires a BDC (or a registered investment company) that uses derivatives to, among other things, comply with a value-at-risk leverage limit, adopt a derivatives risk management program and implement certain testing and board reporting requirements. Rule 18f-4 exempts BDCs that qualify as &#8220;limited derivatives users&#8221; from the aforementioned requirements, provided that these BDCs adopt written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to manage the BDC&#8217;s derivatives risks and comply with certain recordkeeping requirements. Under Rule 18f-4, a BDC may enter into an unfunded commitment agreement that is not a derivatives transaction, such as an agreement to provide financing to a portfolio company, if the BDC has, among other things, a reasonable belief, at the time it enters into such an agreement, that it will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet its 

obligations with respect to all of its unfunded commitment agreements, in each case as it becomes due. Collectively, these requirements may limit our ability to use derivatives and/or enter into certain other financial contracts. 

We may enter into total return swaps that would expose us to certain risks, including market risk, liquidity risk and other risks similar to those associated with the use of leverage. 

A total return swap is a contract in which one party agrees to make periodic payments to another party based on the change in the market value of the assets underlying the total return swap, which may include a specified security or loan, basket of securities or loans or securities or loan indices during the specified period, in return for periodic payments based on a fixed or variable interest rate. A total return swap is typically used to obtain exposure to a security, loan or market without owning or taking physical custody of such security or loan or investing directly in such market. A total return swap may effectively add leverage to our portfolio because, in addition to our total net assets, we would be subject to investment exposure on the amount of securities or loans subject to the total return swap. A total return swap is also subject to the risk that a counterparty will default on its payment obligations thereunder or that we will not be able to meet our obligations to the counterparty. In addition, because a total return swap is a form of synthetic leverage, such arrangements are subject to risks similar to those associated with the use of leverage. 

Our portfolio may be focused on a limited number of industries, which will subject us to a risk of significant loss if there is a downturn in a particular industry. 

Beyond the asset diversification requirements associated with our qualification as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we do not have fixed guidelines for diversification. While we are not targeting any specific industries, our investments may be focused on relatively few industries.To the extent that we hold large positions in a small number of issuers, or within a particular industry, our net asset value may be subject to greater fluctuation. We may also be more susceptible to any single economic or regulatory occurrence or a downturn in particular industry. As a result, the aggregate returns we realize may be significantly adversely affected if a small number of investments perform poorly or if we need to write down the value of any one investment. Additionally, a downturn in any particular industry in which we are invested could significantly affect our aggregate returns. Further, any industry in which we are meaningfully concentrated at any given time could be subject to significant risks that could adversely impact our aggregate returns. For example, as of December 31, 2024, our investments in internet software and services represented 11.6% of our portfolio at fair value. Our investments in internet software and services are subject to substantial risks, including, but not limited to, intense competition, changing technology, shifting user needs, frequent introductions of new products and services, competitors in different industries and ranging from large established companies to emerging startups, decreasing average selling prices of products and services resulting from rapid technological changes, cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents and various legal and regulatory risks. In addition, as of December 31, 2024, our investments in insurance represented 9.4% of our portfolio at fair value. The U.S. insurance industry is heavily regulated and our investments in insurance are subject to a variety of risks, including, but not limited to, additional or changing government regulations that could increase compliance and other costs of doing business, which may impact the business of such portfolio companies. 

We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain various required licenses in U.S. states or in any other jurisdiction where they may be required in the future. 

We are required to have and may be required in the future to obtain various state licenses to, among other things, originate commercial loans, and may be required to obtain similar licenses from other authorities, including outside of the United States, in the future in connection with one or more investments. Applying for and obtaining required licenses can be costly and take several months. We cannot assure you that we will maintain or obtain all of the licenses that we need on a timely basis. We also are and will be subject to various information and other requirements to maintain and obtain these licenses, and we cannot assure you that we will satisfy those requirements. Our failure to maintain or obtain licenses that we require, now or in the future, might restrict investment options and have other adverse consequences. 

Certain investment analyses and decisions by our Adviser may be required to be undertaken on an expedited basis. 

Investment analyses and decisions by our Adviser may be required to be undertaken on an expedited basis to take advantage of certain investment opportunities. While we generally will not seek to make an investment until our Adviser has conducted sufficient due diligence to make a determination as to the acceptability of the credit quality of the investment and the underlying issuer, in such cases, the information available to our Adviser at the time of making an investment decision may be limited. Therefore, no assurance can be given that our Adviser will have knowledge of all circumstances that may adversely affect an investment. In addition, our Adviser may rely upon independent consultants and others in connection with its evaluation of proposed investments. No assurance can be given as to the accuracy or completeness of the information provided by such independent consultants and we may incur liability as a result of such consultants&#8217; actions, many of whom we will have limited recourse against in the event of any such inaccuracies. 

We may not have the funds or ability to make additional investments in our portfolio companies. 

After our initial investment in a portfolio company, we may be called upon from time to time to provide additional funds to such company or have the opportunity to increase our investment through the exercise of a warrant or other right to purchase common stock. There is no assurance that we will make, or will have sufficient funds to make, follow-on investments. Even if we do have sufficient capital to make a desired follow-on investment, we may elect not to make a follow-on investment because we may not want to increase our level of risk, we prefer other opportunities, we are limited in our ability to do so by compliance with BDC requirements, or in order to maintain our RIC status. Our ability to make follow-on investments may also be limited by our Adviser&#8217;s allocation policies. Any decision not to make a follow-on investment or any inability on our part to make such an investment may 

have a negative impact on a portfolio company in need of such an investment, may result in a missed opportunity for us to increase our participation in a successful investment or may reduce the expected return to us on the investment. 

We are subject to certain risks as a result of our interests in the CLO Preferred Shares. 

Under the terms of the loan sale agreements entered into in connection with our debt securitization transactions with respect to the CLOs (collectively, the &#8220;CLO Transactions&#8221;), we and certain financing subsidiaries sold and/or contributed to the respective issuers in connection with the particular CLO Transaction (the ""CLO Issuers""), all of the ownership interest in the portfolio loans and participations held by the CLO Issuers on the closing date for the CLO Transaction for the purchase price and other consideration set forth in such loan sale agreements. As a result of the CLO Transactions, we hold all of the preferred shares issued by the CLO Issuers (collectively, the &#8220;CLO Preferred Shares&#8221;), which comprise 100% of the equity interests (other than, in the case of CLO Issuers domiciled in the Cayman Islands, certain nominal interests held by a charitable trust for purposes of limiting the ability of the CLO Issuers to file for bankruptcy) in the CLO Issuers and in the case of CLO Transactions which have a Delaware limited liability company as co-issuer (the &#8220;CLO Co-Issuers&#8221;), such CLO Issuer in turn owns 100% of the equity of such CLO Co-Issuer. In the case of CLO Issuers organized in Delaware, we own the equity interests of such CLO Issuer (i.e., the CLO Preferred Shares). As a result, we expect to consolidate the financial statements of the CLO Issuers in our consolidated financial statements. However, once sold or contributed to a CLO, the underlying loans and participation interests have been securitized and are no longer our direct investment, and the risk return profile has been altered. In general, rather than holding interests in the underlying loans and participation interests, the CLO Transactions resulted in us holding equity interests in the CLO Issuers, with the CLO Issuers holding the underlying loans. As a result, we are subject both to the risks and benefits associated with the Preferred Shares and, indirectly, the risks and benefits associated with the underlying loans and participation interests held by the CLO Issuers. In addition, our ability to sell, amend or otherwise modify an underlying loan held by a CLO Issuer is subject to certain conditions and restrictions under the applicable CLO Transactions, which may prevent us from taking actions that we would take if we held such underlying loan directly. 

The subordination of the CLO Preferred Shares will affect our right to payment . 

The respective CLO Preferred Shares are subordinated to the notes issued and amounts borrowed by the CLO Issuers and CLO Co-Issuers, as applicable (collectively, the &#8220;CLO Debt&#8221;), respectively, and certain fees and expenses. If an overcollateralization test or an interest coverage test is not satisfied as of a determination date, the proceeds from the underlying loans otherwise payable to a CLO Issuer (which such CLO Issuer could have distributed with respect to the CLO Preferred Shares of such CLO Issuer) will be diverted to the payment of principal on the CLO Debt of such CLO Issuer. See &#8220;&#8212;The CLO Indentures require mandatory redemption of the respective CLO Debt for failure to satisfy coverage tests, which would reduce the amounts available for distribution to us.&#8221; 

On the scheduled maturity of the CLO Debt of a CLO Issuer or if such CLO Debt is accelerated after an event of default, proceeds available after the payment of certain administrative expenses will be applied to pay both principal of and interest on the such CLO Debt until such CLO Debt is paid in full before any further payment will be made on the CLO Preferred Shares of such CLO Issuer. As a result, such CLO Preferred Shares would not receive any payments until such CLO Debt is paid in full and under certain circumstances may not receive payments at any time. 

In addition, if an event of default occurs and is continuing with respect to the CLO Debt of a CLO Issuer, the holders of such CLO Debt will be entitled to determine the remedies to be exercised under the indenture pursuant to which such CLO Debt was issued (each a &#8220;CLO Indenture&#8221; and collectively, the &#8220;CLO Indentures&#8221;). Remedies pursued by the holders of CLO Debt could be adverse to our interests as the holder of CLO Preferred Shares, and the holders of CLO Debt will have no obligation to consider any possible adverse effect on such our interest or the interest of any other person. See &#8220;&#8201;&#8212; The holders of certain CLO Debt will control many rights under the CLO Indentures and therefore, we will have limited rights in connection with an event of default or distributions thereunder. &#8221; 

The CLO Preferred Shares represent leveraged investments in the underlying loan portfolio of the applicable CLO Issuer, which is a speculative investment technique that increases the risk to us as the owner of the CLO Preferred Shares. As the junior interest in a leveraged capital structure, the CLO Preferred Shares will bear the primary risk of deterioration in the performance of the applicable CLO Issuer and its portfolio of underlying loans. 

The holders of certain CLO Debt will control many rights under the CLO Indentures and therefore, we will have limited rights in connection with an event of default or distributions thereunder. 

Under each CLO Indenture, as long as any CLO Debt of the applicable CLO Issuer is outstanding, the holders of the senior-most outstanding class of such CLO Debt will have the right to direct the trustee or the applicable CLO Issuer to take certain actions under the applicable CLO Indenture or any related credit agreement. For example, these holders will have the right, following an event of default, to direct certain actions and control certain decisions, including the right to accelerate the maturity of applicable CLO Debt and, under certain circumstances, the liquidation of the collateral. Remedies pursued by such holders upon an event of default could be adverse to our interests. 

Although we, as the holder of the CLO Preferred Shares, will have the right, subject to the conditions set forth in the CLO Indentures, to purchase assets in any liquidation of assets by the collateral trustee, if an event of default has occurred and is continuing, we will not have any creditors&#8217; rights against the applicable CLO Issuer and will not have the right to determine the remedies to be exercised under the applicable CLO Indenture. There is no guarantee that any funds will remain to make distributions to us as the holder of the CLO Preferred Shares following any liquidation of assets and the application of the proceeds from such assets to pay the applicable CLO Debt and the fees, expenses, and other liabilities payable by the applicable CLO Issuer. 

The CLO Indentures require mandatory redemption of the respective CLO Debt for failure to satisfy coverage tests, which would reduce the amounts available for distribution to us. 

Under the CLO Indentures governing the CLO Transactions, there are two coverage tests applicable to CLO Debt. These tests apply to each CLO Transaction separately. The first such test, the interest coverage test, compares the amount of interest proceeds received and, other than in the case of defaulted loans, scheduled to be received on the underlying loans held by each CLO Issuer to the amount of interest due and payable on the CLO Debt of such CLO Issuer and the amount of fees and expenses senior to the payment of such interest in the priority of distribution of interest proceeds. To satisfy this test interest received on the portfolio loans held by such CLO Issuer must meet a minimum percentage under the applicable CLO Indenture for the respective class or classes of the amount equal to the interest payable on the CLO Debt of such CLO Issuer for such class or classes, plus the senior fees and expenses. 

The second such test, the overcollateralization test, compares the adjusted collateral principal amount of the portfolio of underlying loans of each CLO Issuer to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the CLO Debt of such CLO Issuer. To satisfy this second test at any time, this adjusted collateral principal amount must meet a minimum percentage under the applicable CLO Indenture for the respective class or classes. In this test, certain reductions are applied to the principal balance of underlying loans in connection with certain events, such as defaults or ratings downgrades to &#8220;CCC&#8221; levels or below with respect to the loans held by each CLO Issuer. These adjustments increase the likelihood that this test is not satisfied. 

If either coverage test with respect to a CLO Transaction is not satisfied on any determination date on which such test is applicable, the applicable CLO Issuer must apply available amounts to redeem its CLO Debt in an amount necessary to cause such test to be satisfied. This would reduce or eliminate the amounts otherwise available to make distributions to us as the holder of the CLO Preferred Shares of such CLO Issuer. 

Our investments in portfolio companies may expose us to environmental risks. 

We may invest in portfolio companies that are subject to changing and increasingly stringent environmental and health and safety laws, regulations and permit requirements and environmental costs that could place increasing financial burdens on such portfolio entities. Required expenditures for environmental compliance may adversely impact investment returns on portfolio companies. The imposition of new environmental and other laws, regulations and initiatives could adversely affect the business operations and financial stability of such portfolio companies. 

There can be no guarantee that all costs and risks regarding compliance with environmental laws and regulations can be identified. New and more stringent environmental and health and safety laws, regulations and permit requirements or stricter interpretations of current laws or regulations could impose substantial additional costs on our portfolio companies. Compliance with such current or future environmental requirements does not ensure that the operations of the portfolio companies will not cause injury to the environment or to people under all circumstances or that the portfolio companies will not be required to incur additional unforeseen environmental expenditures. Moreover, failure to comply with any such requirements could have a material adverse effect on a portfolio company, and we can offer no assurance that any such portfolio companies will at all times comply with all applicable environmental laws, regulations and permit requirements. 

Climate change and climate-related effects may expose us to systemic, global, macroeconomic risks and could adversely affect our business and the businesses of our products&#8217; portfolio companies. 

Global climate change is widely considered to be a significant threat to the global economy. We and the companies in which we invest may face risks associated with climate change, including physical risks such as an increased frequency or severity of extreme weather events and rising sea levels and temperatures. In addition, climate change may also impact our profitability and costs, as well as pose systemic risks for our businesses and those of the companies in which we invest. For example, to the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, energy use by us or the companies in which we invest could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of any changes. Increases in the cost of energy could adversely affect the cost of operations of us or the companies in which we invest. On the other hand, a decrease in energy use due to weather changes may affect the financial condition of some of the companies in which we invest through decreased revenues. Additionally, extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, including costs of insurance (particularly for real estate in certain regions), and can contribute to increased system stresses, including service interruptions. 

The United States is currently a party to the Paris Agreement, which includes commitments from countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, among other commitments. While the new U.S. Presidential administration recently announced the United States&#8217; withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, the withdrawal is not expected to go into affect until early 2026. In addition, various other regulatory and voluntary initiatives launched by international, federal, state, and regional policymakers and regulatory authorities as well as private actors seeking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may expose our business operations, products and products&#8217; portfolio companies to other types of transition risks, such as: (i) political and policy risks, (including changing regulatory incentives, and legal requirements, including with respect to greenhouse gas emissions, that could result in increased costs or changes in business operations), (ii) regulatory and litigation risks, (including changing legal requirements that could result in increased permitting, tax and compliance costs, enhanced disclosure obligations, changes in business operations, or the discontinuance of certain operations, and litigation seeking monetary or injunctive relief related to impacts related to climate change), (iii) technology and market risks, (including declining market for investments in industries seen as greenhouse gas intensive or less effective than alternatives in reducing greenhouse gas emissions), (iv) business trend risks, (including requirements for certain portfolio companies related to capital expenditures, product or service redesigns, and changes to operations and supply chains to meet changing customer expectations, and the increased attention to ESG considerations by our investors, including in connection with their determination of 

whether to invest), and (v) potential harm to our reputation if our shareholders believe that we are not adequately or appropriately responding to climate change and/or climate risk management, including through the way in which we operate our business, the composition of portfolio, our new investments or the decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to climate change considerations. 

Risks Related to an Investment in Our Common Stock 

Investors will not know the purchase price per share at the time they submit their subscription agreements and could receive fewer shares of our common stock than anticipated if our Board determines to increase the offering price to a price that we believe reflects the net asset value per share of the Class S, Class D and Class I shares in accordance with our share pricing policy. 

The Class S, Class D and Class I shares may, to the extent permitted or required under the rules and regulations of the SEC, be sold at prices necessary to ensure that shares are not sold at prices per share, after deducting the applicable Upfront Sales Load, that are below our net asset value per share for such class, if our net asset value per share: (i) declines more than 10% from the net asset value per share as of the effective date of this registration statement or (ii) increases to an amount that is greater than the net proceeds per share as stated herein. 

In accordance with the Company&#8217;s share pricing policy, we will modify our public offering price to the extent necessary to comply with the requirements of the 1940 Act, including the requirement that we not sell our shares at a net offering price below our net asset value per share unless we obtain the requisite approval from our shareholders. 

As a result, your purchase price may be higher than the prior subscription closing price per share, and therefore you may receive a smaller number of shares than if you had subscribed at the prior subscription closing price. 

If we are unable to raise substantial funds in our ongoing, continuous &#8220;best efforts&#8221; offering, we may be limited in the number and type of investments we may make, and the value of your investment in us may be reduced in the event our assets under- perform. 

Our continuous offering is being made on a best efforts basis, whereby our Dealer Manager and participating broker-dealers are only required to use their best efforts to sell our shares and have no firm commitment or obligation to purchase any of our shares. To the extent that less than the maximum number of shares is subscribed for, the opportunity for diversification of our investments may be decreased and the returns achieved on those investments may be reduced as a result of allocating all of our expenses among a smaller capital base. 

Our shares are not listed, and we do not intend to list our shares, on an exchange, nor are our shares quoted through a quotation system. Therefore, our shareholders will have limited liquidity and may not receive a full return of invested capital (including front-end commissions, fees and expenses), upon selling their shares or upon liquidation of our company. 

Our shares are illiquid investments for which there is not a secondary market nor is it expected that any such secondary market will develop in the future. We do not intend to complete a liquidity event within any specific time period, if at all. A liquidity event could include a merger or another transaction approved by our Board in which our shareholders will receive cash or shares of a listed company, or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets either on a complete portfolio basis or individually followed by a liquidation. We do not intend to list our shares on a national securities exchange. Upon the occurrence of a liquidity event, if any, all Class S and Class D shares will automatically convert into Class I shares and the ongoing servicing fee will terminate. 

Our Dealer Manager in our continuous offering may be unable to sell a sufficient number of shares of common stock for us to achieve our investment objective. Our ability to conduct our continuous offering successfully is dependent, in part, on the ability of our Dealer Manager to successfully establish, operate and maintain relationships with a network of broker-dealers. 

The success of our continuous public offering, and correspondingly our ability to implement our business strategy, is dependent upon the ability of our Dealer Manager to establish and maintain relationships with a network of licensed securities broker-dealers and other agents to sell our shares. If our Dealer Manager fails to perform, we may not be able to raise adequate proceeds through our public offering to implement our investment strategy. If we are unsuccessful in implementing our investment strategy, you could lose all or a part of your investment. 

Purchases of shares of our common stock by persons affiliated with us or our Adviser should not influence investment decisions of independent, unaffiliated investors. 

Except for certain share ownership and transfer restrictions contained in our charter, there is no limit on the number of shares that may be sold to our officers, directors, and Adviser, its affiliates and/or immediate family members. There is no assurance, however, that we will be successful in raising additional funds in our offering. If we are unsuccessful in raising additional funds, we may be unable to diversify our portfolio, and our operating expenses as a percentage of our gross offering proceeds will be higher. 

We may be unable to invest a significant portion of the net proceeds of our offering on acceptable terms in an acceptable timeframe. 

Delays in investing the net proceeds of our offering may impair our performance. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to identify investments that meet our investment objective or that any investment that we make will produce a positive return. We may be unable to invest the net proceeds of our offering on acceptable terms within the time period that we anticipate or at all, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. 

Before making investments, we will invest the net proceeds of our continuous public offering primarily in cash, cash-equivalents, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements, and/or other high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. This will produce returns that are significantly lower than the returns which we expect to achieve when our portfolio is fully invested in securities and loans meeting our investment objective. As a result, any distributions that we pay while our portfolio is not fully invested may be lower than the distributions that we may be able to pay when our portfolio is fully invested in securities meeting our investment objective. 

We intend, but are not required, to offer to repurchase shareholders&#8217; shares on a quarterly basis. As a result, shareholders will have limited opportunities to sell their shares. 

In the third quarter of 2017, we began offering, and on a quarterly basis, intend to continue offering, to repurchase shares of our common stock on such terms as may be determined by our Board in its complete discretion. Our Board has complete discretion to determine whether we will engage in any share repurchase, and if so, the terms of such repurchase. At the discretion of our Board, we may use cash on hand, cash available from borrowings, and cash from the sale of our investments as of the end of the applicable period to repurchase shares. We have not established limits on the amount of funds we may use from any available sources to repurchase shares; however, we will not borrow funds for the purpose of repurchasing shares if the amount of such repurchases would exceed our accrued and received Net Revenues for the previous four quarters. Economic events affecting the U.S. economy, such as volatility in the financial markets, inflation, higher interest rates or global or national events that are beyond our control, could cause an increased number of shares to be put to us for repurchase. To the extent that the number of shares put to us for repurchase exceeds the number of shares that we are able to purchase, we will repurchase shares on a pro rata basis, not on a first-come, first-serve basis. Further, we will have no obligation to repurchase shares if the repurchase would violate the restrictions on distributions under federal law or Maryland law. These limits may prevent us from accommodating all repurchase requests made in any quarter. 

All shares purchased by us pursuant to the terms of each offer to repurchase will be retired and thereafter will be authorized and unissued shares. 

Any periodic repurchase offers are subject in part to our available cash and compliance with the BDC and RIC qualification and diversification rules promulgated under the 1940 Act and the Code, respectively. While we intend to continue to conduct quarterly tender offers as described above, we are not required to do so and may suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time. 

The timing of our repurchase offers pursuant to our share repurchase program may be at a time that is disadvantageous to our shareholders, and, to the extent shareholders are able to sell their shares under the program, they may not be able to recover the amount of their investment in our shares. 

When we make repurchase offers pursuant to the share repurchase program, we may offer to repurchase shares at a price that is lower than the price that shareholders paid for our shares. As a result, to the extent shareholders paid a price that includes the related sales load and to the extent shareholders have the ability to sell their shares pursuant to our share repurchase program, the price at which they may sell shares, which will be the current net offering price per share in effect on each date of repurchase, may be lower than the amount they paid in connection with the purchase of shares in this offering. 

A shareholder&#8217;s interest in us will be diluted if we issue additional shares, which could reduce the overall value of an investment in us. 

Our shareholders do not have preemptive rights to purchase any shares we issue in the future. Our charter authorizes us to issue up to 4.5 billion shares of common stock. Pursuant to our charter, a majority of our entire Board may amend our charter to increase the number of shares of common stock we may issue without shareholder approval. Our Board may elect to sell additional shares in the future or issue equity interests in private offerings. To the extent we issue additional equity interests at or below net asset value, your percentage ownership interest in us may be diluted. In addition, depending upon the terms and pricing of any additional offerings and the value of our investments, you may also experience dilution in the book value and fair value of your shares. 

Under the 1940 Act, we generally are prohibited from issuing or selling our common stock at a price below net asset value per share, which may be a disadvantage as compared with certain public companies. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options, or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the current net asset value of our common stock if our Board and independent directors determine that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our shareholders, and our shareholders, including a majority of those shareholders that are not affiliated with us, approve such sale. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold may not be less than a price that, in the determination of our Board, closely approximates the fair value of such securities (less any distributing commission or discount). If we raise additional funds by issuing common stock or senior securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, our common stock, then the percentage ownership of our shareholders at that time will decrease and you will experience dilution. 

Certain provisions of our charter and actions of our Board could deter takeover attempts and have an adverse impact on the value of shares of our common stock. 

Our charter, as well as certain statutory and regulatory requirements, contain certain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire us. Our Board is divided into three classes of directors serving staggered three-year terms, which could prevent shareholders from removing a majority of directors in any given election. Our Board may, without shareholder action, authorize the issuance of shares in one or more classes or series, including shares of preferred stock; and our Board may, without shareholder action, amend our charter to increase the number of shares of our common stock, of any class or series, that 

we will have authority to issue. These anti-takeover provisions may inhibit a change of control in circumstances that could give the holders of shares of our common stock the opportunity to realize a premium over the value of shares of our common stock. 

Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. 

The investments we make in accordance with our investment objective may result in a higher amount of risk than alternative investment options, including volatility or loss of principal. Our investments in portfolio companies may be highly speculative and aggressive and, therefore, an investment in our common stock may not be suitable for someone with lower risk tolerance. 

The value of our common stock may fluctuate significantly. 

The value and liquidity, if any, of the market for shares of our common stock may be significantly affected by numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be directly related to our operating performance. These factors include: 

&#8226; changes in the value of our portfolio of investments and derivative instruments as a result of changes in market factors, such as interest rate shifts, and also portfolio specific performance, such as portfolio company defaults, among other reasons; 

&#8226; changes in regulatory policies or tax guidelines, particularly with respect to RICs or BDCs; 

&#8226; loss of RIC tax treatment or BDC status; 

&#8226; distributions that exceed our net investment income and net income as reported according to U.S. GAAP; 

&#9702; changes in earnings or variations in operating results; 

&#8226; changes in accounting guidelines governing valuation of our investments; 

&#8226; any shortfall in revenue or net income or any increase in losses from levels expected by investors; 

&#8226; departure of our Adviser or certain of its key personnel; 

&#8226; general economic trends and other external factors; and 

&#8226; loss of a major funding source 

We may experience fluctuations in our quarterly results. 

We could experience fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to a number of factors, including our ability or inability to make investments in companies that meet our investment criteria, the interest rate payable on the loans or other debt securities we originate or acquire, the level of our expenses (including our borrowing costs), variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses, the degree to which we encounter competition in our markets and general economic conditions. As a result of these factors, results for any previous period should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future periods or the full fiscal year. 

The amount of any distributions we may make on our common stock is uncertain. We may not be able to pay distributions to shareholders, or be able to sustain distributions at any particular level, and our distributions per share, if any, may not grow over time, and our distributions per share may be reduced. We have not established any limits on the extent to which we may use borrowings, if any, and we may use sources other than cash flows from operations to fund distributions (which may reduce the amount of capital we ultimately invest in portfolio companies). 

Subject to our Board&#8217;s discretion and applicable legal restrictions, we intend to authorize and declare cash distributions on a monthly or quarterly basis and pay such distributions on a monthly basis. We expect to pay distributions out of assets legally available for distribution. However, we cannot assure you that we will achieve investment results that will allow us to make a consistent targeted level of cash distributions or year-to-year increases in cash distributions. Our ability to pay distributions might be adversely affected by the impact of the risks described herein. Further, the per share amount of distributions on Class S, Class D and Class I shares may differ because of different allocations of class-specific expenses. For example, distributions on Class S and Class D shares will be lower than on Class I shares because Class S and Class D shares are subject to different ongoing servicing fees. In addition, the inability to satisfy the asset coverage test applicable to us as a BDC under the 1940 Act can limit our ability to pay distributions. Distributions from sources other than cash flows also could reduce the amount of capital we ultimately invest in debt or equity securities of portfolio companies. Further, the per share amount of distributions on Class S, Class D and Class I shares may differ because of different allocations of class-specific expenses. For example, distributions on Class S and Class D shares will be lower than on Class I shares because Class S and Class D shares are subject to different ongoing servicing fees. We cannot assure you that we will pay distributions to our shareholders in the future. 

Distributions on our common stock may exceed our taxable earnings and profits. Therefore, portions of the distributions that we pay may represent a return of capital to you. A return of capital is a return of a portion of your original investment in shares of our common stock. As a result, a return of capital will (i) lower your tax basis in your shares and thereby increase the amount of capital gain (or decrease the amount of capital loss) realized upon a subsequent sale or redemption of such shares, and (ii) reduce the amount of funds we have for investment in portfolio companies. We have not established any limit on the extent to which we may use offering proceeds to fund distributions. 

We may pay our distributions from offering proceeds in anticipation of future cash flow, which may constitute a return of your capital and will lower your tax basis in your shares, thereby increasing the amount of capital gain (or decreasing the amount of 

capital loss) realized upon a subsequent sale or redemption of such shares, even if such shares have not increased in value or have, in fact, lost value. Distributions from offering proceeds also could reduce the amount of capital we ultimately have available to invest in portfolio companies. 

Our stockholders could receive shares of our common stock as dividends, which could result in adverse tax consequences to them. 

Although we currently do not intend to do so, we are permitted to declare a large portion of a dividend in shares of common stock instead of cash at the election of each stockholder. Revenue Procedures issued by the IRS allow a publicly offered RIC to distribute its own stock as a dividend for the purpose of fulfilling its distribution requirements, if certain conditions are satisfied. Among other things, the aggregate amount of cash available to be distributed to all stockholders is required to be at least 20% of the aggregate declared distribution. The Internal Revenue Service has also issued private letter rulings on cash/stock dividends paid by RICs and real estate investment trusts where the cash component is limited to 20% of the total distribution if certain requirements are satisfied. Stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend (including the portion payable in stock) as ordinary income (or, in certain circumstances, long-term capital gain) to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes. As a result, stockholders could be required to pay income taxes with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividends received. It is unclear to what extent we will be able to pay taxable dividends in cash and common stock (whether pursuant to IRS Revenue Procedures, a private letter ruling or otherwise). 

Our distributions to shareholders may be funded from expense reimbursements or waivers of investment advisory fees that are subject to repayment pursuant to our Expense Support Agreement. 

Prior to its termination, substantial portions of our distributions were funded through the reimbursement of certain expenses by our Adviser and its affiliates, including through the waiver of certain investment advisory fees by our Adviser, that are subject to repayment by us within three years. Any such distributions funded through expense reimbursements or waivers of advisory fees will not be based on our investment performance, and can only be sustained if we achieve positive investment performance in future periods and/or our Adviser and its affiliates continue to make such reimbursements or waivers of such fees. Our future repayments of amounts reimbursed or waived by our Adviser or its affiliates will reduce the distributions that shareholders would otherwise receive in the future. There can be no assurance that we will achieve the performance necessary to be able to pay distributions at a specific rate or at all. Our Adviser and its affiliates have no obligation to waive advisory fees or otherwise reimburse expenses in future periods. 

Shareholders will experience dilution in their ownership percentage if they do not participate in our distribution reinvestment plan. 

We have a adopted a distribution reinvestment plan, pursuant to which we will reinvest all cash distributions declared by the Board on behalf of our shareholders who elect to participate, or &#8220;opt-in,&#8221; in shares of our common stock. As a result, shareholders that do not elect to participate in our distribution reinvestment plan will experience dilution over time. Shareholders who do not elect to participate in our distribution reinvestment plan may experience accretion to the net asset value of their shares if our shares are trading at a premium to net asset value and dilution if our shares are trading at a discount to net asset value. The level of accretion or discount would depend on various factors, including the proportion of our shareholders who participate in the plan, the level of premium or discount at which our shares are trading and the amount of the distribution payable to shareholders. 

Preferred stock could be issued with rights and preferences that would adversely affect holders of our common stock. 

Under the terms of our charter, our Board is authorized to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without shareholder approval, which could potentially adversely affect the interests of existing shareholders. In particular, holders of preferred stock are required to have certain voting rights when there are unpaid dividends and priority over other classes of securities as to distribution of assets or payment of dividends. 

If we issue preferred stock or convertible debt securities, the net asset value of our common stock may become more volatile. 

We cannot assure you that the issuance of preferred stock and/or convertible debt securities would result in a higher yield or return to the holders of our common stock. The issuance of preferred stock or convertible debt would likely cause the net asset value of our common stock to become more volatile. If the dividend rate on the preferred stock, or the interest rate on the convertible debt securities, were to approach the net rate of return on our investment portfolio, the benefit of such leverage to the holders of our common stock would be reduced. If the dividend rate on the preferred stock, or the interest rate on the debt securities, were to exceed the net rate of return on our portfolio, the use of leverage would result in a lower rate of return to the holders of common stock than if we had not issued the preferred stock or convertible debt securities. Any decline in the net asset value of our investment would be borne entirely by the holders of our common stock. Therefore, if the market value of our portfolio were to decline, the leverage would result in a greater decrease in net asset value to the holders of our common stock than if we were not leveraged through the issuance of preferred stock or debt securities. This decline in net asset value would also tend to cause a greater decline in the market price, if any, for our common stock. 

There is also a risk that, in the event of a sharp decline in the value of our net assets, we would be in danger of failing to maintain required asset coverage ratios, which may be required by the preferred stock or convertible debt, or our current investment income might not be sufficient to meet the dividend requirements on the preferred stock or the interest payments on the debt securities. In order to counteract such an event, we might need to liquidate investments in order to fund the redemption of some or all of the preferred stock or convertible debt. In addition, we would pay (and the holders of our common stock would bear) all costs and expenses relating to the issuance and ongoing maintenance of the preferred stock, convertible debt, or any combination of these securities. Holders of preferred stock or convertible debt may have different interests than holders of common stock and may at times have disproportionate influence over our affairs. 

Holders of any preferred stock that we may issue will have the right to elect certain members of the Board and have class voting rights on certain matters. 

The 1940 Act requires that holders of shares of preferred stock must be entitled as a class to elect two directors at all times and to elect a majority of the directors if dividends on such preferred stock are in arrears by two years or more, until such arrearage is eliminated. In addition, certain matters under the 1940 Act require the separate vote of the holders of any issued and outstanding preferred stock, including changes in fundamental investment restrictions and conversion to open end status and, accordingly, preferred shareholders could veto any such changes. Restrictions imposed on the declarations and payment of dividends or other distributions to the holders of our common stock and preferred stock, both by the 1940 Act and by requirements imposed by rating agencies, might impair our ability to maintain our tax treatment as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our board of directors has passed a resolution that no preferred stock will be issued that has voting rights that will limit or subordinate voting rights of the holders of our common stock afforded by the Omnibus Guidelines issued by NASAA. However, there can be no assurance that our Board will not issue preferred stock in the future. 

Compliance with the SEC&#8217;s Regulation Best Interest by participating broker-dealers may negatively impact our ability to raise capital in our offering, which would harm our ability to achieve our investment objectives. 

Commencing June 30, 2020, broker-dealers must comply with Regulation Best Interest, which, among other requirements, establishes a new standard of conduct for broker-dealers and their associated persons when making a recommendation of any securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities to a retail customer. Under Regulation Best Interest, high cost, high risk and complex products may be subject to greater scrutiny by broker-dealers and their salespersons. Regulation Best Interest imposes a duty of care for broker-dealers and their salespersons. Reasonable alternatives to us, such as listed entities, exist and may have lower expenses, less complexity and/or lower investment risk than us. Certain investments in listed entities may involved lower or no commissions at the time of initial purchase. Under Regulation Best Interest, broker-dealers participating in the offering must consider such alternatives in the best interest of their clients. The impact of Regulation Best Interest on participating dealers cannot be determined at this time, and it may negatively impact whether participating dealers and their associated persons recommend our offering to certain retail customers. If Regulation Best Interest reduces our ability to raise capital in our offering, it would harm our ability to create a diversified portfolio of investments and ability to achieve our investment objectives. 

Risks Related to an Investment in our Unsecured Notes 

Our unsecured notes are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness we have currently incurred or may incur in the future. 

We have issued notes that are unsecured by any of our assets or any of the assets of our subsidiaries. As a result, these notes are effectively subordinated, or junior, to any secured indebtedness or other obligations we or our subsidiaries have currently incurred and may incur in the future (or any indebtedness that is initially unsecured that we later secure) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. Substantially all of our subsidiaries&#8217; assets are currently pledged as collateral under our credit facilities or in connection with our CLOs. In any liquidation, dissolution, bankruptcy or other similar proceeding, the holders of any of our existing or future secured indebtedness and the secured indebtedness of our subsidiaries may assert rights against the assets pledged to secure that indebtedness in order to receive full payment of their indebtedness before the assets may be used to pay other creditors, including the holders of the unsecured notes. Secured indebtedness is effectively senior to the Notes to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. 

Our unsecured notes are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. 

The unsecured notes are exclusively our obligations and not of any of our subsidiaries. None of our subsidiaries are a guarantor of the unsecured notes and the unsecured notes are not required to be guaranteed by any subsidiaries we may acquire or create in the future. Except to the extent we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, all claims of creditors (including trade creditors) and holders of preferred stock, if any, of our subsidiaries will have priority over our equity interests in such subsidiaries (and therefore the claims of our creditors, including holders of the unsecured notes) with respect to the assets of such subsidiaries. Even if we are recognized as a creditor of one or more of our subsidiaries, our claims would still be effectively subordinated to any security interests in the assets of any such subsidiary and to any indebtedness or other liabilities of any such subsidiary senior to our claims. Consequently, our unsecured notes will be structurally subordinated, or junior, to our SPV Asset Facilities, CLOs and all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations (including trade payables) incurred by any of our subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities and any subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities that we may in the future acquire or establish. Our subsidiaries may incur indebtedness in the future, all of which would be structurally senior to the unsecured notes. 

A downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of the credit rating assigned by a rating agency to us or our notes, if any, or change in the debt markets, could cause the liquidity or market value of our notes to decline significantly. 

Our credit ratings are an assessment by rating agencies of our ability to pay our debts when due. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of our notes. These credit ratings may not reflect the potential impact of risks relating to the structure or marketing of our notes. Credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization in its sole discretion. 

An increase in market interest rates could result in a decrease in the market value of our unsecured notes. 

The condition of the financial markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future, which could have an adverse effect on the market prices of our unsecured notes. In general, as market interest rates rise, debt securities bearing interest at fixed rates of interest decline in value. We cannot predict the future level of market interest rates. 

The indenture under which the unsecured notes were issued contains limited protection for holders of our unsecured notes. 

The indenture offers limited protection to holders of our unsecured notes. The terms of the indenture and the unsecured notes do not restrict our or any of our subsidiaries&#8217; ability to engage in, or otherwise be a party to, a variety of corporate transactions, circumstances or events that could have an adverse impact on your investment in the unsecured notes. In particular, the terms of the indenture and the unsecured notes will not place any restrictions on our or our subsidiaries&#8217; ability to: 

&#8226; issue securities or otherwise incur additional indebtedness or other obligations other than an incurrence of indebtedness or other obligations that would cause a violation of Section 18(a)(1)(A) as modified by Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act or any successor provisions of the 1940 Act, but giving effect, in either case, to any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC. Currently, these provisions generally prohibit us from incurring additional borrowings, including through the issuance of additional debt securities, unless our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 150% after such borrowings; 

&#8226; pay dividends on, or purchase or redeem or make any payments in respect of, capital stock or other securities ranking junior in right of payment to the unsecured notes; 

&#8226; sell assets (other than certain limited restrictions on our ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets); 

&#8226; create liens (including liens on the shares of our subsidiaries) or enter into sale and leaseback transactions; 

&#8226; enter into transactions with affiliates; 

&#8226; make investments; or 

&#8226; create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our subsidiaries. 

Furthermore, the terms of the indenture and the unsecured notes do not protect holders of the unsecured notes in the event that we experience changes (including significant adverse changes) in our financial condition, results of operations or credit ratings, as they do not require that we or our subsidiaries adhere to any financial tests or ratios or specified levels of net worth, revenues, income, cash flow or liquidity. 

Our ability to recapitalize, incur additional debt and take a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the unsecured notes may have important consequences for you as a holder of the unsecured notes, including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the unsecured notes or negatively affecting the trading value of the unsecured notes. 

Certain of our current debt instruments include more protections for their holders than the indenture and the unsecured notes. In addition, other debt we issue or incur in the future could contain more protections for its holders than the indenture and the unsecured notes, including additional covenants and events of default. The issuance or incurrence of any such debt with incremental protections could affect the market for and trading levels and prices of the unsecured notes. 

The optional redemption provision may materially adversely affect your return on the unsecured notes. 

The unsecured notes are redeemable in whole or in part at any time or from time to time at our option. We may choose to redeem the unsecured notes at times when prevailing interest rates are lower than the interest rate paid on the unsecured notes. In this circumstance, you may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as that of the unsecured notes being redeemed. 

We may not be able to repurchase the unsecured notes upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event. 

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Repurchase Event, as defined in the indenture that governs the unsecured notes, as supplemented, subject to certain conditions, we will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding unsecured notes at 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The source of funds for that purchase of the unsecured notes will be our available cash or cash generated from our operations or other potential sources, including borrowings, investment repayments, sales of assets or sales of equity. We cannot assure you that sufficient funds from such sources will be available at the time of any Change of Control Repurchase Event to make required repurchases of the unsecured notes tendered. Our debt instruments may contain restrictions and provisions that we would have to comply with in connection with any repurchase of the unsecured notes. If the holders of the unsecured notes exercise their right to require us to repurchase all the unsecured notes upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event, the financial effect of this repurchase could cause a default under our existing or future debt instruments, even if the Change of Control Repurchase Event itself would not cause a default. It is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of the Change of Control Repurchase Event to make the required repurchase of the unsecured notes or our other debt. 

If an active trading market does not develop for the unsecured notes, you may not be able to resell them. 

We do not intend to apply for listing of the unsecured notes on any securities exchange or for quotation of the unsecured notes on any automated dealer quotation system. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell the unsecured notes at their fair market value or at all. If the unsecured notes are traded after their initial issuance, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our credit ratings, general economic 

conditions, our financial condition, performance and prospects and other factors. We cannot assure you that a liquid trading market will develop for the unsecured notes, that you will be able to sell the unsecured notes at a particular time or that the price you receive when you sell will be favorable. To the extent an active trading market does not develop for the unsecured notes, the liquidity and trading price for the unsecured notes may be harmed. Accordingly, you may be required to bear the financial risk of an investment in the unsecured notes for an indefinite period of time. 

Risks Related to U.S. Federal Income Tax 

We cannot predict how new tax legislation will affect us, our investments, or our stockholders, and any such legislation could adversely affect our business. 

Legislative or other actions relating to taxes could have a negative effect on us. The laws pertaining to U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department. The likelihood of any such legislation being enacted is uncertain. New legislation and any U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions interpreting such legislation could have adverse tax consequences, such as significantly and negatively affecting our ability to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC or negatively affecting the U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to us and our investors as a result of such qualification. Shareholders are urged to consult with their tax advisor regarding tax legislative, regulatory, or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our common stock. 

We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax imposed at corporate rates if we are unable to maintain our tax treatment as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code or if we make investments through taxable subsidiaries. 

To maintain RIC tax treatment under the Code, we must meet the following minimum annual distribution, income source and asset diversification requirements. See &#8220; ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#8212; Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations .&#8221; 

The Annual Distribution Requirement for a RIC generally will be satisfied if we distribute to our shareholders on an annual basis at least 90% of our &#8220;investment company taxable income,&#8221; which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short term capital gains over realized net long term capital losses. In addition, a RIC may, in certain cases, satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement by distributing dividends relating to a taxable year after the close of such taxable year under the &#8220;spillover dividend&#8221; provisions of Subchapter M. We would be subject to U.S. federal income tax imposed, at corporate rates, on retained income and/or gains, including any short term capital gains or long term capital gains. We also must make distributions to satisfy the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement and avoid a 4% excise tax on certain undistributed income. Because we may use debt financing, we are subject to (i) an asset coverage ratio requirement under the 1940 Act and may, in the future, be subject to (ii) certain financial covenants under loan and credit agreements that could, under certain circumstances, restrict us from making distributions necessary to satisfy the distribution requirements. If we are unable to obtain cash from other sources, or choose or are required to retain a portion of our taxable income or gains, we could (1) be required to pay excise taxes and (2) fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment. If we fail to qualify for treatment as a RIC, and certain amelioration provisions are not applicable, we would be subject to U.S. federal income tax on all of our taxable income (including our net capital gains) imposed at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to our shareholders, nor would they be required to be made. 

The income source requirement will be satisfied if we obtain at least 90% of our annual income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to loans of certain securities, gains from the sale of stock or other securities or foreign currencies, net income from certain ""qualified publicly traded partnerships,"" or other income derived from the business of investing in stock or securities. 

The asset diversification requirement will be satisfied if we meet certain asset diversification requirements at the end of each quarter of our taxable year. Specifically, to satisfy this requirement (1) at least 50% of the value of our assets must consist of (i) cash, cash items (including receivables), U.S. government securities, securities of other RICs, and (ii) other acceptable securities if such securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and(2) no more than 25% of the value of our assets can be invested in (i) the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, (ii) the securities, other than the securities of other RICs of two or more issuers that are controlled, by us and which are determined under applicable Treasury regulations, to be engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses, or (iii) the securities of certain &#8220;qualified publicly traded partnerships (as defined by the Code).&#8221; Failure to meet these requirements may result in our having to dispose of certain investments quickly in order to prevent the loss of RIC status. Because most of our investments will be in private companies, and therefore will be relatively illiquid, any such dispositions could be made at disadvantageous prices and could result in substantial losses. 

If we fail to qualify for or maintain RIC tax treatment for any reason and are subject to U.S. federal income tax imposed at corporate rates, the resulting taxes could substantially reduce our net assets, the amount of income available for distribution, and the amount of our distributions. 

We may invest in certain debt and equity investments through taxable subsidiaries and the net taxable income of these taxable subsidiaries will be subject to U.S. federal income and state and local taxes. We may invest in certain foreign debt and equity investments, which could be subject to foreign taxes (such as income tax, withholding, and value added taxes). 

We may have difficulty paying our required distributions if we recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income. 

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive a corresponding payment in cash. For example, since we will likely hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having OID (such as debt instruments with PIK, secondary market purchases of debt securities at a discount to par, interest or, 

in certain cases, increasing interest rates or debt instruments that were issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the OID that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We may also have to include in income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as unrealized appreciation for foreign currency forward contracts and deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrants or stock. Furthermore, we may invest in non-U.S. corporations (or other non-U.S. entities treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that could be treated under the Code and U.S. Treasury regulations as &#8220;passive foreign investment companies&#8221; and/or &#8220;controlled foreign corporations.&#8221; The rules relating to investment in these types of non-U.S. entities are designed to limit deferral and generally require the current inclusion of income derived by the entity. In certain circumstances, this could require us to recognize income where we do not receive a corresponding payment in cash. 

Unrealized appreciation on derivatives, such as foreign currency forward contracts, may be included in taxable income while the receipt of cash may occur in a subsequent period when the related contract expires. Any unrealized depreciation on investments that the foreign currency forward contracts are designed to hedge are not currently deductible for tax purposes. This can result in increased taxable income whereby we may not have sufficient cash to pay distributions or we may opt to retain such taxable income and pay a 4% excise tax. In such cases we could still rely upon the &#8220;spillover provisions&#8221; to maintain RIC tax treatment. 

We anticipate that a portion of our income may constitute OID or other income required to be included in taxable income prior to receipt of cash. Further, we may elect to amortize market discounts with respect to debt securities acquired in the secondary market and include such amounts in our taxable income in the current year, instead of upon disposition, as an election not to do so would limit our ability to deduct interest expenses for tax purposes. Because any OID or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of the accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our shareholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even if we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. As a result, we may have difficulty meeting the Annual Distribution Requirement necessary to maintain RIC tax treatment under the Code. We may have to sell some of our investments at times and/or at prices we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital, make a partial share distribution, or forgo new investment opportunities for this purpose. If we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, and choose not to make a qualifying share distribution, we may fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment and thus become subject to U.S. federal income tax. 

If we are not treated as a &#8220;publicly offered regulated investment company,&#8221; as defined in the Code, certain U.S. shareholders will be treated as having received a dividend from us in the amount of such U.S. shareholders&#8217; allocable share of the base management fee and incentive fees paid to our Adviser and some of our expenses, and these fees and expenses will be treated as miscellaneous itemized deductions of such U.S. shareholders. 

A &#8220;publicly offered regulated investment company&#8221; is a RIC whose shares are either (i) continuously offered pursuant to a public offering within the meaning of Section 4 of the Securities Act, (ii) regularly traded on an established securities market or (iii) held by at least 500 persons at all times during the taxable year. While we anticipate that we will constitute a publicly offered RIC, there can be no assurance that we will in fact so qualify for any of our taxable years. If we are not treated as a publicly offered regulated investment company for any calendar year, each U.S. shareholder that is an individual, trust or estate will be treated as having received a dividend from us in the amount of such U.S. shareholder&#8217;s allocable share of the base management fee and incentive fees paid to our Adviser and certain of our other expenses for the calendar year, and these fees and expenses will be treated as miscellaneous itemized deductions of such U.S. shareholder. 

General Risk Factors 

Changes in laws or regulations governing our operations may adversely affect our business or cause us to alter our business strategy. 

We and our portfolio companies are subject to regulation by laws at the local, state, and federal levels. These laws and regulations, as well as their interpretation, could change from time to time, including as the result of interpretive guidance or other directives from the new U.S. Presidential administration, and new laws, regulations and interpretations could also come into effect. Any new or changed laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, and political uncertainty could increase regulatory uncertainty in the near term. 

As a result of the 2024 U.S. election, a single political party currently controls both the executive and legislative branches of government, which increases the likelihood that legislation may be adopted that could significantly affect the regulation of U.S. financial markets. Regulatory changes could result in greater competition from banks and other lenders with which we compete for lending and other investment opportunities. The United States may also potentially withdraw from or renegotiate various trade agreements and take other actions that would change current trade policies of the United States. In addition, in June 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed its longstanding approach under the Chevron doctrine, which provided for judicial deference to regulatory agencies. As a result of this decision, we cannot be sure whether there will be increased challenges to existing agency regulations or how lower courts will apply the decision in the context of other regulatory schemes without more specific guidance from the U.S. Supreme Court. For example, the U.S. Supreme Court's decision could significantly impact consumer protection, advertising, privacy, artificial intelligence, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering practices and other regulatory regimes with which we are required to comply. Any such regulatory developments could result in uncertainty about and changes in the ways such regulations apply to us, and may require additional resources to ensure our continued compliance. We cannot predict which, if any, of these actions will be taken or, if taken, their effect on the financial stability of the United States. Such actions could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Changes to the laws and regulations governing our permitted investments may require a change to our investment strategy. Such changes could differ materially from our strategies and plans as set forth in this report and may shift our investment focus from the areas of expertise of our Adviser. Thus, any such changes, if they occur, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment in us. 

Heightened scrutiny of the financial services industry by regulators may materially and adversely affect our business. 

The financial services industry has been the subject of heightened scrutiny by regulators around the globe. In particular, the SEC and its staff have focused more narrowly on issues relevant to alternative asset management firms, including by forming specialized units devoted to examining such firms and, in certain cases, bringing enforcement actions against the firms, their principals and employees. In recent periods there have been a number of enforcement actions within the industry, and it is expected that the SEC will continue to pursue enforcement actions against asset managers. 

While the SEC&#8217;s recent lists of examination priorities include such items as assessments of investment advisers&#8217; marketing practices, compensation arrangements and controls to protect non-public information, it is generally expected that the SEC&#8217;s oversight of alternative asset managers will continue to focus substantially on concerns related to fiduciary duty transparency and investor disclosure practices. Although the SEC has cited improvements in disclosures and industry practices in this area, it has also indicated that there is room for improvement in particular areas, including fees and expenses (and the allocation of such fees and expenses) and co-investment practices. To this end, many investment advisory firms have received inquiries during examinations or directly from the SEC&#8217;s Division of Enforcement regarding various transparency-related topics, including the acceleration of monitoring fees, the allocation of broken-deal expenses, outside business activities of firm principals and employees, group purchasing arrangements and general conflicts of interest disclosures. While we believe we have made appropriate and timely disclosures regarding the foregoing, the SEC staff may disagree. 

Further, the SEC has highlighted BDC board oversight and valuation practices as one of its areas of focus in investment adviser examinations and has instituted enforcement actions against advisers for misleading investors about valuation. 

If the SEC were to investigate our Adviser and find errors in its methodologies or procedures, our Adviser could be subject to penalties and fines, which could in turn harm our reputation and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Similarly, from time to time we or our Adviser could become the subject of litigation or other similar claims. Any investigations, litigation or similar claims could continue without resolution for long periods of time and could consume substantial amounts of our management&#8217;s time and attention, and that time and attention and the devotion of associated resources could, at times, be disproportionate to the amounts at stake. Investigations, litigations and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties, and a material adverse impact on our financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome in an investigation, litigation or other similar claims becomes probable and reasonably estimable. In addition, we could incur expenses associated with defending ourselves against investigations, litigation and other similar claims, and these expenses could be material to our earnings in future periods. 

Government intervention in the credit markets could adversely affect our business . 

The central banks and, in particular, the U.S. Federal Reserve, have taken unprecedented steps in response to inflationary pressures. It is impossible to predict if, how, and to what extent the United States and other governments would further intervene in the credit markets. Such intervention is often prompted by politically sensitive issues involving family homes, student loans, real estate speculation, credit card receivables, pandemics, etc., and could, as a result, be contrary to what we would predict from an &#8220;economically rational&#8221; perspective. 

On the other hand, recent governmental intervention could mean that the willingness of governmental bodies to take additional extraordinary action is diminished. As a result, in the event of near-term major market disruptions, there might be only limited additional government intervention, resulting in correspondingly greater market dislocation and materially greater market risk. 

Provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law and of our charter and bylaws could deter takeover attempts and have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. 

The Maryland General Corporation Law (the &#8220;MGCL&#8221;), our charter and our bylaws contain provisions that may discourage, delay or make more difficult a change in control of the Company or the removal of our directors. We are subject to the Maryland Business Combination Act (the &#8220;Business Combination Act&#8221;), subject to any applicable requirements of the 1940 Act. Our board of directors has adopted a resolution exempting from the Business Combination Act any business combination between us and any other person, subject to prior approval of such business combination by our board, including approval by a majority of our disinterested directors. If the resolution exempting business combinations is repealed or our board or disinterested directors do not approve a business combination, the Business Combination Act may discourage third parties from trying to acquire control of us and may increase the difficulty of consummating such an offer. Our bylaws exempt from the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act (the &#8220;Control Share Acquisition Act&#8221;) acquisitions of our stock by any person. If we amend our bylaws to repeal the exemption from the Control Share Acquisition Act, subject to any applicable requirements of the 1940 Act, the Control Share Acquisition Act also may make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of us and may increase the difficulty of consummating such an offer. 

We have also adopted measures that may make it difficult for a third party to obtain control of us, including provisions of our charter classifying our board of directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms, and provisions of our charter authorizing our board of directors to classify or reclassify shares of our stock into one or more classes or series, to cause the issuance of additional shares of our stock, and to amend our charter from time to time, without stockholder approval, to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue. These 

provisions, as well as other provisions of our charter and bylaws, may discourage, delay, defer, make more difficult or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in stockholders&#8217; best interest. 

Our Bylaws include an exclusive forum selection provision, which could limit our shareholders&#8217; ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other agents. 

Our Bylaws require that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (or, if that court does not have jurisdiction, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Northern Division) shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of any standard of conduct or legal duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other agents to us or to our shareholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the MGCL or the Charter or the Bylaws (as either may be amended from time to time), or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum selection provision in our Bylaws will not apply to claims arising under the federal securities laws, including the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. There is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such a provision, and investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. In addition, this provision may increase costs for shareholders in bringing a claim against us or our directors, officers or other agents. Any investor purchasing or otherwise acquiring our shares is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provision. The exclusive forum selection provision in our Bylaws may limit our shareholders&#8217; ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other agents, which may discourage lawsuits against us and such persons. It is also possible that, notwithstanding such exclusive forum selection provision, a court could rule that such provision is inapplicable or unenforceable. If this occurred, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in another forum, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We expend significant financial and other resources to comply with the requirements of being a public entity. 

As a public entity, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, which are discussed below. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls, significant resources and management oversight are required. We have implemented procedures, processes, policies and practices for the purpose of addressing the standards and requirements applicable to public companies. These activities may divert management&#8217;s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

We may experience fluctuations in our operating results. 

We may experience fluctuations in our operating results due to a number of factors, including our ability or inability to make investments in companies that meet our investment criteria, interest rates and default rates on the debt investments we make, the level of our expenses, variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized gains or losses, unrealized appreciation or depreciation, the degree to which we encounter competition in our markets, and general economic conditions. These occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, the value of your investment in us and our ability to pay distributions to you and our other shareholders. 

We are subject to risks in using custodians, counterparties, administrators and other agents. 

We depend on the services of custodians, counterparties, administrators and other agents to carry out certain transactions and other administrative services, including compliance with regulatory requirements in U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. We are subject to risks of errors and mistakes made by these third parties, which may be attributed to us and subject us or our shareholders to reputational damage, penalties or losses. We depend on third parties to provide primary and back up communications and information systems. Any failure or interruption of those systems, including as a result of the termination of an agreement with any third-party service providers, could cause delays or other problems in our activities. Our financial, accounting, data processing, portfolio monitoring, backup or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. The terms of the contracts with third-party service providers are often customized and complex, and many of these arrangements occur in markets or relate to products that are not subject to regulatory oversight. Accordingly, we may be unsuccessful in seeking reimbursement or indemnification from these third-party service providers. In addition, we rely on a select number of third-party services providers and replacement of any one of our service providers could be difficult and result in disruption and expense.
